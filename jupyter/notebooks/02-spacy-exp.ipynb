      "In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to effectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep models trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain and easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive edges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these region-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation model training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists of two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple sightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The statistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the model's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new mutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability output and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the model's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant and low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order to learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation results of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on three public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.\n",

      "The recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) combined with the extensive amount of data generated by today's clinical systems, has led to the development of imaging AI solutions across the whole value chain of medical imaging, including image reconstruction, medical image segmentation, image-based diagnosis and treatment planning. Notwithstanding the successes and future potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of the potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are perceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust in critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are currently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI developments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding principles drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best practices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These guiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i) Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness and (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are further translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying, developing, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically trustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.\n",
      "In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to effectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep models trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain and easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive edges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these region-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation model training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists of two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple sightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The statistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the model's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new mutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability output and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the model's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant and low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order to learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation results of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on three public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.\n",
      "To mitigate the radiologist's workload, computer-aided diagnosis with the capability to review and analyze medical images is gradually deployed. Deep learning-based region of interest segmentation is among the most exciting use cases. However, this paradigm is restricted in real-world clinical applications due to poor robustness and generalization. The issue is more sinister with a lack of training data. In this paper, we address the challenge from the representation learning point of view. We investigate that the collapsed representations, as one of the main reasons which caused poor robustness and generalization, could be avoided through transfer learning. Therefore, we propose a novel two-stage framework for robust generalized segmentation. In particular, an unsupervised Tile-wise AutoEncoder (T-AE) pretraining architecture is coined to learn meaningful representation for improving the generalization and robustness of the downstream tasks. Furthermore, the learned knowledge is transferred to the segmentation benchmark. Coupled with an image reconstruction network, the representation keeps to be decoded, encouraging the model to capture more semantic features. Experiments of lung segmentation on multi chest X-ray datasets are conducted. Empirically, the related experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of the proposed framework on unseen domains in terms of high performance and robustness to corruption, especially under the scenario of the limited training data.\n",
      "Image segmentation is often ambiguous at the level of individual image patches and requires contextual information to reach label consensus. In this paper we introduce Segmenter, a transformer model for semantic segmentation. In contrast to convolution-based methods, our approach allows to model global context already at the first layer and throughout the network. We build on the recent Vision Transformer (ViT) and extend it to semantic segmentation. To do so, we rely on the output embeddings corresponding to image patches and obtain class labels from these embeddings with a point-wise linear decoder or a mask transformer decoder. We leverage models pre-trained for image classification and show that we can fine-tune them on moderate sized datasets available for semantic segmentation. The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results already, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer generating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the impact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for large models and small patch sizes. Segmenter attains excellent results for semantic segmentation. It outperforms the state of the art on both ADE20K and Pascal Context datasets and is competitive on Cityscapes.\n",
      "Deep reinforcement learning augments the reinforcement learning framework and utilizes the powerful representation of deep neural networks. Recent works have demonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various domains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and computer vision. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances of deep reinforcement learning in computer vision. We start with comprehending the theories of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning. We then propose a categorization of deep reinforcement learning methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide deep reinforcement learning into seven main categories according to their applications in computer vision, i.e. (i)landmark localization (ii) object detection; (iii) object tracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image volumetric data (v) image segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other applications. Each of these categories is further analyzed with reinforcement learning techniques, network design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code availability. Finally, we present some open issues and discuss future research directions on deep reinforcement learning in computer vision\n",
      "Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts, and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of 90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream tasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.\n",
      "Accurate automatic liver and tumor segmentation plays a vital role in treatment planning and disease monitoring. Recently, deep convolutional neural network (DCNNs) has obtained tremendous success in 2D and 3D medical image segmentation. However, 2D DCNNs cannot fully leverage the inter-slice information, while 3D DCNNs are computationally expensive and memory intensive. To address these issues, we first propose a novel dense-sparse training flow from a data perspective, in which, densely adjacent slices and sparsely adjacent slices are extracted as inputs for regularizing DCNNs, thereby improving the model performance. Moreover, we design a 2.5D light-weight nnU-Net from a network perspective, in which, depthwise separable convolutions are adopted to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on the LiTS dataset have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.\n",
      "While improving prediction accuracy has been the focus of machine learning in recent years, this alone does not suffice for reliable decision-making. Deploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating and communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise uncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued predictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future test points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit finite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate the size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple, distribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it in five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems where some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label classification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3) classification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4) image segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an object of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss extensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and distributionally robust learning.\n",
      "Accurate image segmentation plays a crucial role in medical image analysis, yet it faces great challenges of various shapes, diverse sizes, and blurry boundaries. To address these difficulties, square kernel-based encoder-decoder architecture has been proposed and widely used, but its performance remains still unsatisfactory. To further cope with these challenges, we present a novel double-branch encoder architecture. Our architecture is inspired by two observations: 1) Since the discrimination of features learned via square convolutional kernels needs to be further improved, we propose to utilize non-square vertical and horizontal convolutional kernels in the double-branch encoder, so features learned by the two branches can be expected to complement each other. 2) Considering that spatial attention can help models to better focus on the target region in a large-sized image, we develop an attention loss to further emphasize the segmentation on small-sized targets. Together, the above two schemes give rise to a novel double-branch encoder segmentation framework for medical image segmentation, namely Crosslink-Net. The experiments validate the effectiveness of our model on four datasets. The code is released at https://github.com/Qianyu1226/Crosslink-Net.\n",
      "In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis has become an increasingly popular topic. Methods based on convolutional neural networks have achieved good performance in medical image segmentation and classification. Due to the limitations of the convolution operation, the long-term spatial features are often not accurately obtained. Hence, we propose a TransClaw U-Net network structure, which combines the convolution operation with the transformer operation in the encoding part. The convolution part is applied for extracting the shallow spatial features to facilitate the recovery of the image resolution after upsampling. The transformer part is used to encode the patches, and the self-attention mechanism is used to obtain global information between sequences. The decoding part retains the bottom upsampling structure for better detail segmentation performance. The experimental results on Synapse Multi-organ Segmentation Datasets show that the performance of TransClaw U-Net is better than other network structures. The ablation experiments also prove the generalization performance of TransClaw U-Net.\n",
      "Medical image segmentation - the prerequisite of numerous clinical needs - has been significantly prospered by recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it exhibits general limitations on modeling explicit long-range relation, and existing cures, resorting to building deep encoders along with aggressive downsampling operations, leads to redundant deepened networks and loss of localized details. Hence, the segmentation task awaits a better solution to improve the efficiency of modeling global contexts while maintaining a strong grasp of low-level details. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel-in-branch architecture, TransFuse, to address this challenge. TransFuse combines Transformers and CNNs in a parallel style, where both global dependency and low-level spatial details can be efficiently captured in a much shallower manner. Besides, a novel fusion technique - BiFusion module is created to efficiently fuse the multi-level features from both branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransFuse achieves the newest state-of-the-art results on both 2D and 3D medical image sets including polyp, skin lesion, hip, and prostate segmentation, with significant parameter decrease and inference speed improvement.\n",
      "Assigning meaning to parts of image data is the goal of semantic image segmentation. Machine learning methods, specifically supervised learning is commonly used in a variety of tasks formulated as semantic segmentation. One of the major challenges in the supervised learning approaches is expressing and collecting the rich knowledge that experts have with respect to the meaning present in the image data. Towards this, typically a fixed set of labels is specified and experts are tasked with annotating the pixels, patches or segments in the images with the given labels. In general, however, the set of classes does not fully capture the rich semantic information present in the images. For example, in medical imaging such as histology images, the different parts of cells could be grouped and sub-grouped based on the expertise of the pathologist.   To achieve such a precise semantic representation of the concepts in the image, we need access to the full depth of knowledge of the annotator. In this work, we develop a novel approach to collect segmentation annotations from experts based on psychometric testing. Our method consists of the psychometric testing procedure, active query selection, query enhancement, and a deep metric learning model to achieve a patch-level image embedding that allows for semantic segmentation of images. We show the merits of our method with evaluation on the synthetically generated image, aerial image and histology image.\n",
      "A strong visual object tracker nowadays relies on its well-crafted modules, which typically consist of manually-designed network architectures to deliver high-quality tracking results. Not surprisingly, the manual design process becomes a particularly challenging barrier, as it demands sufficient prior experience, enormous effort, intuition and perhaps some good luck. Meanwhile, neural architecture search has gaining grounds in practical applications such as image segmentation, as a promising method in tackling the issue of automated search of feasible network structures. In this work, we propose a novel cell-level differentiable architecture search mechanism to automate the network design of the tracking module, aiming to adapt backbone features to the objective of a tracking network during offline training. The proposed approach is simple, efficient, and with no need to stack a series of modules to construct a network. Our approach is easy to be incorporated into existing trackers, which is empirically validated using different differentiable architecture search-based methods and tracking objectives. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over five commonly-used benchmarks. Meanwhile, our automated searching process takes 41 (18) hours for the second (first) order DARTS method on the TrackingNet dataset.\n",
      "Deep learning-based segmentation methods are vulnerable to unforeseen data distribution shifts during deployment, e.g. change of image appearances or contrasts caused by different scanners, unexpected imaging artifacts etc. In this paper, we present a cooperative framework for training image segmentation models and a latent space augmentation method for generating hard examples. Both contributions improve model generalization and robustness with limited data. The cooperative training framework consists of a fast-thinking network (FTN) and a slow-thinking network (STN). The FTN learns decoupled image features and shape features for image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. The STN learns shape priors for segmentation correction and refinement. The two networks are trained in a cooperative manner. The latent space augmentation generates challenging examples for training by masking the decoupled latent space in both channel-wise and spatial-wise manners. We performed extensive experiments on public cardiac imaging datasets. Using only 10 subjects from a single site for training, we demonstrated improved cross-site segmentation performance and increased robustness against various unforeseen imaging artifacts compared to strong baseline methods. Particularly, cooperative training with latent space data augmentation yields 15% improvement in terms of average Dice score when compared to a standard training method.\n",
      "This paper proposes two important contributions for conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to improve the wide variety of applications that exploit this architecture. The first main contribution is an analysis of cGANs to show that they are not explicitly conditional. In particular, it will be shown that the discriminator and subsequently the cGAN does not automatically learn the conditionality between inputs. The second contribution is a new method, called acontrario, that explicitly models conditionality for both parts of the adversarial architecture via a novel acontrario loss that involves training the discriminator to learn unconditional (adverse) examples. This leads to a novel type of data augmentation approach for GANs (acontrario learning) which allows to restrict the search space of the generator to conditional outputs using adverse examples. Extensive experimentation is carried out to evaluate the conditionality of the discriminator by proposing a probability distribution analysis. Comparisons with the cGAN architecture for different applications show significant improvements in performance on well known datasets including, semantic image synthesis, image segmentation and monocular depth prediction using different metrics including Fr\\'echet Inception Distance(FID), mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Root Mean Square Error log (RMSE log) and Number of statistically-Different Bins (NDB)\n",
      "Semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentations have been addressed using different and specialized frameworks despite their underlying connections. This paper presents a unified, simple, and effective framework for these essentially similar tasks. The framework, named K-Net, segments both instances and semantic categories consistently by a group of learnable kernels, where each kernel is responsible for generating a mask for either a potential instance or a stuff class. To remedy the difficulties of distinguishing various instances, we propose a kernel update strategy that enables each kernel dynamic and conditional on its meaningful group in the input image. K-Net can be trained in an end-to-end manner with bipartite matching, and its training and inference are naturally NMS-free and box-free. Without bells and whistles, K-Net surpasses all previous state-of-the-art single-model results of panoptic segmentation on MS COCO and semantic segmentation on ADE20K with 52.1% PQ and 54.3% mIoU, respectively. Its instance segmentation performance is also on par with Cascade Mask R-CNNon MS COCO with 60%-90% faster inference speeds. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.\n",
      "Transformer, which can benefit from global (long-range) information modeling using self-attention mechanisms, has been successful in natural language processing and 2D image classification recently. However, both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we for the first time exploit Transformer in 3D CNN for MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation and propose a novel network named TransBTS based on the encoder-decoder structure. To capture the local 3D context information, the encoder first utilizes 3D CNN to extract the volumetric spatial feature maps. Meanwhile, the feature maps are reformed elaborately for tokens that are fed into Transformer for global feature modeling. The decoder leverages the features embedded by Transformer and performs progressive upsampling to predict the detailed segmentation map. Extensive experimental results on both BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets show that TransBTS achieves comparable or higher results than previous state-of-the-art 3D methods for brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scans.

In this work, we tackle two defects that hinder their deployment in real-world applications: 1) Predictions lack uncertainty quantification that may be crucial to many decision-making systems; 2) Large memory storage and computational consumption demanding extensive hardware resources. To address these issues and improve their practicality we demonstrate a few-parameter compact Bayesian convolutional architecture, that achieves a marginal improvement in accuracy in comparison to related work using significantly fewer parameters and compute operations. The architecture combines parameter-efficient operations such as separable convolutions, bilinear interpolation, multi-scale feature propagation and Bayesian inference for per-pixel uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo Dropout. The best performing configurations required fewer than 2.5 million parameters on diverse challenging datasets with few observations.\n",
      "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled and unseen target domain, which is usually trained on data from both domains. Access to the source domain data at the adaptation stage, however, is often limited, due to data storage or privacy issues. To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for segmentation, and propose to adapt an ``off-the-shelf\" segmentation model pre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive batch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the domain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are gradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the consistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and shifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The transferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to balance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free UDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g., self-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our framework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our source free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for the cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the cross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods with the source data.\n",
      "Vision Transformers (ViT) have been shown to attain highly competitive performance for a wide range of vision applications, such as image classification, object detection and semantic image segmentation. In comparison to convolutional neural networks, the Vision Transformer's weaker inductive bias is generally found to cause an increased reliance on model regularization or data augmentation (``AugReg'' for short) when training on smaller training datasets. We conduct a systematic empirical study in order to better understand the interplay between the amount of training data, AugReg, model size and compute budget. As one result of this study we find that the combination of increased compute and AugReg can yield models with the same performance as models trained on an order of magnitude more training data: we train ViT models of various sizes on the public ImageNet-21k dataset which either match or outperform their counterparts trained on the larger, but not publicly available JFT-300M dataset.\n",
      "The joint use of multiple imaging modalities for medical image segmentation has been widely studied in recent years. The fusion of information from different modalities has demonstrated to improve the segmentation accuracy, with respect to mono-modal segmentations, in several applications. However, acquiring multiple modalities is usually not possible in a clinical setting due to a limited number of physicians and scanners, and to limit costs and scan time. Most of the time, only one modality is acquired. In this paper, we propose KD-Net, a framework to transfer knowledge from a trained multi-modal network (teacher) to a mono-modal one (student). The proposed method is an adaptation of the generalized distillation framework where the student network is trained on a subset (1 modality) of the teacher's inputs (n modalities). We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in brain tumor segmentation with the BraTS 2018 dataset. Using different architectures, we show that the student network effectively learns from the teacher and always outperforms the baseline mono-modal network in terms of segmentation accuracy.\n",
      "This paper addresses the domain shift problem for segmentation. As a solution, we propose OLVA, a novel and lightweight unsupervised domain adaptation method based on a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and Optimal Transport (OT) theory. Thanks to the VAE, our model learns a shared cross-domain latent space that follows a normal distribution, which reduces the domain shift. To guarantee valid segmentations, our shared latent space is designed to model the shape rather than the intensity variations. We further rely on an OT loss to match and align the remaining discrepancy between the two domains in the latent space. We demonstrate OLVA's effectiveness for the segmentation of multiple cardiac structures on the public Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) dataset, where the source domain consists of annotated 3D MR images and the unlabelled target domain of 3D CTs. Our results show remarkable improvements with an additional margin of 12.5\\% dice score over concurrent generative training approaches.\n",
      "Medical image segmentation is one of the important tasks of computer-aided diagnosis in medical image analysis. Since most medical images have the characteristics of blurred boundaries and uneven intensity distribution, through existing segmentation methods, the discontinuity within the target area and the discontinuity of the target boundary are likely to lead to rough or even erroneous boundary delineation. In this paper, we propose a new iterative refined interactive segmentation method for medical images based on agent reinforcement learning, which focuses on the problem of target segmentation boundaries. We model the dynamic process of drawing the target contour in a certain order as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based on a deep reinforcement learning method. In the dynamic process of continuous interaction between the agent and the image, the agent tracks the boundary point by point in order within a limited length range until the contour of the target is completely drawn. In this process, the agent can quickly improve the segmentation performance by exploring an interactive policy in the image. The method we proposed is simple and effective. At the same time, we evaluate our method on the cardiac MRI scan data set. Experimental results show that our method has a better segmentation effect on the left ventricle in a small number of medical image data sets, especially in terms of segmentation boundaries, this method is better than existing methods. Based on our proposed method, the dynamic generation process of the predicted contour trajectory of the left ventricle will be displayed online at https://github.com/H1997ym/LV-contour-trajectory.\n",
      "Contrastive learning has shown superior performance in embedding global and spatial invariant features in computer vision (e.g., image classification). However, its overall success of embedding local and spatial variant features is still limited, especially for semantic segmentation. In a per-pixel prediction task, more than one label can exist in a single image for segmentation (e.g., an image contains both cat, dog, and grass), thereby it is difficult to define 'positive' or 'negative' pairs in a canonical contrastive learning setting. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided supervised contrastive learning approach to highlight a single semantic object every time as the target. With our design, the same image can be embedded to different semantic clusters with semantic attention (i.e., coerce semantic masks) as an additional input channel. To achieve such attention, a novel two-stage training strategy is presented. We evaluate the proposed method on multi-organ medical image segmentation task, as our major task, with both in-house data and BTCV 2015 datasets. Comparing with the supervised and semi-supervised training state-of-the-art in the backbone of ResNet-50, our proposed pipeline yields substantial improvement of 5.53% and 6.09% in Dice score for both medical image segmentation cohorts respectively. The performance of the proposed method on natural images is assessed via PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and achieves 2.75% substantial improvement.\n",
      "Applications such as autonomous vehicles and medical screening use deep learning models to localize and identify hundreds of objects in a single frame. In the past, it has been shown how an attacker can fool these models by placing an adversarial patch within a scene. However, these patches must be placed in the target location and do not explicitly alter the semantics elsewhere in the image.   In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial patch which alters a model's perception of an image's semantics. These patches can be placed anywhere within an image to change the classification or semantics of locations far from the patch. We call this new class of adversarial examples `remote adversarial patches' (RAP).   We implement our own RAP called IPatch and perform an in-depth analysis on image segmentation RAP attacks using five state-of-the-art architectures with eight different encoders on the CamVid street view dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the attack can be extended to object recognition models with preliminary results on the popular YOLOv3 model. We found that the patch can change the classification of a remote target region with a success rate of up to 93% on average.\n",
      "Performing inference in graphs is a common task within several machine learning problems, e.g., image segmentation, community detection, among others. For a given undirected connected graph, we tackle the statistical problem of exactly recovering an unknown ground-truth binary labeling of the nodes from a single corrupted observation of each edge. Such problem can be formulated as a quadratic combinatorial optimization problem over the boolean hypercube, where it has been shown before that one can (with high probability and in polynomial time) exactly recover the ground-truth labeling of graphs that have an isoperimetric number that grows with respect to the number of nodes (e.g., complete graphs, regular expanders). In this work, we apply a powerful hierarchy of relaxations, known as the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy, to the combinatorial problem. Motivated by empirical evidence on the improvement in exact recoverability, we center our attention on the degree-4 SoS relaxation and set out to understand the origin of such improvement from a graph theoretical perspective. We show that the solution of the dual of the relaxed problem is related to finding edge weights of the Johnson and Kneser graphs, where the weights fulfill the SoS constraints and intuitively allow the input graph to increase its algebraic connectivity. Finally, as byproduct of our analysis, we derive a novel Cheeger-type lower bound for the algebraic connectivity of graphs with signed edge weights.\n",
      "We present a Neural Network based Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) model architecture that can be trained to recognize full pages of handwritten or printed text without image segmentation. Being based on Image to Sequence architecture, it can extract text present in an image and then sequence it correctly without imposing any constraints regarding orientation, layout and size of text and non-text. Further, it can also be trained to generate auxiliary markup related to formatting, layout and content. We use character level vocabulary, thereby enabling language and terminology of any subject. The model achieves a new state-of-art in paragraph level recognition on the IAM dataset. When evaluated on scans of real world handwritten free form test answers - beset with curved and slanted lines, drawings, tables, math, chemistry and other symbols - it performs better than all commercially available HTR cloud APIs. It is deployed in production as part of a commercial web application.\n",
      "Recent research has shown that numerous human-interpretable directions exist in the latent space of GANs. In this paper, we develop an automatic procedure for finding directions that lead to foreground-background image separation, and we use these directions to train an image segmentation model without human supervision. Our method is generator-agnostic, producing strong segmentation results with a wide range of different GAN architectures. Furthermore, by leveraging GANs pretrained on large datasets such as ImageNet, we are able to segment images from a range of domains without further training or finetuning. Evaluating our method on image segmentation benchmarks, we compare favorably to prior work while using neither human supervision nor access to the training data. Broadly, our results demonstrate that automatically extracting foreground-background structure from pretrained deep generative models can serve as a remarkably effective substitute for human supervision.\n",
      "Medical image segmentation models are typically supervised by expert annotations at the pixel-level, which can be expensive to acquire. In this work, we propose a method that combines the high quality of pixel-level expert annotations with the scale of coarse DNN-generated saliency maps for training multi-label semantic segmentation models. We demonstrate the application of our semi-supervised method, which we call CheXseg, on multi-label chest X-ray interpretation. We find that CheXseg improves upon the performance (mIoU) of fully-supervised methods that use only pixel-level expert annotations by 9.7% and weakly-supervised methods that use only DNN-generated saliency maps by 73.1%. Our best method is able to match radiologist agreement on three out of ten pathologies and reduces the overall performance gap by 57.2% as compared to weakly-supervised methods.\n",
      "Scalable sensor simulation is an important yet challenging open problem for safety-critical domains such as self-driving. Current works in image simulation either fail to be photorealistic or do not model the 3D environment and the dynamic objects within, losing high-level control and physical realism. In this paper, we present GeoSim, a geometry-aware image composition process which synthesizes novel urban driving scenarios by augmenting existing images with dynamic objects extracted from other scenes and rendered at novel poses. Towards this goal, we first build a diverse bank of 3D objects with both realistic geometry and appearance from sensor data. During simulation, we perform a novel geometry-aware simulation-by-composition procedure which 1) proposes plausible and realistic object placements into a given scene, 2) render novel views of dynamic objects from the asset bank, and 3) composes and blends the rendered image segments. The resulting synthetic images are realistic, traffic-aware, and geometrically consistent, allowing our approach to scale to complex use cases. We demonstrate two such important applications: long-range realistic video simulation across multiple camera sensors, and synthetic data generation for data augmentation on downstream segmentation tasks. Please check https://tmux.top/publication/geosim/ for high-resolution video results.\n",
      "Incorporating shape information is essential for the delineation of many organs and anatomical structures in medical images. While previous work has mainly focused on parametric spatial transformations applied on reference template shapes, in this paper, we address the Bayesian inference of parametric shape models for segmenting medical images with the objective to provide interpretable results. The proposed framework defines a likelihood appearance probability and a prior label probability based on a generic shape function through a logistic function. A reference length parameter defined in the sigmoid controls the trade-off between shape and appearance information. The inference of shape parameters is performed within an Expectation-Maximisation approach where a Gauss-Newton optimization stage allows to provide an approximation of the posterior probability of shape parameters. This framework is applied to the segmentation of cochlea structures from clinical CT images constrained by a 10 parameter shape model. It is evaluated on three different datasets, one of which includes more than 200 patient images. The results show performances comparable to supervised methods and better than previously proposed unsupervised ones. It also enables an analysis of parameter distributions and the quantification of segmentation uncertainty including the effect of the shape model.\n",
      "Siamese-based trackers have achived promising performance on visual object tracking tasks. Most existing Siamese-based trackers contain two separate branches for tracking, including classification branch and bounding box regression branch. In addition, image segmentation provides an alternative way to obetain the more accurate target region. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker with two-stages: detection and segmentation. The detection stage is capable of locating the target by Siamese networks. Then more accurate tracking results are obtained by segmentation module given the coarse state estimation in the first stage. We conduct experiments on four benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, with the EAO of 52.6$\\%$ on VOT2016, 51.3$\\%$ on VOT2018, and 39.0$\\%$ on VOT2019 datasets, respectively.\n",
      "Training deep networks with limited labeled data while achieving a strong generalization ability is key in the quest to reduce human annotation efforts. This is the goal of semi-supervised learning, which exploits more widely available unlabeled data to complement small labeled data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative pixel-level tasks using a generative model of both images and labels. Concretely, we learn a generative adversarial network that captures the joint image-label distribution and is trained efficiently using a large set of unlabeled images supplemented with only few labeled ones. We build our architecture on top of StyleGAN2, augmented with a label synthesis branch. Image labeling at test time is achieved by first embedding the target image into the joint latent space via an encoder network and test-time optimization, and then generating the label from the inferred embedding. We evaluate our approach in two important domains: medical image segmentation and part-based face segmentation. We demonstrate strong in-domain performance compared to several baselines, and are the first to showcase extreme out-of-domain generalization, such as transferring from CT to MRI in medical imaging, and photographs of real faces to paintings, sculptures, and even cartoons and animal faces.

      "Semantic segmentation has a wide array of applications ranging from medical-image analysis, scene understanding, autonomous driving and robotic navigation. This work deals with medical image segmentation and in particular with accurate polyp detection and segmentation during colonoscopy examinations. Several convolutional neural network architectures have been proposed to effectively deal with this task and with the problem of segmenting objects at different scale input. The basic architecture in image segmentation consists of an encoder and a decoder: the first uses convolutional filters to extract features from the image, the second is responsible for generating the final output. In this work, we compare some variant of the DeepLab architecture obtained by varying the decoder backbone. We compare several decoder architectures, including ResNet, Xception, EfficentNet, MobileNet and we perturb their layers by substituting ReLU activation layers with other functions. The resulting methods are used to create deep ensembles which are shown to be very effective. Our experimental evaluations show that our best ensemble produces good segmentation results by achieving high evaluation scores with a dice coefficient of 0.884, and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.818 for the Kvasir-SEG dataset.

      "Deep Metric Learning (DML) is helpful in computer vision tasks. In this paper, we firstly introduce DML into image co-segmentation. We propose a novel Triplet loss for Image Segmentation, called IS-Triplet loss for short, and combine it with traditional image segmentation loss. Different from the general DML task which learns the metric between pictures, we treat each pixel as a sample, and use their embedded features in high-dimensional space to form triples, then we tend to force the distance between pixels of different categories greater than of the same category by optimizing IS-Triplet loss so that the pixels from different categories are easier to be distinguished in the high-dimensional feature space. We further present an efficient triple sampling strategy to make a feasible computation of IS-Triplet loss. Finally, the IS-Triplet loss is combined with 3 traditional image segmentation losses to perform image segmentation. We apply the proposed approach to image co-segmentation and test it on the SBCoseg dataset and the Internet dataset. The experimental result shows that our approach can effectively improve the discrimination of pixels' categories in high-dimensional space and thus help traditional loss achieve better performance of image segmentation with fewer training epochs.\n",
      "Confused about renovating your space? Choosing the perfect color for your walls is always a challenging task. One does rounds of color consultation and several patch tests. This paper proposes an AI tool to pitch paint based on attributes of your room and other furniture, and visualize it on your walls. It makes the color selection process easy. It takes in images of a room, detects furniture objects using YOLO object detection. Once these objects have been detected, the tool picks out color of the object. Later this object specific information gets appended to the room attributes (room_type, room_size, preferred_tone, etc) and a deep neural net is trained to make predictions for color/texture/wallpaper for the walls. Finally, these predictions are visualized on the walls from the images provided. The idea is to take the knowledge of a color consultant and pitch colors that suit the walls and provide a good contrast with the furniture and harmonize with different colors in the room. Transfer learning for YOLO object detection from the COCO dataset was used as a starting point and the weights were later fine-tuned by training on additional images. The model was trained on 1000 records listing the room and furniture attributes, to predict colors. Given the room image, this method finds the best color scheme for the walls. These predictions are then visualized on the walls in the image using image segmentation. The results are visually appealing and automatically enhance the color look-and-feel.\n",
      "In this paper, we present new image segmentation methods based on hidden Markov random fields (HMRFs) and cuckoo search (CS) variants. HMRFs model the segmentation problem as a minimization of an energy function. CS algorithm is one of the recent powerful optimization techniques. Therefore, five variants of the CS algorithm are used to compute a solution. Through tests, we conduct a study to choose the CS variant with parameters that give good results (execution time and quality of segmentation). CS variants are evaluated and compared with non-destructive testing (NDT) images using a misclassification error (ME) criterion.\n",
      "Considering the scarcity of medical data, most datasets in medical image analysis are an order of magnitude smaller than those of natural images. However, most Network Architecture Search (NAS) approaches in medical images focused on specific datasets and did not take into account the generalization ability of the learned architectures on unseen datasets as well as different domains. In this paper, we address this point by proposing to search for generalizable U-shape architectures on a composited dataset that mixes medical images from multiple segmentation tasks and domains creatively, which is named MixSearch. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to mix multiple small-scale datasets from multiple domains and segmentation tasks to produce a large-scale dataset. Then, a novel weaved encoder-decoder structure is designed to search for a generalized segmentation network in both cell-level and network-level. The network produced by the proposed MixSearch framework achieves state-of-the-art results compared with advanced encoder-decoder networks across various datasets.\n",
      "The success of modern deep learning algorithms for image segmentation heavily depends on the availability of large datasets with clean pixel-level annotations (masks), where the objects of interest are accurately delineated. Lack of time and expertise during data annotation leads to incorrect boundaries and label noise. It is known that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) can memorize even completely random labels, resulting in poor accuracy. We propose a framework to train binary segmentation DCNNs using sets of unreliable pixel-level annotations. Erroneously labeled pixels are identified based on the estimated aleatoric uncertainty of the segmentation and are relabeled to the true value.\n",
      "Image segmentation is one of the most essential biomedical image processing problems for different imaging modalities, including microscopy and X-ray in the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) domain. However, annotating biomedical images is knowledge-driven, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, making it difficult to obtain abundant labels with limited costs. Active learning strategies come into ease the burden of human annotation, which queries only a subset of training data for annotation. Despite receiving attention, most of active learning methods generally still require huge computational costs and utilize unlabeled data inefficiently. They also tend to ignore the intermediate knowledge within networks. In this work, we propose a deep active semi-supervised learning framework, DSAL, combining active learning and semi-supervised learning strategies. In DSAL, a new criterion based on deep supervision mechanism is proposed to select informative samples with high uncertainties and low uncertainties for strong labelers and weak labelers respectively. The internal criterion leverages the disagreement of intermediate features within the deep learning network for active sample selection, which subsequently reduces the computational costs. We use the proposed criteria to select samples for strong and weak labelers to produce oracle labels and pseudo labels simultaneously at each active learning iteration in an ensemble learning manner, which can be examined with IoMT Platform. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art active learning methods.\n",
      "Multi-modal medical image segmentation plays an essential role in clinical diagnosis. It remains challenging as the input modalities are often not well-aligned spatially. Existing learning-based methods mainly consider sharing trainable layers across modalities and minimizing visual feature discrepancies. While the problem is often formulated as joint supervised feature learning, multiple-scale features and class-specific representation have not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose an affinity-guided fully convolutional network for multimodal image segmentation. To learn effective representations, we design class-specific affinity matrices to encode the knowledge of hierarchical feature reasoning, together with the shared convolutional layers to ensure the cross-modality generalization. Our affinity matrix does not depend on spatial alignments of the visual features and thus allows us to train with unpaired, multimodal inputs. We extensively evaluated our method on two public multimodal benchmark datasets and outperform state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for cross-modality medical image segmentation has shown great progress by domain-invariant feature learning or image appearance translation. Adapted feature learning usually cannot detect domain shifts at the pixel level and is not able to achieve good results in dense semantic segmentation tasks. Image appearance translation, e.g. CycleGAN, translates images into different styles with good appearance, despite its population, its semantic consistency is hardly to maintain and results in poor cross-modality segmentation. In this paper, we propose intra- and cross-modality semantic consistency (ICMSC) for UDA and our key insight is that the segmentation of synthesised images in different styles should be consistent. Specifically, our model consists of an image translation module and a domain-specific segmentation module. The image translation module is a standard CycleGAN, while the segmentation module contains two domain-specific segmentation networks. The intra-modality semantic consistency (IMSC) forces the reconstructed image after a cycle to be segmented in the same way as the original input image, while the cross-modality semantic consistency (CMSC) encourages the synthesized images after translation to be segmented exactly the same as before translation. Comprehensive experimental results on cross-modality hip joint bone segmentation show the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves an average DICE of 81.61% on the acetabulum and 88.16% on the proximal femur, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. It is worth to note that without UDA, a model trained on CT for hip joint bone segmentation is non-transferable to MRI and has almost zero-DICE segmentation.\n",

      "Segmentation of organs of interest in 3D medical images is necessary for accurate diagnosis and longitudinal studies. Though recent advances using deep learning have shown success for many segmentation tasks, large datasets are required for high performance and the annotation process is both time consuming and labor intensive. In this paper, we propose a 3D few shot segmentation framework for accurate organ segmentation using limited training samples of the target organ annotation. To achieve this, a U-Net like network is designed to predict segmentation by learning the relationship between 2D slices of support data and a query image, including a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) that learns consistency of encoded features between adjacent slices. Also, we introduce a transfer learning method to adapt the characteristics of the target image and organ by updating the model before testing with arbitrary support and query data sampled from the support data. We evaluate our proposed model using three 3D CT datasets with annotations of different organs. Our model yielded significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art few shot segmentation models and was comparable to a fully supervised model trained with more target training data.\n",

A subsequent fully connected layer for classification was trained on the augmented TrashNet dataset [1]. In the application, sliding-window is used for image segmentation in the pre-classification stage. In the post-classification stage, the labelled sample points are integrated with Gaussian Clustering to locate the object.

      "In some complicated datasets, due to the presence of noisy data points and outliers, cluster validity indices can give conflicting results in determining the optimal number of clusters. This paper presents a new validity index for fuzzy-possibilistic c-means clustering called Fuzzy-Possibilistic (FP) index, which works well in the presence of clusters that vary in shape and density. Moreover, FPCM like most of the clustering algorithms is susceptible to some initial parameters. In this regard, in addition to the number of clusters, FPCM requires a priori selection of the degree of fuzziness and the degree of typicality. Therefore, we presented an efficient procedure for determining their optimal values. The proposed approach has been evaluated using several synthetic and real-world datasets. Final computational results demonstrate the capabilities and reliability of the proposed approach compared with several well-known fuzzy validity indices in the literature. Furthermore, to clarify the ability of the proposed method in real applications, the proposed method is implemented in microarray gene expression data clustering and medical image segmentation.\n",
      "Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image segmentation. The model cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the class imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for coarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this method leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation among the models. To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model, i.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better than MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net integrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists of shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific parameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively optimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design both an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based training strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between tasks and design a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses based on the category-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing method is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most impressively, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the BraTS 2015 testing set and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed approaches, we also won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating teams. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/chenhong-zhou/OM-Net.\n",
      "We introduce a novel Deep Learning framework, which quantitatively estimates image segmentation quality without the need for human inspection or labeling. We refer to this method as a Quality Assurance Network -- QANet. Specifically, given an image and a `proposed' corresponding segmentation, obtained by any method including manual annotation, the QANet solves a regression problem in order to estimate a predefined quality measure with respect to the unknown ground truth. The QANet is by no means yet another segmentation method. Instead, it performs a multi-level, multi-feature comparison of an image-segmentation pair based on a unique network architecture, called the RibCage.   To demonstrate the strength of the QANet, we addressed the evaluation of instance segmentation using two different datasets from different domains, namely, high throughput live cell microscopy images from the Cell Segmentation Benchmark and natural images of plants from the Leaf Segmentation Challenge. While synthesized segmentations were used to train the QANet, it was tested on segmentations obtained by publicly available methods that participated in the different challenges. We show that the QANet accurately estimates the scores of the evaluated segmentations with respect to the hidden ground truth, as published by the challenges' organizers.   The code is available at: TBD.\n",
      "While accelerators such as GPUs have limited memory, deep neural networks are becoming larger and will not fit with the memory limitation of accelerators for training. We propose an approach to tackle this problem by rewriting the computational graph of a neural network, in which swap-out and swap-in operations are inserted to temporarily store intermediate results on CPU memory. In particular, we first revise the concept of a computational graph by defining a concrete semantics for variables in a graph. We then formally show how to derive swap-out and swap-in operations from an existing graph and present rules to optimize the graph. To realize our approach, we developed a module in TensorFlow, named TFLMS. TFLMS is published as a pull request in the TensorFlow repository for contributing to the TensorFlow community. With TFLMS, we were able to train ResNet-50 and 3DUnet with 4.7x and 2x larger batch size, respectively. In particular, we were able to train 3DUNet using images of size of $192^3$ for image segmentation, which, without TFLMS, had been done only by dividing the images to smaller images, which affects the accuracy.\n",
      "This work proposes the use of Bayesian approximations of uncertainty from deep learning in a robot planner, showing that this produces more cautious actions in safety-critical scenarios. The case study investigated is motivated by a setup where an aerial robot acts as a \"scout\" for a ground robot. This is useful when the below area is unknown or dangerous, with applications in space exploration, military, or search-and-rescue. Images taken from the aerial view are used to provide a less obstructed map to guide the navigation of the robot on the ground. Experiments are conducted using a deep learning semantic image segmentation, followed by a path planner based on the resulting cost map, to provide an empirical analysis of the proposed method. A comparison with similar approaches is presented to portray the usefulness of certain techniques, or variations within a technique, in similar experimental settings. The method is analyzed to assess the impact of variations in the uncertainty extraction, as well as the absence of an uncertainty metric, on the overall system with the use of a defined metric which measures surprise to the planner. The analysis is performed on multiple datasets, showing a similar trend of lower surprise when uncertainty information is incorporated in the planning, given threshold values of the hyperparameters in the uncertainty extraction have been met. We find that taking uncertainty into account leads to paths that could be 18% less risky on an average.\n",
      "Deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation. However, most approaches have focused on learning image intensity features for segmentation, whereas the incorporation of anatomical shape priors has received less attention. In this paper, we combine a multi-task deep learning approach with atlas propagation to develop a shape-constrained bi-ventricular segmentation pipeline for short-axis CMR volumetric images. The pipeline first employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) that learns segmentation and landmark localisation tasks simultaneously. The architecture of the proposed FCN uses a 2.5D representation, thus combining the computational advantage of 2D FCNs networks and the capability of addressing 3D spatial consistency without compromising segmentation accuracy. Moreover, the refinement step is designed to explicitly enforce a shape constraint and improve segmentation quality. This step is effective for overcoming image artefacts (e.g. due to different breath-hold positions and large slice thickness), which preclude the creation of anatomically meaningful 3D cardiac shapes. The proposed pipeline is fully automated, due to network's ability to infer landmarks, which are then used downstream in the pipeline to initialise atlas propagation. We validate the pipeline on 1831 healthy subjects and 649 subjects with pulmonary hypertension. Extensive numerical experiments on the two datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is robust and capable of producing accurate, high-resolution and anatomically smooth bi-ventricular 3D models, despite the artefacts in input CMR volumes.\n",
      "Most of the semantic segmentation approaches have been developed for single image segmentation, and hence, video sequences are currently segmented by processing each frame of the video sequence separately. The disadvantage of this is that temporal image information is not considered, which improves the performance of the segmentation approach. One possibility to include temporal information is to use recurrent neural networks. However, there are only a few approaches using recurrent networks for video segmentation so far. These approaches extend the encoder-decoder network architecture of well-known segmentation approaches and place convolutional LSTM layers between encoder and decoder. However, in this paper it is shown that this position is not optimal, and that other positions in the network exhibit better performance. Nowadays, state-of-the-art segmentation approaches rarely use the classical encoder-decoder structure, but use multi-branch architectures. These architectures are more complex, and hence, it is more difficult to place the recurrent units at a proper position. In this work, the multi-branch architectures are extended by convolutional LSTM layers at different positions and evaluated on two different datasets in order to find the best one. It turned out that the proposed approach outperforms the pure CNN-based approach for up to 1.6 percent.\n",
      "X-Ray image enhancement, along with many other medical image processing applications, requires the segmentation of images into bone, soft tissue, and open beam regions. We apply a machine learning approach to this problem, presenting an end-to-end solution which results in robust and efficient inference. Since medical institutions frequently do not have the resources to process and label the large quantity of X-Ray images usually needed for neural network training, we design an end-to-end solution for small datasets, while achieving state-of-the-art results. Our implementation produces an overall accuracy of 92%, F1 score of 0.92, and an AUC of 0.98, surpassing classical image processing techniques, such as clustering and entropy based methods, while improving upon the output of existing neural networks used for segmentation in non-medical contexts. The code used for this project is available online.\n",
      "We propose a method to classify cardiac pathology based on a novel approach to extract image derived features to characterize the shape and motion of the heart. An original semi-supervised learning procedure, which makes efficient use of a large amount of non-segmented images and a small amount of images segmented manually by experts, is developed to generate pixel-wise apparent flow between two time points of a 2D+t cine MRI image sequence. Combining the apparent flow maps and cardiac segmentation masks, we obtain a local apparent flow corresponding to the 2D motion of myocardium and ventricular cavities. This leads to the generation of time series of the radius and thickness of myocardial segments to represent cardiac motion. These time series of motion features are reliable and explainable characteristics of pathological cardiac motion. Furthermore, they are combined with shape-related features to classify cardiac pathologies. Using only nine feature values as input, we propose an explainable, simple and flexible model for pathology classification. On ACDC training set and testing set, the model achieves 95% and 94% respectively as classification accuracy. Its performance is hence comparable to that of the state-of-the-art. Comparison with various other models is performed to outline some advantages of our model.\n",
      "Supervised training a deep neural network aims to \"teach\" the network to mimic human visual perception that is represented by image-and-label pairs in the training data. Superpixelized (SP) images are visually perceivable to humans, but a conventionally trained deep learning model often performs poorly when working on SP images. To better mimic human visual perception, we think it is desirable for the deep learning model to be able to perceive not only raw images but also SP images. In this paper, we propose a new superpixel-based data augmentation (SPDA) method for training deep learning models for biomedical image segmentation. Our method applies a superpixel generation scheme to all the original training images to generate superpixelized images. The SP images thus obtained are then jointly used with the original training images to train a deep learning model. Our experiments of SPDA on four biomedical image datasets show that SPDA is effective and can consistently improve the performance of state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation in 2D and 3D images. Additional studies also demonstrate that SPDA can practically reduce the generalization gap.\n",
      "A class of vision problems, less commonly studied, consists of detecting objects in imagery obtained from physics-based experiments. These objects can span in 4D (x, y, z, t) and are visible as disturbances (caused due to physical phenomena) in the image with background distribution being approximately uniform. Such objects, occasionally referred to as `events', can be considered as high energy blobs in the image. Unlike the images analyzed in conventional vision problems, very limited features are associated with such events, and their shape, size and count can vary significantly. This poses a challenge on the use of pre-trained models obtained from supervised approaches.   In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach involving iterative clustering based segmentation (ICS) which can detect target objects (events) in real-time. In this approach, a test image is analyzed over several cycles, and one event is identified per cycle. Each cycle consists of the following steps: (1) image segmentation using a modified k-means clustering method, (2) elimination of empty (with no events) segments based on statistical analysis of each segment, (3) merging segments that overlap (correspond to same event), and (4) selecting the strongest event. These four steps are repeated until all the events have been identified. The ICS approach consists of a few hyper-parameters that have been chosen based on statistical study performed over a set of test images. The applicability of ICS method is demonstrated on several 2D and 3D test examples.\n",
      "Optimal decision making with limited or no information in stochastic environments where multiple agents interact is a challenging topic in the realm of artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular approach for arriving at optimal strategies by predicating stimuli, such as the reward for following a strategy, on experience. RL is heavily explored in the single-agent context, but is a nascent concept in multiagent problems. To this end, I propose several principled model-free and partially model-based reinforcement learning approaches for several multiagent settings. In the realm of normative reinforcement learning, I introduce scalable extensions to Monte Carlo exploring starts for partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP), dubbed MCES-P, where I expand the theory and algorithm to the multiagent setting. I first examine MCES-P with probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds in the context of multiagent setting, showing MCESP+PAC holds in the presence of other agents. I then propose a more sample-efficient methodology for antagonistic settings, MCESIP+PAC. For cooperative settings, I extend MCES-P to the Multiagent POMDP, dubbed MCESMP+PAC. I then explore the use of reinforcement learning as a methodology in searching for optima in realistic and latent model environments. First, I explore a parameterized Q-learning approach in modeling humans learning to reason in an uncertain, multiagent environment. Next, I propose an implementation of MCES-P, along with image segmentation, to create an adaptive team-based reinforcement learning technique to positively identify the presence of phenotypically-expressed water and pathogen stress in crop fields.\n",
      "Segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is a fundamental step in many medical imaging-based applications. The recent implementation of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image processing has been shown to have significant impacts on medical image segmentation. Network training of segmentation CNNs typically requires images and paired annotation data representing pixel-wise tissue labels referred to as masks. However, the supervised training of highly efficient CNNs with deeper structure and more network parameters requires a large number of training images and paired tissue masks. Thus, there is great need to develop a generalized CNN-based segmentation method which would be applicable for a wide variety of MR image datasets with different tissue contrasts. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a generalized CNN-based method for fully-automated segmentation of different MR image datasets using a single set of annotated training data. A technique called cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) is applied as the core of the proposed method to perform image-to-image translation between MR image datasets with different tissue contrasts. A joint segmentation network is incorporated into the adversarial network to obtain additional segmentation functionality. The proposed method was evaluated for segmenting bone and cartilage on two clinical knee MR image datasets acquired at our institution using only a single set of annotated data from a publicly available knee MR image dataset. The new technique may further improve the applicability and efficiency of CNN-based segmentation of medical images while eliminating the need for large amounts of annotated training data.\n",
      "Learning long-term spatial-temporal features are critical for many video analysis tasks. However, existing video segmentation methods predominantly rely on static image segmentation techniques, and methods capturing temporal dependency for segmentation have to depend on pretrained optical flow models, leading to suboptimal solutions for the problem. End-to-end sequential learning to explore spatialtemporal features for video segmentation is largely limited by the scale of available video segmentation datasets, i.e., even the largest video segmentation dataset only contains 90 short video clips. To solve this problem, we build a new large-scale video object segmentation dataset called YouTube Video Object Segmentation dataset (YouTube-VOS). Our dataset contains 4,453 YouTube video clips and 94 object categories. This is by far the largest video object segmentation dataset to our knowledge and has been released at http://youtube-vos.org. We further evaluate several existing state-of-the-art video object segmentation algorithms on this dataset which aims to establish baselines for the development of new algorithms in the future.\n",
      "We develop three efficient approaches for generating visual explanations from 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for Alzheimer's disease classification. One approach conducts sensitivity analysis on hierarchical 3D image segmentation, and the other two visualize network activations on a spatial map. Visual checks and a quantitative localization benchmark indicate that all approaches identify important brain parts for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Comparative analysis show that the sensitivity analysis based approach has difficulty handling loosely distributed cerebral cortex, and approaches based on visualization of activations are constrained by the resolution of the convolutional layer. The complementarity of these methods improves the understanding of 3D-CNNs in Alzheimer's disease classification from different perspectives.\n",
      "We present a semi-parametric approach to photographic image synthesis from semantic layouts. The approach combines the complementary strengths of parametric and nonparametric techniques. The nonparametric component is a memory bank of image segments constructed from a training set of images. Given a novel semantic layout at test time, the memory bank is used to retrieve photographic references that are provided as source material to a deep network. The synthesis is performed by a deep network that draws on the provided photographic material. Experiments on multiple semantic segmentation datasets show that the presented approach yields considerably more realistic images than recent purely parametric techniques. The results are shown in the supplementary video at https://youtu.be/U4Q98lenGLQ\n",
      "Image segmentation needs both local boundary position information and global object context information. The performance of the recent state-of-the-art method, fully convolutional networks, reaches a bottleneck due to the neural network limit after balancing between the two types of information simultaneously in an end-to-end training style. To overcome this problem, we divide the semantic image segmentation into temporal subtasks. First, we find a possible pixel position of some object boundary; then trace the boundary at steps within a limited length until the whole object is outlined. We present the first deep reinforcement learning approach to semantic image segmentation, called DeepOutline, which outperforms other algorithms in Coco detection leaderboard in the middle and large size person category in Coco val2017 dataset. Meanwhile, it provides an insight into a divide and conquer way by reinforcement learning on computer vision problems.\n",
      "According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women. It is the second leading cause of death among women round the world, becoming the most fatal form of cancer. Mammographic image segmentation is a fundamental task to support image analysis and diagnosis, taking into account shape analysis of mammary lesions and their borders. However, mammogram segmentation is a very hard process, once it is highly dependent on the types of mammary tissues. In this work we present a new semi-supervised segmentation algorithm based on the modification of the GrowCut algorithm to perform automatic mammographic image segmentation once a region of interest is selected by a specialist. In our proposal, we used fuzzy Gaussian membership functions to modify the evolution rule of the original GrowCut algorithm, in order to estimate the uncertainty of a pixel being object or background. The main impact of the proposed method is the significant reduction of expert effort in the initialization of seed points of GrowCut to perform accurate segmentation, once it removes the need of selection of background seeds. We also constructed an automatic point selection process based on the simulated annealing optimization method, avoiding the need of human intervention. The proposed approach was qualitatively compared with other state-of-the-art segmentation techniques, considering the shape of segmented regions. In order to validate our proposal, we built an image classifier using a classical multilayer perceptron. We used Zernike moments to extract segmented image features. This analysis employed 685 mammograms from IRMA breast cancer database, using fat and fibroid tissues. Results show that the proposed technique could achieve a classification rate of 91.28\\% for fat tissues, evidencing the feasibility of our approach.\n",
      "Digital image segmentation is the process of assigning distinct labels to different objects in a digital image, and the fuzzy segmentation algorithm has been successfully used in the segmentation of images from a wide variety of sources. However, the traditional fuzzy segmentation algorithm fails to segment objects that are characterized by textures whose patterns cannot be successfully described by simple statistics computed over a very restricted area. In this paper, we propose an extension of the fuzzy segmentation algorithm that uses adaptive textural affinity functions to perform the segmentation of such objects on bidimensional images. The adaptive affinity functions compute their appropriate neighborhood size as they compute the texture descriptors surrounding the seed spels (spatial elements), according to the characteristics of the texture being processed. The algorithm then segments the image with an appropriate neighborhood for each object. We performed experiments on mosaic images that were composed using images from the Brodatz database, and compared our results with the ones produced by a recently published texture segmentation algorithm, showing the applicability of our method.\n",
      "For complex segmentation tasks, fully automatic systems are inherently limited in their achievable accuracy for extracting relevant objects. Especially in cases where only few data sets need to be processed for a highly accurate result, semi-automatic segmentation techniques exhibit a clear benefit for the user. One area of application is medical image processing during an intervention for a single patient. We propose a learning-based cooperative segmentation approach which includes the computing entity as well as the user into the task. Our system builds upon a state-of-the-art fully convolutional artificial neural network (FCN) as well as an active user model for training. During the segmentation process, a user of the trained system can iteratively add additional hints in form of pictorial scribbles as seed points into the FCN system to achieve an interactive and precise segmentation result. The segmentation quality of interactive FCNs is evaluated. Iterative FCN approaches can yield superior results compared to networks without the user input channel component, due to a consistent improvement in segmentation quality after each interaction.\n",
      "We approach structured output prediction by optimizing a deep value network (DVN) to precisely estimate the task loss on different output configurations for a given input. Once the model is trained, we perform inference by gradient descent on the continuous relaxations of the output variables to find outputs with promising scores from the value network. When applied to image segmentation, the value network takes an image and a segmentation mask as inputs and predicts a scalar estimating the intersection over union between the input and ground truth masks. For multi-label classification, the DVN's objective is to correctly predict the F1 score for any potential label configuration. The DVN framework achieves the state-of-the-art results on multi-label prediction and image segmentation benchmarks.\n",
      "This manuscript introduces the problem of prominent object detection and recognition inspired by the fact that human seems to priorities perception of scene elements. The problem deals with finding the most important region of interest, segmenting the relevant item/object in that area, and assigning it an object class label. In other words, we are solving the three problems of saliency modeling, saliency detection, and object recognition under one umbrella. The motivation behind such a problem formulation is (1) the benefits to the knowledge representation-based vision pipelines, and (2) the potential improvements in emulating bio-inspired vision systems by solving these three problems together. We are foreseeing extending this problem formulation to fully semantically segmented scenes with instance object priority for high-level inferences in various applications including assistive vision. Along with a new problem definition, we also propose a method to achieve such a task. The proposed model predicts the most important area in the image, segments the associated objects, and labels them. The proposed problem and method are evaluated against human fixations, annotated segmentation masks, and object class categories. We define a chance level for each of the evaluation criterion to compare the proposed algorithm with. Despite the good performance of the proposed baseline, the overall evaluations indicate that the problem of prominent object detection and recognition is a challenging task that is still worth investigating further.\n",
      "While deep learning is remarkably successful on perceptual tasks, it was also shown to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of the input. These perturbations denote noise added to the input that was generated specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible for humans. More severely, there even exist universal perturbations that are input-agnostic but fool the network on the majority of inputs. While recent work has focused on image classification, this work proposes attacks against semantic image segmentation: we present an approach for generating (universal) adversarial perturbations that make the network yield a desired target segmentation as output. We show empirically that there exist barely perceptible universal noise patterns which result in nearly the same predicted segmentation for arbitrary inputs. Furthermore, we also show the existence of universal noise which removes a target class (e.g., all pedestrians) from the segmentation while leaving the segmentation mostly unchanged otherwise.\n",
      "Convolutional Neural Networks have been highly successful in performing a host of computer vision tasks such as object recognition, object detection, image segmentation and texture synthesis. In 2015, Gatys et. al [7] show how the style of a painter can be extracted from an image of the painting and applied to another normal photograph, thus recreating the photo in the style of the painter. The method has been successfully applied to a wide range of images and has since spawned multiple applications and mobile apps. In this paper, the neural style transfer algorithm is applied to fashion so as to synthesize new custom clothes. We construct an approach to personalize and generate new custom clothes based on a users preference and by learning the users fashion choices from a limited set of clothes from their closet. The approach is evaluated by analyzing the generated images of clothes and how well they align with the users fashion style.\n",
      "Image segmentation has many applications which range from machine learning to medical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a framework for the segmentation of images based on super-pixels and algorithms for community identification in graphs. The super-pixel pre-segmentation step reduces the number of nodes in the graph, rendering the method the ability to process large images. Moreover, community detection algorithms provide more accurate segmentation than traditional approaches, such as those based on spectral graph partition. We also compare our method with two algorithms: a) the graph-based approach by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher and b) the contour-based method by Arbelaez. Results have shown that our method provides more precise segmentation and is faster than both of them.\n",
      "This study introduced a novel system, called Gaze2Segment, integrating biological and computer vision techniques to support radiologists' reading experience with an automatic image segmentation task. During diagnostic assessment of lung CT scans, the radiologists' gaze information were used to create a visual attention map. This map was then combined with a computer-derived saliency map, extracted from the gray-scale CT images. The visual attention map was used as an input for indicating roughly the location of a object of interest. With computer-derived saliency information, on the other hand, we aimed at finding foreground and background cues for the object of interest. At the final step, these cues were used to initiate a seed-based delineation process. Segmentation accuracy of the proposed Gaze2Segment was found to be 86% with dice similarity coefficient and 1.45 mm with Hausdorff distance. To the best of our knowledge, Gaze2Segment is the first true integration of eye-tracking technology into a medical image segmentation task without the need for any further user-interaction.\n",
      "Recently there has been an increasing trend to use deep learning frameworks for both 2D consumer images and for 3D medical images. However, there has been little effort to use deep frameworks for volumetric vascular segmentation. We wanted to address this by providing a freely available dataset of 12 annotated two-photon vasculature microscopy stacks. We demonstrated the use of deep learning framework consisting both 2D and 3D convolutional filters (ConvNet). Our hybrid 2D-3D architecture produced promising segmentation result. We derived the architectures from Lee et al. who used the ZNN framework initially designed for electron microscope image segmentation. We hope that by sharing our volumetric vasculature datasets, we will inspire other researchers to experiment with vasculature dataset and improve the used network architectures.\n",

In our work, we propose to use neural networks and visual semantic embeddings, without intermediate stages such as object detection and image segmentation, to predict answers to simple questions about images. Our model performs 1.8 times better than the only published results on an existing image QA dataset. We also present a question generation algorithm that converts image descriptions, which are widely available, into QA form. We used this algorithm to produce an order-of-magnitude larger dataset, with more evenly distributed answers. A suite of baseline results on this new dataset are also presented.\n",
      "Recent works have highlighted scale invariance or symmetry that is present in the weight space of a typical deep network and the adverse effect that it has on the Euclidean gradient based stochastic gradient descent optimization. In this work, we show that these and other commonly used deep networks, such as those which use a max-pooling and sub-sampling layer, possess more complex forms of symmetry arising from scaling based reparameterization of the network weights. We then propose two symmetry-invariant gradient based weight updates for stochastic gradient descent based learning. Our empirical evidence based on the MNIST dataset shows that these updates improve the test performance without sacrificing the computational efficiency of the weight updates. We also show the results of training with one of the proposed weight updates on an image segmentation problem.\n",

We found that a slightly unconventional \"stacked 2D\" approach provides much better classification performance than simple 2D patches without requiring significantly more computational power. We also examined the popular \"tri-planar\" approach used in some recently published studies, and found that it provides much better results than the 2D approaches, but also with a moderate increase in computational power requirement. Finally, we evaluated a full 3D convolutional architecture, and found that it provides marginally better results than the tri-planar approach, but at the cost of a very significant increase in computational power requirement.\n",

Connected component analysis and gridding technique enhance the correctness of the results. The proposed method reaches 98.5% accuracy level on the basis of experimental data sets.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for inferring the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) solution of discrete pairwise random field models under multiple constraints. We show how this constrained discrete optimization problem can be formulated as a multi-dimensional parametric mincut problem via its Lagrangian dual, and prove that our algorithm isolates all constraint instances for which the problem can be solved exactly. These multiple solutions enable us to even deal with `soft constraints' (higher order penalty functions). Moreover, we propose two practical variants of our algorithm to solve problems with hard constraints. We also show how our method can be applied to solve various constrained discrete optimization problems such as submodular minimization and shortest path computation. Experimental evaluation using the foreground-background image segmentation problem with statistic constraints reveals that our method is faster and its results are closer to the ground truth labellings compared with the popular continuous relaxation based methods.\n",
      "\"Background subtraction\" is an old technique for finding moving objects in a video sequence for example, cars driving on a freeway. The idea is that subtracting the current image from a timeaveraged background image will leave only nonstationary objects. It is, however, a crude approximation to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a mixture-of-Gaussians classification model for each pixel using an unsupervised technique- an efficient, incremental version of EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this automatically updates the mixture component for each class according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other techniques such as thresholding. Application of this method as part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is expected to result in significant improvements in vehicle identification and tracking.\n",
      "Detection and segmentation of Brain tumor is very important because it provides anatomical information of normal and abnormal tissues which helps in treatment planning and patient follow-up.

ANFIS includes benefits of both ANN and the fuzzy logic systems. A comprehensive feature set and fuzzy rules are selected to classify an abnormal image to the corresponding tumor type. Experimental results illustrate promising results in terms of classification accuracy. A comparative analysis is performed with the FCM and K-NN to show the superior nature of ANFIS systems.\n",
      "Most state-of-the-art techniques for multi-class image segmentation and labeling use conditional random fields defined over pixels or image regions. While region-level models often feature dense pairwise connectivity, pixel-level models are considerably larger and have only permitted sparse graph structures. In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models defined on the complete set of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that dense connectivity at the pixel level substantially improves segmentation and labeling accuracy.\n",
      "Fuzzy systems concern fundamental methodology to represent and process uncertainty and imprecision in the linguistic information. The fuzzy systems that use fuzzy rules to represent the domain knowledge of the problem are known as Fuzzy Rule Base Systems (FRBS).

Experimental results suggest that this approach is an efficient one in comparison to different other techniques extensively addressed in literature.

      "In the recent advancement of multimedia technologies, it becomes a major concern of detecting visual attention regions in the field of image processing. The popularity of the terminal devices in a heterogeneous environment of the multimedia technology gives us enough scope for the betterment of image visualization. Although there exist numerous methods, feature based image extraction becomes a popular one in the field of image processing. The objective of image segmentation is the domain-independent partition of the image into a set of regions, which are visually distinct and uniform with respect to some property, such as grey level, texture or colour. Segmentation and subsequent extraction can be considered the first step and key issue in object recognition, scene understanding and image analysis. Its application area encompasses mobile devices, industrial quality control, medical appliances, robot navigation, geophysical exploration, military applications, etc. In all these areas, the quality of the final results depends largely on the quality of the preprocessing work. Most of the times, acquiring spurious-free preprocessing data requires a lot of application cum mathematical intensive background works.

      "We present the first method to handle curvature regularity in region-based image segmentation and inpainting that is independent of initialization.   To this end we start from a new formulation of length-based optimization schemes, based on surface continuation constraints, and discuss the connections to existing schemes. The formulation is based on a \\emph{cell complex} and considers basic regions and boundary elements. The corresponding optimization problem is cast as an integer linear program.   We then show how the method can be extended to include curvature regularity, again cast as an integer linear program. Here, we are considering pairs of boundary elements to reflect curvature. Moreover, a constraint set is derived to ensure that the boundary variables indeed reflect the boundary of the regions described by the region variables.   We show that by solving the linear programming relaxation one gets quite close to the global optimum, and that curvature regularity is indeed much better suited in the presence of long and thin objects compared to standard length regularity.\n",
      "Images can be segmented by first using a classifier to predict an affinity graph that reflects the degree to which image pixels must be grouped together and then partitioning the graph to yield a segmentation. Machine learning has been applied to the affinity classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassification rates. However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the affinity graph. We present the first machine learning algorithm for training a classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classification of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of finding the connected components of the thresholded affinity graph, we are able to train an affinity classifier to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning. Our learning algorithm corresponds to the learning of maximin affinities between image pixel pairs, which are predictive of the pixel-pair connectivity.\n",
      "We present results from the first geological field tests of the `Cyborg Astrobiologist', which is a wearable computer and video camcorder system that we are using to test and train a computer-vision system towards having some of the autonomous decision-making capabilities of a field-geologist. The Cyborg Astrobiologist platform has thus far been used for testing and development of these algorithms and systems: robotic acquisition of quasi-mosaics of images, real-time image segmentation, and real-time determination of interesting points in the image mosaics. This work is more of a test of the whole system, rather than of any one part of the system. However, beyond the concept of the system itself, the uncommon map (despite its simplicity) is the main innovative part of the system. The uncommon map helps to determine interest-points in a context-free manner. Overall, the hardware and software systems function reliably, and the computer-vision algorithms are adequate for the first field tests. In addition to the proof-of-concept aspect of these field tests, the main result of these field tests is the enumeration of those issues that we can improve in the future, including: dealing with structural shadow and microtexture, and also, controlling the camera's zoom lens in an intelligent manner. Nonetheless, despite these and other technical inadequacies, this Cyborg Astrobiologist system, consisting of a camera-equipped wearable-computer and its computer-vision algorithms, has demonstrated its ability of finding genuinely interesting points in real-time in the geological scenery, and then gathering more information about these interest points in an automated manner. We use these capabilities for autonomous guidance towards geological points-of-interest.\n",

      "Vision-language pre-training has recently emerged as a promising alternative for representation learning. It shifts from the tradition of using images and discrete labels for learning a fixed set of weights, seen as visual concepts, to aligning images and raw text for two separate encoders. Such a paradigm benefits from a broader source of supervision and allows zero-shot transfer to downstream tasks since visual concepts can be diametrically generated from natural language, known as prompt. In this paper, we identify that a major challenge of deploying such models in practice is prompt engineering. This is because designing a proper prompt, especially for context words surrounding a class name, requires domain expertise and typically takes a significant amount of time for words tuning since a slight change in wording could have a huge impact on performance. Moreover, different downstream tasks require specific designs, further hampering the efficiency of deployment. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach named context optimization (CoOp). The main idea is to model context in prompts using continuous representations and perform end-to-end learning from data while keeping the pre-trained parameters fixed. In this way, the design of task-relevant prompts can be fully automated. Experiments on 11 datasets show that CoOp effectively turns pre-trained vision-language models into data-efficient visual learners, requiring as few as one or two shots to beat hand-crafted prompts with a decent margin and able to gain significant improvements when using more shots (e.g., at 16 shots the average gain is around 17% with the highest reaching over 50%). CoOp also exhibits strong robustness to distribution shift.\n",
      "Face parsing infers a pixel-wise label to each facial component, which has drawn much attention recently. Previous methods have shown their success in face parsing, which however overlook the correlation among facial components. As a matter of fact, the component-wise relationship is a critical clue in discriminating ambiguous pixels in facial area. To address this issue, we propose adaptive graph representation learning and reasoning over facial components, aiming to learn representative vertices that describe each component, exploit the component-wise relationship and thereby produce accurate parsing results against ambiguity. In particular, we devise an adaptive and differentiable graph abstraction method to represent the components on a graph via pixel-to-vertex projection under the initial condition of a predicted parsing map, where pixel features within a certain facial region are aggregated onto a vertex. Further, we explicitly incorporate the image edge as a prior in the model, which helps to discriminate edge and non-edge pixels during the projection, thus leading to refined parsing results along the edges. Then, our model learns and reasons over the relations among components by propagating information across vertices on the graph. Finally, the refined vertex features are projected back to pixel grids for the prediction of the final parsing map. To train our model, we propose a discriminative loss to penalize small distances between vertices in the feature space, which leads to distinct vertices with strong semantics. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model on multiple face parsing datasets, along with the validation on the human parsing task to demonstrate the generalizability of our model.\n",
      "Recent years have seen a rise in the development of representational learning methods for graph data. Most of these methods, however, focus on node-level representation learning at various scales (e.g., microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic node embedding). In comparison, methods for representation learning on whole graphs are currently relatively sparse. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised whole graph embedding method. Our method uses spectral graph wavelets to capture topological similarities on each k-hop sub-graph between nodes and uses them to learn embeddings for the whole graph. We evaluate our method against 12 well-known baselines on 4 real-world datasets and show that our method achieves the best performance across all experiments, outperforming the current state-of-the-art by a considerable margin.\n",
      "3D object detection and dense depth estimation are one of the most vital tasks in autonomous driving. Multiple sensor modalities can jointly attribute towards better robot perception, and to that end, we introduce a method for jointly training 3D object detection and monocular dense depth reconstruction neural networks. It takes as inputs, a LiDAR point-cloud, and a single RGB image during inference and produces object pose predictions as well as a densely reconstructed depth map. LiDAR point-cloud is converted into a set of voxels, and its features are extracted using 3D convolution layers, from which we regress object pose parameters. Corresponding RGB image features are extracted using another 2D convolutional neural network. We further use these combined features to predict a dense depth map. While our object detection is trained in a supervised manner, the depth prediction network is trained with both self-supervised and supervised loss functions. We also introduce a loss function, edge-preserving smooth loss, and show that this results in better depth estimation compared to the edge-aware smooth loss function, frequently used in depth prediction works.\n",
      "Real-world information networks are increasingly occurring across various disciplines including online social networks and citation networks. These network data are generally characterized by sparseness, nonlinearity and heterogeneity bringing different challenges to the network analytics task to capture inherent properties from network data. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been recently leveraged as powerful systems to learn insights from network data and deal with presented challenges. As part of machine learning techniques, graph embedding approaches are originally conceived for graphs constructed from feature represented datasets, like image dataset, in which links between nodes are explicitly defined. These traditional approaches cannot cope with network data challenges. As a new learning paradigm, network representation learning has been proposed to map a real-world information network into a low-dimensional space while preserving inherent properties of the network. In this paper, we present a systematic comprehensive survey of network representation learning, known also as network embedding, from birth to the current development state. Through the undertaken survey, we provide a comprehensive view of reasons behind the emergence of network embedding and, types of settings and models used in the network embedding pipeline. Thus, we introduce a brief history of representation learning and word representation learning ancestor of network embedding. We provide also formal definitions of basic concepts required to understand network representation learning followed by a description of network embedding pipeline. Most commonly used downstream tasks to evaluate embeddings, their evaluation metrics and popular datasets are highlighted. Finally, we present the open-source libraries for network embedding.\n",
      "We extract and use player position time-series data, tagged along with the action types, to build a competent model for representing team tactics behavioral patterns and use this representation to predict the outcome of arbitrary movements. We provide a framework for the useful encoding of short tactics and space occupations in a more extended sequence of movements or tactical plans. We investigate game segments during a match in which the team in possession of the ball regularly attempts to reach a position where they can take a shot at goal for a single game. A carefully designed and efficient kernel is employed using a triangular fuzzy membership function to create multiple time series for players' potential of presence at different court regions. Unsupervised learning is then used for time series using triplet loss and deep neural networks with exponentially dilated causal convolutions for the derived multivariate time series. This works key contribution lies in its approach to model how short scenes contribute to other longer ones and how players occupies and creates new spaces in-game court. We discuss the effectiveness of the proposed approach for prediction and recognition tasks on the professional basketball SportVU dataset for the 2015-16 half-season. The proposed system demonstrates descent functionality even with relatively small data.\n",
      "Understanding what sequence of steps are needed to complete a goal can help artificial intelligence systems reason about human activities. Past work in NLP has examined the task of goal-step inference for text. We introduce the visual analogue. We propose the Visual Goal-Step Inference (VGSI) task, where a model is given a textual goal and must choose which of four images represents a plausible step towards that goal. With a new dataset harvested from wikiHow consisting of 772,277 images representing human actions, we show that our task is challenging for state-of-the-art multimodal models. Moreover, the multimodal representation learned from our data can be effectively transferred to other datasets like HowTo100m, increasing the VGSI accuracy by 15 - 20%. Our task will facilitate multimodal reasoning about procedural events.\n",
      "A wide range of machine learning applications such as privacy-preserving learning, algorithmic fairness, and domain adaptation/generalization among others, involve learning \\emph{invariant representations} of the data that aim to achieve two competing goals: (a) maximize information or accuracy with respect to a target response, and (b) maximize invariance or independence with respect to a set of protected features (e.g.\\ for fairness, privacy, etc). Despite their wide applicability, theoretical understanding of the optimal tradeoffs -- with respect to accuracy, and invariance -- achievable by invariant representations is still severely lacking. In this paper, we provide precisely such an information-theoretic analysis of such tradeoffs under both classification and regression settings. We provide a geometric characterization of the accuracy and invariance achievable by any representation of the data; we term this feasible region the information plane. We provide a lower bound for this feasible region for the classification case, and an exact characterization for the regression case, which allows us to either bound or exactly characterize the Pareto optimal frontier between accuracy and invariance. Although our contributions are mainly theoretical, a key practical application of our results is in certifying the potential sub-optimality of any given representation learning algorithm for either classification or regression tasks. Our results shed new light on the fundamental interplay between accuracy and invariance, and may be useful in guiding the design of future representation learning algorithms.\n",
      "We present a novel learning-based approach to graph representations of road networks employing state-of-the-art graph convolutional neural networks. Our approach is applied to realistic road networks of 17 cities from Open Street Map. While edge features are crucial to generate descriptive graph representations of road networks, graph convolutional networks usually rely on node features only. We show that the highly representative edge features can still be integrated into such networks by applying a line graph transformation. We also propose a method for neighborhood sampling based on a topological neighborhood composed of both local and global neighbors. We compare the performance of learning representations using different types of neighborhood aggregation functions in transductive and inductive tasks and in supervised and unsupervised learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel aggregation approach, Graph Attention Isomorphism Network, GAIN. Our results show that GAIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the road type classification problem.\n",
      "Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has become essential for modern graph data mining and learning tasks. GRL aims to capture the graph's structural information and exploit it in combination with node and edge attributes to compute low-dimensional representations. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been used in state-of-the-art GRL architectures, they have been shown to suffer from over smoothing when many GNN layers need to be stacked. In a different GRL approach, spectral methods based on graph filtering have emerged addressing over smoothing; however, up to now, they employ traditional neural networks that cannot efficiently exploit the structure of graph data. Motivated by this, we propose PointSpectrum, a spectral method that incorporates a set equivariant network to account for a graph's structure. PointSpectrum enhances the efficiency and expressiveness of spectral methods, while it outperforms or competes with state-of-the-art GRL methods. Overall, PointSpectrum addresses over smoothing by employing a graph filter and captures a graph's structure through set equivariance, lying on the intersection of GNNs and spectral methods. Our findings are promising for the benefits and applicability of this architectural shift for spectral methods and GRL.\n",
      "Multi-view representation learning captures comprehensive information from multiple views of a shared context. Recent works intuitively apply contrastive learning (CL) to learn representations, regarded as a pairwise manner, which is still scalable: view-specific noise is not filtered in learning view-shared representations; the fake negative pairs, where the negative terms are actually within the same class as the positive, and the real negative pairs are coequally treated; and evenly measuring the similarities between terms might interfere with optimization. Importantly, few works research the theoretical framework of generalized self-supervised multi-view learning, especially for more than two views. To this end, we rethink the existing multi-view learning paradigm from the information theoretical perspective and then propose a novel information theoretical framework for generalized multi-view learning. Guided by it, we build a multi-view coding method with a three-tier progressive architecture, namely Information theory-guided heuristic Progressive Multi-view Coding (IPMC). In the distribution-tier, IPMC aligns the distribution between views to reduce view-specific noise. In the set-tier, IPMC builds self-adjusted pools for contrasting, which utilizes a view filter to adaptively modify the pools. Lastly, in the instance-tier, we adopt a designed unified loss to learn discriminative representations and reduce the gradient interference. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of IPMC over state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Self-supervised learning provides an opportunity to explore unlabeled chest X-rays and their associated free-text reports accumulated in clinical routine without manual supervision. This paper proposes a Joint Image Text Representation Learning Network (JoImTeRNet) for pre-training on chest X-ray images and their radiology reports. The model was pre-trained on both the global image-sentence level and the local image region-word level for visual-textual matching. Both are bidirectionally constrained on Cross-Entropy based and ranking-based Triplet Matching Losses. The region-word matching is calculated using the attention mechanism without direct supervision about their mapping. The pre-trained multi-modal representation learning paves the way for downstream tasks concerning image and/or text encoding. We demonstrate the representation learning quality by cross-modality retrievals and multi-label classifications on two datasets: OpenI-IU and MIMIC-CXR\n",

The transformer-based models learn inter and intra-modal attention through a list of self-supervised learning tasks. This paper proposes LAViTeR, a novel architecture for visual and textual representation learning. The main module, Visual Textual Alignment (VTA) will be assisted by two auxiliary tasks, GAN-based image synthesis and Image Captioning. We also propose a new evaluation metric measuring the similarity between the learnt visual and textual embedding. The experimental results on two public datasets, CUB and MS-COCO, demonstrate superior visual and textual representation alignment in the joint feature embedding space\n",
      "Self-organization of complex morphological patterns from local interactions is a fascinating phenomenon in many natural and artificial systems. In the artificial world, typical examples of such morphogenetic systems are cellular automata. Yet, their mechanisms are often very hard to grasp and so far scientific discoveries of novel patterns have primarily been relying on manual tuning and ad hoc exploratory search. The problem of automated diversity-driven discovery in these systems was recently introduced [26, 62], highlighting that two key ingredients are autonomous exploration and unsupervised representation learning to describe \"relevant\" degrees of variations in the patterns. In this paper, we motivate the need for what we call Meta-diversity search, arguing that there is not a unique ground truth interesting diversity as it strongly depends on the final observer and its motives. Using a continuous game-of-life system for experiments, we provide empirical evidences that relying on monolithic architectures for the behavioral embedding design tends to bias the final discoveries (both for hand-defined and unsupervisedly-learned features) which are unlikely to be aligned with the interest of a final end-user. To address these issues, we introduce a novel dynamic and modular architecture that enables unsupervised learning of a hierarchy of diverse representations. Combined with intrinsically motivated goal exploration algorithms, we show that this system forms a discovery assistant that can efficiently adapt its diversity search towards preferences of a user using only a very small amount of user feedback.\n",
      "Most deep neural networks (DNNs) based ultrasound (US) medical image analysis models use pretrained backbones (e.g., ImageNet) for better model generalization. However, the domain gap between natural and medical images causes an inevitable performance bottleneck. To alleviate this problem, an US dataset named US-4 is constructed for direct pretraining on the same domain. It contains over 23,000 images from four US video sub-datasets. To learn robust features from US-4, we propose an US semi-supervised contrastive learning method, named USCL, for pretraining. In order to avoid high similarities between negative pairs as well as mine abundant visual features from limited US videos, USCL adopts a sample pair generation method to enrich the feature involved in a single step of contrastive optimization. Extensive experiments on several downstream tasks show the superiority of USCL pretraining against ImageNet pretraining and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) pretraining approaches. In particular, USCL pretrained backbone achieves fine-tuning accuracy of over 94% on POCUS dataset, which is 10% higher than 84% of the ImageNet pretrained model. The source codes of this work are available at https://github.com/983632847/USCL.\n",
      "We present a novel technique for self-supervised video representation learning by: (a) decoupling the learning objective into two contrastive subtasks respectively emphasizing spatial and temporal features, and (b) performing it hierarchically to encourage multi-scale understanding. Motivated by their effectiveness in supervised learning, we first introduce spatial-temporal feature learning decoupling and hierarchical learning to the context of unsupervised video learning. We show by experiments that augmentations can be manipulated as regularization to guide the network to learn desired semantics in contrastive learning, and we propose a way for the model to separately capture spatial and temporal features at multiple scales. We also introduce an approach to overcome the problem of divergent levels of instance invariance at different hierarchies by modeling the invariance as loss weights for objective re-weighting. Experiments on downstream action recognition benchmarks on UCF101 and HMDB51 show that our proposed Hierarchically Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Contrast (HDC) makes substantial improvements over directly learning spatial-temporal features as a whole and achieves competitive performance when compared with other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. Code will be made available.\n",
      "Graph representation learning has achieved great success in many areas, including e-commerce, chemistry, biology, etc. However, the fundamental problem of choosing the appropriate dimension of node embedding for a given graph still remains unsolved. The commonly used strategies for Node Embedding Dimension Selection (NEDS) based on grid search or empirical knowledge suffer from heavy computation and poor model performance. In this paper, we revisit NEDS from the perspective of minimum entropy principle. Subsequently, we propose a novel Minimum Graph Entropy (MinGE) algorithm for NEDS with graph data. To be specific, MinGE considers both feature entropy and structure entropy on graphs, which are carefully designed according to the characteristics of the rich information in them. The feature entropy, which assumes the embeddings of adjacent nodes to be more similar, connects node features and link topology on graphs. The structure entropy takes the normalized degree as basic unit to further measure the higher-order structure of graphs. Based on them, we design MinGE to directly calculate the ideal node embedding dimension for any graph. Finally, comprehensive experiments with popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed MinGE.\n",
      "Graph neural networks for heterogeneous graph embedding is to project nodes into a low-dimensional space by exploring the heterogeneity and semantics of the heterogeneous graph. However, on the one hand, most of existing heterogeneous graph embedding methods either insufficiently model the local structure under specific semantic, or neglect the heterogeneity when aggregating information from it. On the other hand, representations from multiple semantics are not comprehensively integrated to obtain versatile node embeddings. To address the problem, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Multi-View Representation Learning (named MV-HetGNN) for heterogeneous graph embedding by introducing the idea of multi-view representation learning. The proposed model consists of node feature transformation, view-specific ego graph encoding and auto multi-view fusion to thoroughly learn complex structural and semantic information for generating comprehensive node representations. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that the proposed MV-HetGNN model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines in various downstream tasks, e.g., node classification, node clustering, and link prediction.\n",
      "Self-supervised representation learning has achieved remarkable success in recent years. By subverting the need for supervised labels, such approaches are able to utilize the numerous unlabeled images that exist on the Internet and in photographic datasets. Yet to build truly intelligent agents, we must construct representation learning algorithms that can learn not only from datasets but also learn from environments. An agent in a natural environment will not typically be fed curated data. Instead, it must explore its environment to acquire the data it will learn from. We propose a framework, curious representation learning (CRL), which jointly learns a reinforcement learning policy and a visual representation model. The policy is trained to maximize the error of the representation learner, and in doing so is incentivized to explore its environment. At the same time, the learned representation becomes stronger and stronger as the policy feeds it ever harder data to learn from. Our learned representations enable promising transfer to downstream navigation tasks, performing better than or comparably to ImageNet pretraining without using any supervision at all. In addition, despite being trained in simulation, our learned representations can obtain interpretable results on real images. Code is available at https://yilundu.github.io/crl/.\n",
      "Node classification and link prediction are widely studied in graph representation learning. While both transductive node classification and link prediction operate over a single input graph, they have so far been studied separately. Node classification models take an input graph with node features and incomplete node labels, and implicitly assume that the graph is relationally complete, i.e., no edges are missing. By contrast, link prediction models are solely motivated by relational incompleteness of the input graphs, and do not typically leverage node features or classes. We propose a unifying perspective and study the problems of (i) transductive node classification over incomplete graphs and (ii) link prediction over graphs with node features, introduce a new dataset for this setting, WikiAlumni, and conduct an extensive benchmarking study.\n",
      "The abundance of data collected by sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the success of deep neural networks in uncovering hidden patterns in time series data have led to mounting privacy concerns. This is because private and sensitive information can be potentially learned from sensor data by applications that have access to this data. In this paper, we aim to examine the tradeoff between utility and privacy loss by learning low-dimensional representations that are useful for data obfuscation. We propose deterministic and probabilistic transformations in the latent space of a variational autoencoder to synthesize time series data such that intrusive inferences are prevented while desired inferences can still be made with sufficient accuracy. In the deterministic case, we use a linear transformation to move the representation of input data in the latent space such that the reconstructed data is likely to have the same public attribute but a different private attribute than the original input data. In the probabilistic case, we apply the linear transformation to the latent representation of input data with some probability. We compare our technique with autoencoder-based anonymization techniques and additionally show that it can anonymize data in real time on resource-constrained edge devices.\n",
      "Time series data can be subject to changes in the underlying process that generates them and, because of these changes, models built on old samples can become obsolete or perform poorly. In this work, we present a way to incorporate information about the current data distribution and its evolution across time into machine learning algorithms. Our solution is based on efficiently maintaining statistics, particularly the mean and the variance, of data features at different time resolutions. These data summarisations can be performed over the input attributes, in which case they can then be fed into the model as additional input features, or over latent representations learned by models, such as those of Recurrent Neural Networks. In classification tasks, the proposed techniques can significantly outperform the prediction capabilities of equivalent architectures with no feature / latent summarisations. Furthermore, these modifications do not introduce notable computational and memory overhead when properly adjusted.\n",
      "Travel-time prediction constitutes a task of high importance in transportation networks, with web mapping services like Google Maps regularly serving vast quantities of travel time queries from users and enterprises alike. Further, such a task requires accounting for complex spatiotemporal interactions (modelling both the topological properties of the road network and anticipating events -- such as rush hours -- that may occur in the future). Hence, it is an ideal target for graph representation learning at scale. Here we present a graph neural network estimator for estimated time of arrival (ETA) which we have deployed in production at Google Maps. While our main architecture consists of standard GNN building blocks, we further detail the usage of training schedule methods such as MetaGradients in order to make our model robust and production-ready. We also provide prescriptive studies: ablating on various architectural decisions and training regimes, and qualitative analyses on real-world situations where our model provides a competitive edge. Our GNN proved powerful when deployed, significantly reducing negative ETA outcomes in several regions compared to the previous production baseline (40+% in cities like Sydney).\n",
      "In self-supervised representation learning, a common idea behind most of the state-of-the-art approaches is to enforce the robustness of the representations to predefined augmentations. A potential issue of this idea is the existence of completely collapsed solutions (i.e., constant features), which are typically avoided implicitly by carefully chosen implementation details. In this work, we study a relatively concise framework containing the most common components from recent approaches. We verify the existence of complete collapse and discover another reachable collapse pattern that is usually overlooked, namely dimensional collapse. We connect dimensional collapse with strong correlations between axes and consider such connection as a strong motivation for feature decorrelation (i.e., standardizing the covariance matrix). The gains from feature decorrelation are verified empirically to highlight the importance and the potential of this insight.\n",
      "This book develops an effective theory approach to understanding deep neural networks of practical relevance. Beginning from a first-principles component-level picture of networks, we explain how to determine an accurate description of the output of trained networks by solving layer-to-layer iteration equations and nonlinear learning dynamics. A main result is that the predictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with the depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from the infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep networks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly analyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a nearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models' predictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple and universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of representation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals through the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain how RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks built from different activation functions into universality classes. Altogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model complexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic techniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network to be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to push this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail about the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.\n",
      "Self-supervised learning has been successfully applied to pre-train video representations, which aims at efficient adaptation from pre-training domain to downstream tasks. Existing approaches merely leverage contrastive loss to learn instance-level discrimination. However, lack of category information will lead to hard-positive problem that constrains the generalization ability of this kind of methods. We find that the multi-task process of meta learning can provide a solution to this problem. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Contrastive Network (MCN), which combines the contrastive learning and meta learning, to enhance the learning ability of existing self-supervised approaches. Our method contains two training stages based on model-agnostic meta learning (MAML), each of which consists of a contrastive branch and a meta branch. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For two downstream tasks, i.e., video action recognition and video retrieval, MCN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. To be more specific, with R(2+1)D backbone, MCN achieves Top-1 accuracies of 84.8% and 54.5% for video action recognition, as well as 52.5% and 23.7% for video retrieval.\n",
      "Contrastive learning has been widely used to train transformer-based vision-language models for video-text alignment and multi-modal representation learning. This paper presents a new algorithm called Token-Aware Cascade contrastive learning (TACo) that improves contrastive learning using two novel techniques. The first is the token-aware contrastive loss which is computed by taking into account the syntactic classes of words. This is motivated by the observation that for a video-text pair, the content words in the text, such as nouns and verbs, are more likely to be aligned with the visual contents in the video than the function words. Second, a cascade sampling method is applied to generate a small set of hard negative examples for efficient loss estimation for multi-modal fusion layers. To validate the effectiveness of TACo, in our experiments we finetune pretrained models for a set of downstream tasks including text-video retrieval (YouCook2, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet), video action step localization (CrossTask), video action segmentation (COIN). The results show that our models attain consistent improvements across different experimental settings over previous methods, setting new state-of-the-art on three public text-video retrieval benchmarks of YouCook2, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet.\n",
      "Learning socially-aware motion representations is at the core of recent advances in multi-agent problems, such as human motion forecasting and robot navigation in crowds. Despite promising progress, existing representations learned with neural networks still struggle to generalize in closed-loop predictions (e.g., output colliding trajectories). This issue largely arises from the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with ill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes from human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from \"positive\" examples, it is difficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of \"negative\" examples like collisions. In this work, we aim to address this issue by explicitly modeling negative examples through self-supervision: (i) we introduce a social contrastive loss that regularizes the extracted motion representation by discerning the ground-truth positive events from synthetic negative ones; (ii) we construct informative negative samples based on our prior knowledge of rare but dangerous circumstances. Our method substantially reduces the collision rates of recent trajectory forecasting, behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.

      "\\emph{Objective and Impact Statement}. With the renaissance of deep learning, automatic diagnostic systems for computed tomography (CT) have achieved many successful applications. However, they are mostly attributed to careful expert annotations, which are often scarce in practice. This drives our interest to the unsupervised representation learning. \\emph{Introduction}. Recent studies have shown that self-supervised learning is an effective approach for learning representations, but most of them rely on the empirical design of transformations and pretext tasks. \\emph{Methods}. To avoid the subjectivity associated with these methods, we propose the MVCNet, a novel unsupervised three dimensional (3D) representation learning method working in a transformation-free manner. We view each 3D lesion from different orientations to collect multiple two dimensional (2D) views. Then, an embedding function is learned by minimizing a contrastive loss so that the 2D views of the same 3D lesion are aggregated, and the 2D views of different lesions are separated. We evaluate the representations by training a simple classification head upon the embedding layer. \\emph{Results}. Experimental results show that MVCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on the LIDC-IDRI (89.55\\%), LNDb (77.69\\%) and TianChi (79.96\\%) datasets for \\emph{unsupervised representation learning}. When fine-tuned on 10\\% of the labeled data, the accuracies are comparable to the supervised learning model (89.46\\% vs. 85.03\\%, 73.85\\% vs. 73.44\\%, 83.56\\% vs. 83.34\\% on the three datasets, respectively). \\emph{Conclusion}. Results indicate the superiority of MVCNet in \\emph{learning representations with limited annotations}.\n",
      "In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for person re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for target. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline, where the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target with pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main limitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative features for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder knowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of technical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise contrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature learning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the unsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA) strategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data. Third, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class separability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier space. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the learning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g., surpassing MMT largely by 8.1\\%, 9.9\\%, 11.4\\% and 11.1\\% mAP on the Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT tasks, respectively.\n",
      "Data analysis has become a necessity in the modern era of cricket. Everything from effective team management to match win predictions use some form of analytics. Meaningful data representations are necessary for efficient analysis of data. In this study we investigate the use of adaptive (learnable) embeddings to represent inter-related features (such as players, teams, etc). The data used for this study is collected from a classical T20 tournament IPL (Indian Premier League). To naturally facilitate the learning of meaningful representations of features for accurate data analysis, we formulate a deep representation learning framework which jointly learns a custom set of embeddings (which represents our features of interest) through the minimization of a contrastive loss. We base our objective on a set of classes obtained as a result of hierarchical clustering on the overall run rate of an innings. It's been assessed that the framework ensures greater generality in the obtained embeddings, on top of which a task based analysis of overall run rate prediction was done to show the reliability of the framework.\n",
      "Machine learning on sets towards sequential output is an important and ubiquitous task, with applications ranging from language modeling and meta-learning to multi-agent strategy games and power grid optimization. Combining elements of representation learning and structured prediction, its two primary challenges include obtaining a meaningful, permutation invariant set representation and subsequently utilizing this representation to output a complex target permutation. This paper provides a comprehensive introduction to the field as well as an overview of important machine learning methods tackling both of these key challenges, with a detailed qualitative comparison of selected model architectures.\n",
      "Deep learning algorithms mine knowledge from the training data and thus would likely inherit the dataset's bias information. As a result, the obtained model would generalize poorly and even mislead the decision process in real-life applications. We propose to remove the bias information misused by the target task with a cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD) method. CSAD explicitly extracts target and bias features disentangled from the latent representation generated by a feature extractor and then learns to discover and remove the correlation between the target and bias features. The correlation measurement plays a critical role in adversarial debiasing and is conducted by a cross-sample neural mutual information estimator. Moreover, we propose joint content and local structural representation learning to boost mutual information estimation for better performance. We conduct thorough experiments on publicly available datasets to validate the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches.\n",
      "Large-scale pretraining of visual representations has led to state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmark computer vision tasks, yet the benefits of these techniques at extreme scale in complex production systems has been relatively unexplored. We consider the case of a popular visual discovery product, where these representations are trained with multi-task learning, from use-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to general representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for retrieval). In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a billion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the performance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to replace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system and performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this backbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised image annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of clustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels. Through a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that large-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to industry computer vision applications. The model is deployed in a production visual shopping system, with 36% improvement in top-1 relevance and 23% improvement in click-through volume. We conduct extensive experiments to better understand the empirical relationships between Transformer-based architectures, dataset scale, and the performance of production vision systems.\n",
      "While self-supervised representation learning (SSL) has received widespread attention from the community, recent research argue that its performance will suffer a cliff fall when the model size decreases. The current method mainly relies on contrastive learning to train the network and in this work, we propose a simple yet effective Distilled Contrastive Learning (DisCo) to ease the issue by a large margin. Specifically, we find the final embedding obtained by the mainstream SSL methods contains the most fruitful information, and propose to distill the final embedding to maximally transmit a teacher's knowledge to a lightweight model by constraining the last embedding of the student to be consistent with that of the teacher. In addition, in the experiment, we find that there exists a phenomenon termed Distilling BottleNeck and present to enlarge the embedding dimension to alleviate this problem. Our method does not introduce any extra parameter to lightweight models during deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art on all lightweight models. Particularly, when ResNet-101/ResNet-50 is used as teacher to teach EfficientNet-B0, the linear result of EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet is very close to ResNet-101/ResNet-50, but the number of parameters of EfficientNet-B0 is only 9.4\\%/16.3\\% of ResNet-101/ResNet-50. Code is available at https://github. com/Yuting-Gao/DisCo-pytorch.\n",
      "We introduce the task of open-vocabulary visual instance search (OVIS). Given an arbitrary textual search query, Open-vocabulary Visual Instance Search (OVIS) aims to return a ranked list of visual instances, i.e., image patches, that satisfies the search intent from an image database. The term \"open vocabulary\" means that there are neither restrictions to the visual instance to be searched nor restrictions to the word that can be used to compose the textual search query. We propose to address such a search challenge via visual-semantic aligned representation learning (ViSA). ViSA leverages massive image-caption pairs as weak image-level (not instance-level) supervision to learn a rich cross-modal semantic space where the representations of visual instances (not images) and those of textual queries are aligned, thus allowing us to measure the similarities between any visual instance and an arbitrary textual query. To evaluate the performance of ViSA, we build two datasets named OVIS40 and OVIS1600 and also introduce a pipeline for error analysis. Through extensive experiments on the two datasets, we demonstrate ViSA's ability to search for visual instances in images not available during training given a wide range of textual queries including those composed of uncommon words. Experimental results show that ViSA achieves an mAP@50 of 21.9% on OVIS40 under the most challenging setting and achieves an mAP@6 of 14.9% on OVIS1600 dataset.\n",
      "Background: Accurate diagnosis of skull base tumors is essential for providing personalized surgical treatment strategies. Intraoperative diagnosis can be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology resources.   Objective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology workflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using label-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI).   Method: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive, high-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\\times$ 1 mm$^\\text{2}$), called stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter cohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning strategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised contrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out, multicenter SRH dataset.   Results: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and malignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies, supervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and diagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our multicenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy of 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised contrastive learning 96.6%. Our trained model was able to identify tumor-normal margins and detect regions of microscopic tumor infiltration in whole-slide SRH images.   Conclusion: SRH with AI models trained using contrastive representation learning can provide rapid and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of skull base tumors.\n",
      "Animals exhibit an innate ability to learn regularities of the world through interaction. By performing experiments in their environment, they are able to discern the causal factors of variation and infer how they affect the world's dynamics. Inspired by this, we attempt to equip reinforcement learning agents with the ability to perform experiments that facilitate a categorization of the rolled-out trajectories, and to subsequently infer the causal factors of the environment in a hierarchical manner. We introduce {\\em causal curiosity}, a novel intrinsic reward, and show that it allows our agents to learn optimal sequences of actions and discover causal factors in the dynamics of the environment. The learned behavior allows the agents to infer a binary quantized representation for the ground-truth causal factors in every environment. Additionally, we find that these experimental behaviors are semantically meaningful (e.g., our agents learn to lift blocks to categorize them by weight), and are learnt in a self-supervised manner with approximately 2.5 times less data than conventional supervised planners. We show that these behaviors can be re-purposed and fine-tuned (e.g., from lifting to pushing or other downstream tasks). Finally, we show that the knowledge of causal factor representations aids zero-shot learning for more complex tasks. Visit https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/causal-curiosity/home for website.\n",
      "The goal of representation learning is different from the ultimate objective of machine learning such as decision making, it is therefore very difficult to establish clear and direct objectives for training representation learning models. It has been argued that a good representation should disentangle the underlying variation factors, yet how to translate this into training objectives remains unknown. This paper presents an attempt to establish direct training criterions and design principles for developing good representation learning models. We propose that a good representation learning model should be maximally expressive, i.e., capable of distinguishing the maximum number of input configurations. We formally define expressiveness and introduce the maximum expressiveness (MEXS) theorem of a general learning model. We propose to train a model by maximizing its expressiveness while at the same time incorporating general priors such as model smoothness. We present a conscience competitive learning algorithm which encourages the model to reach its MEXS whilst at the same time adheres to model smoothness prior. We also introduce a label consistent training (LCT) technique to boost model smoothness by encouraging it to assign consistent labels to similar samples. We present extensive experimental results to show that our method can indeed design representation learning models capable of developing representations that are as good as or better than state of the art. We also show that our technique is computationally efficient, robust against different parameter settings and can work effectively on a variety of datasets.

      "Contrastive learning has revolutionized self-supervised image representation learning field, and recently been adapted to video domain. One of the greatest advantages of contrastive learning is that it allows us to flexibly define powerful loss objectives as long as we can find a reasonable way to formulate positive and negative samples to contrast. However, existing approaches rely heavily on the short-range spatiotemporal salience to form clip-level contrastive signals, thus limit themselves from using global context. In this paper, we propose a new video-level contrastive learning method based on segments to formulate positive pairs. Our formulation is able to capture global context in a video, thus robust to temporal content change. We also incorporate a temporal order regularization term to enforce the inherent sequential structure of videos. Extensive experiments show that our video-level contrastive learning framework (VCLR) is able to outperform previous state-of-the-arts on five video datasets for downstream action classification, action localization and video retrieval.

      "Spectral graph convolutional networks (SGCNs) have been attracting increasing attention in graph representation learning partly due to their interpretability through the prism of the established graph signal processing framework. However, existing SGCNs are limited in implementing graph convolutions with rigid transforms that could not adapt to signals residing on graphs and tasks at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of spectral graph convolutional networks that implement graph convolutions with adaptive graph wavelets. Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural network-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based lifting operations are developed to jointly consider graph structures and node features. We propose to lift based on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the structural information loss induced by partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By design, the locality and sparsity of the resulting wavelet transform as well as the scalability of the lifting structure for large and varying-size graphs are guaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by learning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets, which improves the scalability and interpretablity, and yield a localized, efficient and scalable spectral graph convolution. To ensure that the learned graph representations are invariant to node permutations, a layer is employed at the input of the networks to reorder the nodes according to their local topology information. We evaluate the proposed networks in both node-level and graph-level representation learning tasks on benchmark citation and bioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed networks over existing SGCNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency and scalability.\n",
      "Learning to classify time series with limited data is a practical yet challenging problem. Current methods are primarily based on hand-designed feature extraction rules or domain-specific data augmentation. Motivated by the advances in deep speech processing models and the fact that voice data are univariate temporal signals, in this paper, we propose Voice2Series (V2S), a novel end-to-end approach that reprograms acoustic models for time series classification, through input transformation learning and output label mapping. Leveraging the representation learning power of a large-scale pre-trained speech processing model, on 30 different time series tasks we show that V2S either outperforms or is tied with state-of-the-art methods on 20 tasks, and improves their average accuracy by 1.84%. We further provide a theoretical justification of V2S by proving its population risk is upper bounded by the source risk and a Wasserstein distance accounting for feature alignment via reprogramming. Our results offer new and effective means to time series classification.\n",
      "Electricity load forecasting is crucial for the power systems' planning and maintenance. However, its un-stationary and non-linear characteristics impose significant difficulties in anticipating future demand. This paper proposes a novel ensemble deep Random Vector Functional Link (edRVFL) network for electricity load forecasting. The weights of hidden layers are randomly initialized and kept fixed during the training process. The hidden layers are stacked to enforce deep representation learning. Then, the model generates the forecasts by ensembling the outputs of each layer. Moreover, we also propose to augment the random enhancement features by empirical wavelet transformation (EWT). The raw load data is decomposed by EWT in a walk-forward fashion, not introducing future data leakage problems in the decomposition process. Finally, all the sub-series generated by the EWT, including raw data, are fed into the edRVFL for forecasting purposes. The proposed model is evaluated on twenty publicly available time series from the Australian Energy Market Operator of the year 2020. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed model's superior performance over eleven forecasting methods in three error metrics and statistical tests on electricity load forecasting tasks.\n",
      "Constructing appropriate representations of molecules lies at the core of numerous tasks such as material science, chemistry and drug designs. Recent researches abstract molecules as attributed graphs and employ graph neural networks (GNN) for molecular representation learning, which have made remarkable achievements in molecular graph modeling. Albeit powerful, current models either are based on local aggregation operations and thus miss higher-order graph properties or focus on only node information without fully using the edge information. For this sake, we propose a Communicative Message Passing Transformer (CoMPT) neural network to improve the molecular graph representation by reinforcing message interactions between nodes and edges based on the Transformer architecture. Unlike the previous transformer-style GNNs that treat molecules as fully connected graphs, we introduce a message diffusion mechanism to leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias and reduce the message enrichment explosion. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed model obtained superior performances (around 4$\\%$ on average) against state-of-the-art baselines on seven chemical property datasets (graph-level tasks) and two chemical shift datasets (node-level tasks). Further visualization studies also indicated a better representation capacity achieved by our model.\n",
      "Training machine learning models with the only accuracy as a final goal may promote prejudices and discriminatory behaviors embedded in the data. One solution is to learn latent representations that fulfill specific fairness metrics. Different types of learning methods are employed to map data into the fair representational space. The main purpose is to learn a latent representation of data that scores well on a fairness metric while maintaining the usability for the downstream task. In this paper, we propose a new fair representation learning approach that leverages different levels of representation of data to tighten the fairness bounds of the learned representation. Our results show that stacking different auto-encoders and enforcing fairness at different latent spaces result in an improvement of fairness compared to other existing approaches.\n",
      "Deep learning has proven effective for various application tasks, but its applicability is limited by the reliance on annotated examples. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising direction to alleviate the supervision bottleneck, but existing work focuses on leveraging co-occurrences in unlabeled data for task-agnostic representation learning, as exemplified by masked language model pretraining. In this chapter, we explore task-specific self-supervision, which leverages domain knowledge to automatically annotate noisy training examples for end applications, either by introducing labeling functions for annotating individual instances, or by imposing constraints over interdependent label decisions. We first present deep probabilistic logic(DPL), which offers a unifying framework for task-specific self-supervision by composing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL represents unknown labels as latent variables and incorporates diverse self-supervision using probabilistic logic to train a deep neural network end-to-end using variational EM. Next, we present self-supervised self-supervision(S4), which adds to DPL the capability to learn new self-supervision automatically. Starting from an initial seed self-supervision, S4 iteratively uses the deep neural network to propose new self supervision. These are either added directly (a form of structured self-training) or verified by a human expert (as in feature-based active learning). Experiments on real-world applications such as biomedical machine reading and various text classification tasks show that task-specific self-supervision can effectively leverage domain expertise and often match the accuracy of supervised methods with a tiny fraction of human effort.\n",
      "We propose a novel framework for image clustering that incorporates joint representation learning and clustering. Our method consists of two heads that share the same backbone network - a \"representation learning\" head and a \"clustering\" head. The \"representation learning\" head captures fine-grained patterns of objects at the instance level which serve as clues for the \"clustering\" head to extract coarse-grain information that separates objects into clusters. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end manner by minimizing the weighted sum of two sample-oriented contrastive losses applied to the outputs of the two heads. To ensure that the contrastive loss corresponding to the \"clustering\" head is optimal, we introduce a novel critic function called \"log-of-dot-product\". Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-stage clustering methods across a variety of image datasets, improving over the best baseline by about 5-7% in accuracy on CIFAR10/20, STL10, and ImageNet-Dogs. Further, the \"two-stage\" variant of our method also achieves better results than baselines on three challenging ImageNet subsets.\n",
      "Deep learning models have gained great popularity in statistical modeling because they lead to very competitive regression models, often outperforming classical statistical models such as generalized linear models. The disadvantage of deep learning models is that their solutions are difficult to interpret and explain, and variable selection is not easily possible because deep learning models solve feature engineering and variable selection internally in a nontransparent way. Inspired by the appealing structure of generalized linear models, we propose a new network architecture that shares similar features as generalized linear models, but provides superior predictive power benefiting from the art of representation learning. This new architecture allows for variable selection of tabular data and for interpretation of the calibrated deep learning model, in fact, our approach provides an additive decomposition in the spirit of Shapley values and integrated gradients.\n",
      "Learning effective representations in image-based environments is crucial for sample efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unfortunately, in RL, representation learning is confounded with the exploratory experience of the agent -- learning a useful representation requires diverse data, while effective exploration is only possible with coherent representations. Furthermore, we would like to learn representations that not only generalize across tasks but also accelerate downstream exploration for efficient task-specific training. To address these challenges we propose Proto-RL, a self-supervised framework that ties representation learning with exploration through prototypical representations. These prototypes simultaneously serve as a summarization of the exploratory experience of an agent as well as a basis for representing observations. We pre-train these task-agnostic representations and prototypes on environments without downstream task information. This enables state-of-the-art downstream policy learning on a set of difficult continuous control tasks.\n",
      "Effectively and efficiently deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) at scale remains one of the most challenging aspects of graph representation learning. Many powerful solutions have only ever been validated on comparatively small datasets, often with counter-intuitive outcomes -- a barrier which has been broken by the Open Graph Benchmark Large-Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC). We entered the OGB-LSC with two large-scale GNNs: a deep transductive node classifier powered by bootstrapping, and a very deep (up to 50-layer) inductive graph regressor regularised by denoising objectives. Our models achieved an award-level (top-3) performance on both the MAG240M and PCQM4M benchmarks. In doing so, we demonstrate evidence of scalable self-supervised graph representation learning, and utility of very deep GNNs -- both very important open issues.

      "Despite recent success, most contrastive self-supervised learning methods are domain-specific, relying heavily on data augmentation techniques that require knowledge about a particular domain, such as image cropping and rotation. To overcome such limitation, we propose a novel domain-agnostic approach to contrastive learning, named DACL, that is applicable to domains where invariances, and thus, data augmentation techniques, are not readily available. Key to our approach is the use of Mixup noise to create similar and dissimilar examples by mixing data samples differently either at the input or hidden-state levels. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DACL, we conduct experiments across various domains such as tabular data, images, and graphs. Our results show that DACL not only outperforms other domain-agnostic noising methods, such as Gaussian-noise, but also combines well with domain-specific methods, such as SimCLR, to improve self-supervised visual representation learning. Finally, we theoretically analyze our method and show advantages over the Gaussian-noise based contrastive learning approach.\n",
      "Neural networks leverage robust internal representations in order to generalise. Learning them is difficult, and often requires a large training set that covers the data distribution densely. We study a common setting where our task is not purely opaque. Indeed, very often we may have access to information about the underlying system (e.g. that observations must obey certain laws of physics) that any \"tabula rasa\" neural network would need to re-learn from scratch, penalising data efficiency. We incorporate this information into a pre-trained reasoning module, and investigate its role in shaping the discovered representations in diverse self-supervised learning settings from pixels. Our approach paves the way for a new class of data-efficient representation learning.\n",
      "Treatment effect estimation, which refers to the estimation of causal effects and aims to measure the strength of the causal relationship, is of great importance in many fields but is a challenging problem in practice. As present, data-driven causal effect estimation faces two main challenges, i.e., selection bias and the missing of counterfactual. To address these two issues, most of the existing approaches tend to reduce the selection bias by learning a balanced representation, and then to estimate the counterfactual through the representation. However, they heavily rely on the finely hand-crafted metric functions when learning balanced representations, which generally doesn't work well for the situations where the original distribution is complicated. In this paper, we propose a CETransformer model for casual effect estimation via transformer based representation learning. To learn the representation of covariates(features) robustly, a self-supervised transformer is proposed, by which the correlation between covariates can be well exploited through self-attention mechanism. In addition, an adversarial network is adopted to balance the distribution of the treated and control groups in the representation space. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed CETransformer, compared with the state-of-the-art treatment effect estimation methods.\n",
      "We introduce Neural Contextual Anomaly Detection (NCAD), a framework for anomaly detection on time series that scales seamlessly from the unsupervised to supervised setting, and is applicable to both univariate and multivariate time series. This is achieved by effectively combining recent developments in representation learning for multivariate time series, with techniques for deep anomaly detection originally developed for computer vision that we tailor to the time series setting. Our window-based approach facilitates learning the boundary between normal and anomalous classes by injecting generic synthetic anomalies into the available data. Moreover, our method can effectively take advantage of all the available information, be it as domain knowledge, or as training labels in the semi-supervised setting. We demonstrate empirically on standard benchmark datasets that our approach obtains a state-of-the-art performance in these settings.\n",
      "Large-scale vision and language representation learning has shown promising improvements on various vision-language tasks. Most existing methods employ a transformer-based multimodal encoder to jointly model visual tokens (region-based image features) and word tokens. Because the visual tokens and word tokens are unaligned, it is challenging for the multimodal encoder to learn image-text interactions. In this paper, we introduce a contrastive loss to ALign the image and text representations BEfore Fusing (ALBEF) them through cross-modal attention, which enables more grounded vision and language representation learning. Unlike most existing methods, our method does not require bounding box annotations nor high-resolution images. In order to improve learning from noisy web data, we propose momentum distillation, a self-training method which learns from pseudo-targets produced by a momentum model. We provide a theoretical analysis of ALBEF from a mutual information maximization perspective, showing that different training tasks can be interpreted as different ways to generate views for an image-text pair. ALBEF achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, ALBEF outperforms methods that are pre-trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. On VQA and NLVR$^2$, ALBEF achieves absolute improvements of 2.37% and 3.84% compared to the state-of-the-art, while enjoying faster inference speed.

      "Reward function specification, which requires considerable human effort and iteration, remains a major impediment for learning behaviors through deep reinforcement learning. In contrast, providing visual demonstrations of desired behaviors often presents an easier and more natural way to teach agents. We consider a setting where an agent is provided a fixed dataset of visual demonstrations illustrating how to perform a task, and must learn to solve the task using the provided demonstrations and unsupervised environment interactions. This setting presents a number of challenges including representation learning for visual observations, sample complexity due to high dimensional spaces, and learning instability due to the lack of a fixed reward or learning signal. Towards addressing these challenges, we develop a variational model-based adversarial imitation learning (V-MAIL) algorithm. The model-based approach provides a strong signal for representation learning, enables sample efficiency, and improves the stability of adversarial training by enabling on-policy learning. Through experiments involving several vision-based locomotion and manipulation tasks, we find that V-MAIL learns successful visuomotor policies in a sample-efficient manner, has better stability compared to prior work, and also achieves higher asymptotic performance. We further find that by transferring the learned models, V-MAIL can learn new tasks from visual demonstrations without any additional environment interactions.

      "Learning multimodal representations involves integrating information from multiple heterogeneous sources of data. It is a challenging yet crucial area with numerous real-world applications in multimedia, affective computing, robotics, finance, human-computer interaction, and healthcare. Unfortunately, multimodal research has seen limited resources to study (1) generalization across domains and modalities, (2) complexity during training and inference, and (3) robustness to noisy and missing modalities. In order to accelerate progress towards understudied modalities and tasks while ensuring real-world robustness, we release MultiBench, a systematic and unified large-scale benchmark spanning 15 datasets, 10 modalities, 20 prediction tasks, and 6 research areas. MultiBench provides an automated end-to-end machine learning pipeline that simplifies and standardizes data loading, experimental setup, and model evaluation. To enable holistic evaluation, MultiBench offers a comprehensive methodology to assess (1) generalization, (2) time and space complexity, and (3) modality robustness. MultiBench introduces impactful challenges for future research, including scalability to large-scale multimodal datasets and robustness to realistic imperfections. To accompany this benchmark, we also provide a standardized implementation of 20 core approaches in multimodal learning. Simply applying methods proposed in different research areas can improve the state-of-the-art performance on 9/15 datasets. Therefore, MultiBench presents a milestone in unifying disjoint efforts in multimodal research and paves the way towards a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of multimodal models, all the while ensuring ease of use, accessibility, and reproducibility.

      "A common problem with most zero and few-shot learning approaches is they suffer from bias towards seen classes resulting in sub-optimal performance. Existing efforts aim to utilize unlabeled images from unseen classes (i.e transductive zero-shot) during training to enable generalization. However, this limits their use in practical scenarios where data from target unseen classes is unavailable or infeasible to collect. In this work, we present a practical setting of inductive zero and few-shot learning, where unlabeled images from other out-of-data classes, that do not belong to seen or unseen categories, can be used to improve generalization in any-shot learning. We leverage a formulation based on product-of-experts and introduce a new AUD module that enables us to use unlabeled samples from out-of-data classes which are usually easily available and practically entail no annotation cost. In addition, we also demonstrate the applicability of our model to address a more practical and challenging, Generalized Zero-shot under a limited supervision setting, where even base seen classes do not have sufficient annotated samples.\n",
      "We study model-based offline Reinforcement Learning with general function approximation. We present an algorithm named Constrained Pessimistic Policy Optimization (CPPO) which leverages a general function class and uses a constraint to encode pessimism. Under the assumption that the ground truth model belongs to our function class, CPPO can learn with the offline data only providing partial coverage, i.e., it can learn a policy that completes against any policy that is covered by the offline data, in polynomial sample complexity with respect to the statistical complexity of the function class. We then demonstrate that this algorithmic framework can be applied to many specialized Markov Decision Processes where the additional structural assumptions can further refine the concept of partial coverage. One notable example is low-rank MDP with representation learning where the partial coverage is defined using the concept of relative condition number measured by the underlying unknown ground truth feature representation. Finally, we introduce and study the Bayesian setting in offline RL. The key benefit of Bayesian offline RL is that algorithmically, we do not need to explicitly construct pessimism or reward penalty which could be hard beyond models with linear structures. We present a posterior sampling-based incremental policy optimization algorithm (PS-PO) which proceeds by iteratively sampling a model from the posterior distribution and performing one-step incremental policy optimization inside the sampled model. Theoretically, in expectation with respect to the prior distribution, PS-PO can learn a near optimal policy under partial coverage with polynomial sample complexity.\n",
      "Radiomic representations can quantify properties of regions of interest in medical image data. Classically, they account for pre-defined statistics of shape, texture, and other low-level image features. Alternatively, deep learning-based representations are derived from supervised learning but require expensive annotations from experts and often suffer from overfitting and data imbalance issues. In this work, we address the challenge of learning representations of 3D medical images for an effective quantification under data imbalance. We propose a \\emph{self-supervised} representation learning framework to learn high-level features of 3D volumes as a complement to existing radiomics features. Specifically, we demonstrate how to learn image representations in a self-supervised fashion using a 3D Siamese network. More importantly, we deal with data imbalance by exploiting two unsupervised strategies: a) sample re-weighting, and b) balancing the composition of training batches. When combining our learned self-supervised feature with traditional radiomics, we show significant improvement in brain tumor classification and lung cancer staging tasks covering MRI and CT imaging modalities.\n",
      "Machine learning systems generally assume that the training and testing distributions are the same. To this end, a key requirement is to develop models that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG), i.e., out-of-distribution generalization, has attracted increasing interests in recent years. Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one or several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. Great progress has been made in the area of domain generalization for years. This paper presents the first review of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. We then thoroughly review the theories related to domain generalization and carefully analyze the theory behind generalization. We categorize recent algorithms into three classes: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning strategy, and present several popular algorithms in detail for each category. Third, we introduce the commonly used datasets and applications. Finally, we summarize existing literature and present some potential research topics for the future.\n",
      "Time-series generated by end-users, edge devices, and different wearables are mostly unlabelled. We propose a method to auto-generate labels of un-labelled time-series, exploiting very few representative labelled time-series. Our method is based on representation learning using Auto Encoded Compact Sequence (AECS) with a choice of best distance measure. It performs self-correction in iterations, by learning latent structure, as well as synthetically boosting representative time-series using Variational-Auto-Encoder (VAE) to improve the quality of labels. We have experimented with UCR and UCI archives, public real-world univariate, multivariate time-series taken from different application domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is very close to the performance achieved by fully supervised classification. The proposed method not only produces close to benchmark results but outperforms the benchmark performance in some cases.\n",
      "Many machine learning models have been built to tackle information overload issues on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) platforms. These models rely on learning powerful representations of MOOC entities. However, they suffer from the problem of scarce expert label data. To overcome this problem, we propose to learn pre-trained representations of MOOC entities using abundant unlabeled data from the structure of MOOCs which can directly be applied to the downstream tasks. While existing pre-training methods have been successful in NLP areas as they learn powerful textual representation, their models do not leverage the richer information about MOOC entities. This richer information includes the graph relationship between the lectures, concepts, and courses along with the domain knowledge about the complexity of a concept. We develop MOOCRep, a novel method based on Transformer language model trained with two pre-training objectives : 1) graph-based objective to capture the powerful signal of entities and relations that exist in the graph, and 2) domain-oriented objective to effectively incorporate the complexity level of concepts. Our experiments reveal that MOOCRep's embeddings outperform state-of-the-art representation learning methods on two tasks important for education community, concept pre-requisite prediction and lecture recommendation.\n",
      "Learning disentangled and interpretable representations is an important step towards accomplishing comprehensive data representations on the manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel representation learning algorithm which combines the inference abilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with the generalization capability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The proposed model, called InfoVAEGAN, consists of three networks~: Encoder, Generator and Discriminator. InfoVAEGAN aims to jointly learn discrete and continuous interpretable representations in an unsupervised manner by using two different data-free log-likelihood functions onto the variables sampled from the generator's distribution. We propose a two-stage algorithm for optimizing the inference network separately from the generator training. Moreover, we enforce the learning of interpretable representations through the maximization of the mutual information between the existing latent variables and those created through generative and inference processes.\n",
      "Graph representation learning has attracted a surge of interest recently, whose target at learning discriminant embedding for each node in the graph. Most of these representation methods focus on supervised learning and heavily depend on label information. However, annotating graphs are expensive to obtain in the real world, especially in specialized domains (i.e. biology), as it needs the annotator to have the domain knowledge to label the graph. To approach this problem, self-supervised learning provides a feasible solution for graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Graph Contrastive Learning (MLGCL) framework for learning robust representation of graph data by contrasting space views of graphs. Specifically, we introduce a novel contrastive view - topological and feature space views. The original graph is first-order approximation structure and contains uncertainty or error, while the $k$NN graph generated by encoding features preserves high-order proximity. Thus $k$NN graph generated by encoding features not only provide a complementary view, but is more suitable to GNN encoder to extract discriminant representation. Furthermore, we develop a multi-level contrastive mode to preserve the local similarity and semantic similarity of graph-structured data simultaneously. Extensive experiments indicate MLGCL achieves promising results compared with the existing state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods on seven datasets.\n",
      "A real-world graph has a complex topological structure, which is often formed by the interaction of different latent factors. Disentanglement of these latent factors can effectively improve the robustness and expressiveness of node representation of graph. However, most existing methods lack consideration of the intrinsic differences in relations between nodes caused by factor entanglement. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Disentangled Graph Convolutional Network (ADGCN) for disentangled graph representation learning. Specifically, a component-specific aggregation approach is proposed to achieve micro-disentanglement by inferring latent components that caused the links between nodes. On the basis of micro-disentanglement, we further propose a macro-disentanglement adversarial regularizer to improve the separability among component distributions, thus restricting the interdependence among components. Additionally, to reveal the topological graph structure, a diversity-preserving node sampling approach is proposed, by which the graph structure can be progressively refined in a way of local structure awareness. The experimental results on various real-world graph data verify that our ADGCN obtains more favorable performance over currently available alternatives.\n",
      "Any clustering algorithm must synchronously learn to model the clusters and allocate data to those clusters in the absence of labels. Mixture model-based methods model clusters with pre-defined statistical distributions and allocate data to those clusters based on the cluster likelihoods. They iteratively refine those distribution parameters and member assignments following the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. However, the cluster representability of such hand-designed distributions that employ a limited amount of parameters is not adequate for most real-world clustering tasks. In this paper, we realize mixture model-based clustering with a neural network where the final layer neurons, with the aid of an additional transformation, approximate cluster distribution outputs. The network parameters pose as the parameters of those distributions. The result is an elegant, much-generalized representation of clusters than a restricted mixture of hand-designed distributions. We train the network end-to-end via batch-wise EM iterations where the forward pass acts as the E-step and the backward pass acts as the M-step. In image clustering, the mixture-based EM objective can be used as the clustering objective along with existing representation learning methods. In particular, we show that when mixture-EM optimization is fused with consistency optimization, it improves the sole consistency optimization performance in clustering. Our trained networks outperform single-stage deep clustering methods that still depend on k-means, with unsupervised classification accuracy of 63.8% in STL10, 58% in CIFAR10, 25.9% in CIFAR100, and 98.9% in MNIST.\n",
      "Contrastive learning applied to self-supervised representation learning has seen a resurgence in deep models. In this paper, we find that existing contrastive learning based solutions for self-supervised video recognition focus on inter-variance encoding but ignore the intra-variance existing in clips within the same video. We thus propose to learn dual representations for each clip which (\\romannumeral 1) encode intra-variance through a shuffle-rank pretext task; (\\romannumeral 2) encode inter-variance through a temporal coherent contrastive loss. Experiment results show that our method plays an essential role in balancing inter and intra variances and brings consistent performance gains on multiple backbones and contrastive learning frameworks. Integrated with SimCLR and pretrained on Kinetics-400, our method achieves $\\textbf{82.0\\%}$ and $\\textbf{51.2\\%}$ downstream classification accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51 test sets respectively and $\\textbf{46.1\\%}$ video retrieval accuracy on UCF101, outperforming both pretext-task based and contrastive learning based counterparts.\n",
      "Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown its ability in solving complicated problems directly from high-dimensional observations. However, in end-to-end settings, Reinforcement Learning algorithms are not sample-efficient and requires long training times and quantities of data. In this work, we proposed a framework for sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning that take advantage of state and action representations to transform a high-dimensional problem into a low-dimensional one. Moreover, we seek to find the optimal policy mapping latent states to latent actions. Because now the policy is learned on abstract representations, we enforce, using auxiliary loss functions, the lifting of such policy to the original problem domain. Results show that the novel framework can efficiently learn low-dimensional and interpretable state and action representations and the optimal latent policy.\n",
      "Self-supervised learning and pre-training strategies have developed over the last few years especially for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Recently application of such methods can also be noticed for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) . In this paper, we have used a graph based self-supervised learning strategy with different loss functions (Barlow Twins[Zbontar et al., 2021], HSIC[Tsai et al., 2021], VICReg[Bardes et al., 2021]) which have shown promising results when applied with CNNs previously. We have also proposed a hybrid loss function combining the advantages of VICReg and HSIC and called it as VICRegHSIC. The performance of these aforementioned methods have been compared when applied to different datasets such as MUTAG, PROTEINS and IMDB-Binary. Moreover, the impact of different batch sizes, projector dimensions and data augmentation strategies have also been explored\n",
      "An effective approach in meta-learning is to utilize multiple \"train tasks\" to learn a good initialization for model parameters that can help solve unseen \"test tasks\" with very few samples by fine-tuning from this initialization. Although successful in practice, theoretical understanding of such methods is limited. This work studies an important aspect of these methods: splitting the data from each task into train (support) and validation (query) sets during meta-training. Inspired by recent work (Raghu et al., 2020), we view such meta-learning methods through the lens of representation learning and argue that the train-validation split encourages the learned representation to be low-rank without compromising on expressivity, as opposed to the non-splitting variant that encourages high-rank representations. Since sample efficiency benefits from low-rankness, the splitting strategy will require very few samples to solve unseen test tasks. We present theoretical results that formalize this idea for linear representation learning on a subspace meta-learning instance, and experimentally verify this practical benefit of splitting in simulations and on standard meta-learning benchmarks.\n",
      "Visual recognition tasks are often limited to dealing with a small subset of classes simply because the labels for the remaining classes are unavailable. We are interested in identifying novel concepts in a dataset through representation learning based on the examples in both labeled and unlabeled classes, and extending the horizon of recognition to both known and novel classes. To address this challenging task, we propose a combinatorial learning approach, which naturally clusters the examples in unseen classes using the compositional knowledge given by multiple supervised meta-classifiers on heterogeneous label spaces. We also introduce a metric learning strategy to estimate pairwise pseudo-labels for improving representations of unlabeled examples, which preserves semantic relations across known and novel classes effectively. The proposed algorithm discovers novel concepts via a joint optimization of enhancing the discrimitiveness of unseen classes as well as learning the representations of known classes generalizable to novel ones. Our extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable performance gains by the proposed approach in multiple image retrieval and novel class discovery benchmarks.\n",
      "Self-supervised contrastive representation learning has proved incredibly successful in the vision and natural language domains, enabling state-of-the-art performance with orders of magnitude less labeled data. However, such methods are domain-specific and little has been done to leverage this technique on real-world tabular datasets. We propose SCARF, a simple, widely-applicable technique for contrastive learning, where views are formed by corrupting a random subset of features. When applied to pre-train deep neural networks on the 69 real-world, tabular classification datasets from the OpenML-CC18 benchmark, SCARF not only improves classification accuracy in the fully-supervised setting but does so also in the presence of label noise and in the semi-supervised setting where only a fraction of the available training data is labeled. We show that SCARF complements existing strategies and outperforms alternatives like autoencoders. We conduct comprehensive ablations, detailing the importance of a range of factors.\n",
      "Low-prior targets are common among many important clinical events, which introduces the challenge of having enough data to support learning of their predictive models. Many prior works have addressed this problem by first building a general patient-state representation model, and then adapting it to a new low-prior prediction target. In this schema, there is potential for the predictive performance to be hindered by the misalignment between the general patient-state model and the target task. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new method that simultaneously optimizes a shared model through multi-task learning of both the low-prior supervised target and general purpose patient-state representation (GPSR). More specifically, our method improves prediction performance of a low-prior task by jointly optimizing a shared model that combines the loss of the target event and a broad range of generic clinical events. We study the approach in the context of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Through extensive experiments on multiple clinical event targets using MIMIC-III data, we show that the inclusion of general patient-state representation tasks during model training improves the prediction of individual low-prior targets.\n",
      "For an image query, unsupervised contrastive learning labels crops of the same image as positives, and other image crops as negatives. Although intuitive, such a native label assignment strategy cannot reveal the underlying semantic similarity between a query and its positives and negatives, and impairs performance, since some negatives are semantically similar to the query or even share the same semantic class as the query. In this work, we first prove that for contrastive learning, inaccurate label assignment heavily impairs its generalization for semantic instance discrimination, while accurate labels benefit its generalization. Inspired by this theory, we propose a novel self-labeling refinement approach for contrastive learning. It improves the label quality via two complementary modules: (i) self-labeling refinery (SLR) to generate accurate labels and (ii) momentum mixup (MM) to enhance similarity between query and its positive. SLR uses a positive of a query to estimate semantic similarity between a query and its positive and negatives, and combines estimated similarity with vanilla label assignment in contrastive learning to iteratively generate more accurate and informative soft labels. We theoretically show that our SLR can exactly recover the true semantic labels of label-corrupted data, and supervises networks to achieve zero prediction error on classification tasks. MM randomly combines queries and positives to increase semantic similarity between the generated virtual queries and their positives so as to improves label accuracy. Experimental results on CIFAR10, ImageNet, VOC and COCO show the effectiveness of our method. PyTorch code and model will be released online.\n",
      "Learning decent representations from unlabeled time-series data with temporal dynamics is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Time-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual Contrasting (TS-TCC), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. First, the raw time-series data are transformed into two different yet correlated views by using weak and strong augmentations. Second, we propose a novel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by designing a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn discriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module built upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to maximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while minimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have been carried out on three real-world time-series datasets. The results manifest that training a linear classifier on top of the features learned by our proposed TS-TCC performs comparably with the supervised training. Additionally, our proposed TS-TCC shows high efficiency in few-labeled data and transfer learning scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/emadeldeen24/TS-TCC.\n",
      "In vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, it is prevalent to assign the auxiliary task with a surrogate self-supervised loss so as to obtain more semantic representations and improve sample efficiency. However, abundant information in self-supervised auxiliary tasks has been disregarded, since the representation learning part and the decision-making part are separated. To sufficiently utilize information in the auxiliary task, we present a simple yet effective idea to employ self-supervised loss as an intrinsic reward, called Intrinsically Motivated Self-Supervised learning in Reinforcement learning (IM-SSR). We formally show that the self-supervised loss can be decomposed as exploration for novel states and robustness improvement from nuisance elimination. IM-SSR can be effortlessly plugged into any reinforcement learning with self-supervised auxiliary objectives with nearly no additional cost. Combined with IM-SSR, the previous underlying algorithms achieve salient improvements on both sample efficiency and generalization in various vision-based robotics tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, especially when the reward signal is sparse.\n",
      "We introduce the Graph Mixture Density Networks, a new family of machine learning models that can fit multimodal output distributions conditioned on graphs of arbitrary topology. By combining ideas from mixture models and graph representation learning, we address a broader class of challenging conditional density estimation problems that rely on structured data. In this respect, we evaluate our method on a new benchmark application that leverages random graphs for stochastic epidemic simulations. We show a significant improvement in the likelihood of epidemic outcomes when taking into account both multimodality and structure. The empirical analysis is complemented by two real-world regression tasks showing the effectiveness of our approach in modeling the output prediction uncertainty. Graph Mixture Density Networks open appealing research opportunities in the study of structure-dependent phenomena that exhibit non-trivial conditional output distributions.\n",
      "Recent contrastive representation learning methods rely on estimating mutual information (MI) between multiple views of an underlying context. E.g., we can derive multiple views of a given image by applying data augmentation, or we can split a sequence into views comprising the past and future of some step in the sequence. Contrastive lower bounds on MI are easy to optimize, but have a strong underestimation bias when estimating large amounts of MI. We propose decomposing the full MI estimation problem into a sum of smaller estimation problems by splitting one of the views into progressively more informed subviews and by applying the chain rule on MI between the decomposed views. This expression contains a sum of unconditional and conditional MI terms, each measuring modest chunks of the total MI, which facilitates approximation via contrastive bounds. To maximize the sum, we formulate a contrastive lower bound on the conditional MI which can be approximated efficiently. We refer to our general approach as Decomposed Estimation of Mutual Information (DEMI). We show that DEMI can capture a larger amount of MI than standard non-decomposed contrastive bounds in a synthetic setting, and learns better representations in a vision domain and for dialogue generation.\n",
      "Causality knowledge is vital to building robust AI systems. Deep learning models often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is often derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately available in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has unraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence of causality. While language representation models preserve contextual knowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships during training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an existing model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene understanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better performance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring about. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task of mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However, there does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by juxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and easy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are denser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information offers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a framework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos and natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a causal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error analysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using a two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models (BERT, GPT-2) as well as current state-of-the-art multimodal causality models.\n",
      "Machine learning models that incorporate concept learning as an intermediate step in their decision making process can match the performance of black-box predictive models while retaining the ability to explain outcomes in human understandable terms. However, we demonstrate that the concept representations learned by these models encode information beyond the pre-defined concepts, and that natural mitigation strategies do not fully work, rendering the interpretation of the downstream prediction misleading. We describe the mechanism underlying the information leakage and suggest recourse for mitigating its effects.\n",
      "The claims data, containing medical codes, services information, and incurred expenditure, can be a good resource for estimating an individual's health condition and medical risk level. In this study, we developed Transformer-based Multimodal AutoEncoder (TMAE), an unsupervised learning framework that can learn efficient patient representation by encoding meaningful information from the claims data. TMAE is motivated by the practical needs in healthcare to stratify patients into different risk levels for improving care delivery and management. Compared to previous approaches, TMAE is able to 1) model inpatient, outpatient, and medication claims collectively, 2) handle irregular time intervals between medical events, 3) alleviate the sparsity issue of the rare medical codes, and 4) incorporate medical expenditure information. We trained TMAE using a real-world pediatric claims dataset containing more than 600,000 patients and compared its performance with various approaches in two clustering tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TMAE has superior performance compared to all baselines. Multiple downstream applications are also conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The promising results confirm that the TMAE framework is scalable to large claims data and is able to generate efficient patient embeddings for risk stratification and analysis.\n",
      "While representation learning has yielded a great success on many graph learning tasks, there is little understanding behind the structures that are being captured by these embeddings. For example, we wonder if the topological features, such as the Triangle Count, the Degree of the node and other centrality measures are concretely encoded in the embeddings. Furthermore, we ask if the presence of these structures in the embeddings is necessary for a better performance on the downstream tasks, such as clustering and classification. To address these questions, we conduct an extensive empirical study over three classes of unsupervised graph embedding models and seven different variants of Graph Autoencoders. Our results show that five topological features: the Degree, the Local Clustering Score, the Betweenness Centrality, the Eigenvector Centrality, and Triangle Count are concretely preserved in the first layer of the graph autoencoder that employs the SUM aggregation rule, under the condition that the model preserves the second-order proximity. We supplement further evidence for the presence of these features by revealing a hierarchy in the distribution of the topological features in the embeddings of the aforementioned model. We also show that a model with such properties can outperform other models on certain downstream tasks, especially when the preserved features are relevant to the task at hand. Finally, we evaluate the suitability of our findings through a test case study related to social influence prediction.\n",
      "Self-supervised learning (especially contrastive learning) has attracted great interest due to its tremendous potentials in learning discriminative representations in an unsupervised manner. Despite the acknowledged successes, existing contrastive learning methods suffer from very low learning efficiency, e.g., taking about ten times more training epochs than supervised learning for comparable recognition accuracy. In this paper, we discover two contradictory phenomena in contrastive learning that we call under-clustering and over-clustering problems, which are major obstacles to learning efficiency. Under-clustering means that the model cannot efficiently learn to discover the dissimilarity between inter-class samples when the negative sample pairs for contrastive learning are insufficient to differentiate all the actual object categories. Over-clustering implies that the model cannot efficiently learn the feature representation from excessive negative sample pairs, which enforces the model to over-cluster samples of the same actual categories into different clusters. To simultaneously overcome these two problems, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework using a median triplet loss. Precisely, we employ a triplet loss tending to maximize the relative distance between the positive pair and negative pairs to address the under-clustering problem; and we construct the negative pair by selecting the negative sample of a median similarity score from all negative samples to avoid the over-clustering problem, guaranteed by the Bernoulli Distribution model. We extensively evaluate our proposed framework in several large-scale benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, SYSU-30k, and COCO). The results demonstrate the superior performance (e.g., the learning efficiency) of our model over the latest state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin.

      "Multi-label image classification (MLIC) is a fundamental and practical task, which aims to assign multiple possible labels to an image. In recent years, many deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches have been proposed which model label correlations to discover semantics of labels and learn semantic representations of images. This paper advances this research direction by improving both the modeling of label correlations and the learning of semantic representations. On the one hand, besides the local semantics of each label, we propose to further explore global semantics shared by multiple labels. On the other hand, existing approaches mainly learn the semantic representations at the last convolutional layer of a CNN. But it has been noted that the image representations of different layers of CNN capture different levels or scales of features and have different discriminative abilities. We thus propose to learn semantic representations at multiple convolutional layers. To this end, this paper designs a Multi-layered Semantic Representation Network (MSRN) which discovers both local and global semantics of labels through modeling label correlations and utilizes the label semantics to guide the semantic representations learning at multiple layers through an attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets including VOC 2007, COCO, NUS-WIDE, and Apparel show a competitive performance of the proposed MSRN against state-of-the-art models.\n",
      "Recently introduced self-supervised methods for image representation learning provide on par or superior results to their fully supervised competitors, yet the corresponding efforts to explain the self-supervised approaches lag behind. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel visual probing framework for explaining the self-supervised models by leveraging probing tasks employed previously in natural language processing. The probing tasks require knowledge about semantic relationships between image parts. Hence, we propose a systematic approach to obtain analogs of natural language in vision, such as visual words, context, and taxonomy. Our proposal is grounded in Marr's computational theory of vision and concerns features like textures, shapes, and lines. We show the effectiveness and applicability of those analogs in the context of explaining self-supervised representations. Our key findings emphasize that relations between language and vision can serve as an effective yet intuitive tool for discovering how machine learning models work, independently of data modality. Our work opens a plethora of research pathways towards more explainable and transparent AI.\n",
      "Neural shape representations have recently shown to be effective in shape analysis and reconstruction tasks. Existing neural network methods require point coordinates and corresponding normal vectors to learn the implicit level sets of the shape. Normal vectors are often not provided as raw data, therefore, approximation and reorientation are required as pre-processing stages, both of which can introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a divergence guided shape representation learning approach that does not require normal vectors as input. We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the divergence of the distance function favours smooth solutions that reliably orients gradients to match the unknown normal at each point, in some cases even better than approaches that use ground truth normal vectors directly. Additionally, we introduce a novel geometric initialization method for sinusoidal shape representation networks that further improves convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of surface reconstruction and show state-of-the-art performance compared to other unoriented methods and on-par performance compared to oriented methods.\n",
      "Radars and cameras are mature, cost-effective, and robust sensors and have been widely used in the perception stack of mass-produced autonomous driving systems. Due to their complementary properties, outputs from radar detection (radar pins) and camera perception (2D bounding boxes) are usually fused to generate the best perception results. The key to successful radar-camera fusion is the accurate data association. The challenges in the radar-camera association can be attributed to the complexity of driving scenes, the noisy and sparse nature of radar measurements, and the depth ambiguity from 2D bounding boxes. Traditional rule-based association methods are susceptible to performance degradation in challenging scenarios and failure in corner cases. In this study, we propose to address radar-camera association via deep representation learning, to explore feature-level interaction and global reasoning. Additionally, we design a loss sampling mechanism and an innovative ordinal loss to overcome the difficulty of imperfect labeling and to enforce critical human-like reasoning. Despite being trained with noisy labels generated by a rule-based algorithm, our proposed method achieves a performance of 92.2% F1 score, which is 11.6% higher than the rule-based teacher. Moreover, this data-driven method also lends itself to continuous improvement via corner case mining.\n",
      "Representing games through their pixels offers a promising approach for building general-purpose and versatile game models. While games are not merely images, neural network models trained on game pixels often capture differences of the visual style of the image rather than the content of the game. As a result, such models cannot generalize well even within similar games of the same genre. In this paper we build on recent advances in contrastive learning and showcase its benefits for representation learning in games. Learning to contrast images of games not only classifies games in a more efficient manner; it also yields models that separate games in a more meaningful fashion by ignoring the visual style and focusing, instead, on their content. Our results in a large dataset of sports video games containing 100k images across 175 games and 10 game genres suggest that contrastive learning is better suited for learning generalized game representations compared to conventional supervised learning. The findings of this study bring us closer to universal visual encoders for games that can be reused across previously unseen games without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.\n",
      "Graph convolution networks, like message passing graph convolution networks (MPGCNs), have been a powerful tool in representation learning of networked data. However, when data is heterogeneous, most architectures are limited as they employ a single strategy to handle multi-channel graph signals and they typically focus on low-frequency information. In this paper, we present a novel graph convolution operator, termed BankGCN, which keeps benefits of message passing models, but extends their capabilities beyond `low-pass' features. It decomposes multi-channel signals on graphs into subspaces and handles particular information in each subspace with an adapted filter. The filters of all subspaces have different frequency responses and together form a filter bank. Furthermore, each filter in the spectral domain corresponds to a message passing scheme, and diverse schemes are implemented via the filter bank. Importantly, the filter bank and the signal decomposition are jointly learned to adapt to the spectral characteristics of data and to target applications. Furthermore, this is implemented almost without extra parameters in comparison with most existing MPGCNs. Experimental results show that the proposed convolution operator permits to achieve excellent performance in graph classification on a collection of benchmark graph datasets.\n",
      "This paper investigates two techniques for developing efficient self-supervised vision transformers (EsViT) for visual representation learning. First, we show through a comprehensive empirical study that multi-stage architectures with sparse self-attentions can significantly reduce modeling complexity but with a cost of losing the ability to capture fine-grained correspondences between image regions. Second, we propose a new pre-training task of region matching which allows the model to capture fine-grained region dependencies and as a result significantly improves the quality of the learned vision representations. Our results show that combining the two techniques, EsViT achieves 81.3% top-1 on the ImageNet linear probe evaluation, outperforming prior arts with around an order magnitude of higher throughput. When transferring to downstream linear classification tasks, EsViT outperforms its supervised counterpart on 17 out of 18 datasets. The code and models will be publicly available.\n",
      "Generalization has been a long-standing challenge for reinforcement learning (RL). Visual RL, in particular, can be easily distracted by irrelevant factors in high-dimensional observation space. In this work, we consider robust policy learning which targets zero-shot generalization to unseen visual environments with large distributional shift. We propose SECANT, a novel self-expert cloning technique that leverages image augmentation in two stages to decouple robust representation learning from policy optimization. Specifically, an expert policy is first trained by RL from scratch with weak augmentations. A student network then learns to mimic the expert policy by supervised learning with strong augmentations, making its representation more robust against visual variations compared to the expert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SECANT significantly advances the state of the art in zero-shot generalization across 4 challenging domains. Our average reward improvements over prior SOTAs are: DeepMind Control (+26.5%), robotic manipulation (+337.8%), vision-based autonomous driving (+47.7%), and indoor object navigation (+15.8%). Code release and video are available at https://linxifan.github.io/secant-site/.\n",
      "Multiple views of data, both naturally acquired (e.g., image and audio) and artificially produced (e.g., via adding different noise to data samples), have proven useful in enhancing representation learning. Natural views are often handled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation analysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., SimCLR and Barlow Twins. Both types of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that the embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although intuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is only empirically validated. This work puts forth a theory-backed framework for unsupervised multiview learning. Our development starts with proposing a multiview model, where each view is a nonlinear mixture of shared and private components. Consequently, the learning problem boils down to shared/private component identification and disentanglement. Under this model, latent correlation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared components across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, the private information in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using proper regularization design. The method is tested on a series of tasks, e.g., downstream clustering, which all show promising performance. Our development also provides a unifying perspective for understanding various DCCA and SSL schemes.\n",
      "Graph-level representations are critical in various real-world applications, such as predicting the properties of molecules. But in practice, precise graph annotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, graph contrastive learning constructs instance discrimination task which pulls together positive pairs (augmentation pairs of the same graph) and pushes away negative pairs (augmentation pairs of different graphs) for unsupervised representation learning. However, since for a query, its negatives are uniformly sampled from all graphs, existing methods suffer from the critical sampling bias issue, i.e., the negatives likely having the same semantic structure with the query, leading to performance degradation. To mitigate this sampling bias issue, in this paper, we propose a Prototypical Graph Contrastive Learning (PGCL) approach. Specifically, PGCL models the underlying semantic structure of the graph data via clustering semantically similar graphs into the same group, and simultaneously encourages the clustering consistency for different augmentations of the same graph. Then given a query, it performs negative sampling via drawing the graphs from those clusters that differ from the cluster of query, which ensures the semantic difference between query and its negative samples. Moreover, for a query, PGCL further reweights its negative samples based on the distance between their prototypes (cluster centroids) and the query prototype such that those negatives having moderate prototype distance enjoy relatively large weights. This reweighting strategy is proved to be more effective than uniform sampling. Experimental results on various graph benchmarks testify the advantages of our PGCL over state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.\n",
      "Path representations are critical in a variety of transportation applications, such as estimating path ranking in path recommendation systems and estimating path travel time in navigation systems. Existing studies often learn task-specific path representations in a supervised manner, which require a large amount of labeled training data and generalize poorly to other tasks. We propose an unsupervised learning framework Path InfoMax (PIM) to learn generic path representations that work for different downstream tasks. We first propose a curriculum negative sampling method, for each input path, to generate a small amount of negative paths, by following the principles of curriculum learning. Next, \\emph{PIM} employs mutual information maximization to learn path representations from both a global and a local view. In the global view, PIM distinguishes the representations of the input paths from those of the negative paths. In the local view, \\emph{PIM} distinguishes the input path representations from the representations of the nodes that appear only in the negative paths. This enables the learned path representations to encode both global and local information at different scales. Extensive experiments on two downstream tasks, ranking score estimation and travel time estimation, using two road network datasets suggest that PIM significantly outperforms other unsupervised methods and is also able to be used as a pre-training method to enhance supervised path representation learning.\n",
      "Attention mechanism enables the Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) to learn the attention weights between the target node and its one-hop neighbors, the performance is further improved. However, the most existing GNNs are oriented to homogeneous graphs and each layer can only aggregate the information of one-hop neighbors. Stacking multi-layer networks will introduce a lot of noise and easily lead to over smoothing. We propose a Multi-hop Heterogeneous Neighborhood information Fusion graph representation learning method (MHNF). Specifically, we first propose a hybrid metapath autonomous extraction model to efficiently extract multi-hop hybrid neighbors. Then, we propose a hop-level heterogeneous Information aggregation model, which selectively aggregates different-hop neighborhood information within the same hybrid metapath. Finally, a hierarchical semantic attention fusion model (HSAF) is proposed, which can efficiently integrate different-hop and different-path neighborhood information respectively. This paper can solve the problem of aggregating the multi-hop neighborhood information and can learn hybrid metapaths for target task, reducing the limitation of manually specifying metapaths. In addition, HSAF can extract the internal node information of the metapaths and better integrate the semantic information of different levels. Experimental results on real datasets show that MHNF is superior to state-of-the-art methods in node classification and clustering tasks (10.94% - 69.09% and 11.58% - 394.93% relative improvement on average, respectively).\n",
      "We present an online multi-task learning approach for adaptive nonlinear control, which we call Online Meta-Adaptive Control (OMAC). The goal is to control a nonlinear system subject to adversarial disturbance and unknown $\\textit{environment-dependent}$ nonlinear dynamics, under the assumption that the environment-dependent dynamics can be well captured with some shared representation. Our approach is motivated by robot control, where a robotic system encounters a sequence of new environmental conditions that it must quickly adapt to. A key emphasis is to integrate online representation learning with established methods from control theory, in order to arrive at a unified framework that yields both control-theoretic and learning-theoretic guarantees. We provide instantiations of our approach under varying conditions, leading to the first non-asymptotic end-to-end convergence guarantee for multi-task adaptive nonlinear control. OMAC can also be integrated with deep representation learning. Experiments show that OMAC significantly outperforms conventional adaptive control approaches which do not learn the shared representation.\n",
      "Real-world applications of machine learning tools in high-stakes domains are often regulated to be fair, in the sense that the predicted target should satisfy some quantitative notion of parity with respect to a protected attribute. However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy with a real-valued target is not clear. In this paper, we characterize the inherent tradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the regression setting by providing a lower bound on the error of any fair regressor. Our lower bound is sharp, algorithm-independent, and admits a simple interpretation: when the moments of the target differ between groups, any fair algorithm has to make a large error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this result to give a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair algorithm, using the Wasserstein distance to measure the quality of the approximation. On the upside, we establish the first connection between individual fairness, accuracy parity, and the Wasserstein distance by showing that if a regressor is individually fair, it also approximately verifies the accuracy parity, where the gap is given by the Wasserstein distance between the two groups. Inspired by our theoretical results, we develop a practical algorithm for fair regression through the lens of representation learning, and conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to corroborate our findings.\n",
      "The inductive biases of graph representation learning algorithms are often encoded in the background geometry of their embedding space. In this paper, we show that general directed graphs can be effectively represented by an embedding model that combines three components: a pseudo-Riemannian metric structure, a non-trivial global topology, and a unique likelihood function that explicitly incorporates a preferred direction in embedding space. We demonstrate the representational capabilities of this method by applying it to the task of link prediction on a series of synthetic and real directed graphs from natural language applications and biology. In particular, we show that low-dimensional cylindrical Minkowski and anti-de Sitter spacetimes can produce equal or better graph representations than curved Riemannian manifolds of higher dimensions.\n",
      "While multitask representation learning has become a popular approach in reinforcement learning (RL), theoretical understanding of why and when it works remains limited. This paper presents analyses for the statistical benefit of multitask representation learning in linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) under a generative model. In this paper, we consider an agent to learn a representation function $\\phi$ out of a function class $\\Phi$ from $T$ source tasks with $N$ data per task, and then use the learned $\\hat{\\phi}$ to reduce the required number of sample for a new task. We first discover a \\emph{Least-Activated-Feature-Abundance} (LAFA) criterion, denoted as $\\kappa$, with which we prove that a straightforward least-square algorithm learns a policy which is $\\tilde{O}(H^2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2 \\kappa d}{NT}+\\frac{\\kappa d}{n}})$ sub-optimal. Here $H$ is the planning horizon, $\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)$ is $\\Phi$'s complexity measure, $d$ is the dimension of the representation (usually $d\\ll \\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)$) and $n$ is the number of samples for the new task. Thus the required $n$ is $O(\\kappa d H^4)$ for the sub-optimality to be close to zero, which is much smaller than $O(\\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2\\kappa d H^4)$ in the setting without multitask representation learning, whose sub-optimality gap is $\\tilde{O}(H^2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\kappa \\mathcal{C}(\\Phi)^2d}{n}})$. This theoretically explains the power of multitask representation learning in reducing sample complexity. Further, we note that to ensure high sample efficiency, the LAFA criterion $\\kappa$ should be small. In fact, $\\kappa$ varies widely in magnitude depending on the different sampling distribution for new task. This indicates adaptive sampling technique is important to make $\\kappa$ solely depend on $d$. Finally, we provide empirical results of a noisy grid-world environment to corroborate our theoretical findings.\n",
      "Learning meaningful representations of data is an important aspect of machine learning and has recently been successfully applied to many domains like language understanding or computer vision. Instead of training a model for one specific task, representation learning is about training a model to capture all useful information in the underlying data and make it accessible for a predictor. For predictive process analytics, it is essential to have all explanatory characteristics of a process instance available when making predictions about the future, as well as for clustering and anomaly detection. Due to the large variety of perspectives and types within business process data, generating a good representation is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for representation learning of business process instances which can process and combine most perspectives in an event log. In conjunction with a self-supervised pre-training method, we show the capabilities of the approach through a visualization of the representation space and case retrieval. Furthermore, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to multiple process prediction tasks and demonstrates its effectiveness in comparison with existing approaches.\n",
      "Mutual information maximization provides an appealing formalism for learning representations of data. In the context of reinforcement learning (RL), such representations can accelerate learning by discarding irrelevant and redundant information, while retaining the information necessary for control. Much of the prior work on these methods has addressed the practical difficulties of estimating mutual information from samples of high-dimensional observations, while comparatively less is understood about which mutual information objectives yield representations that are sufficient for RL from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we formalize the sufficiency of a state representation for learning and representing the optimal policy, and study several popular mutual-information based objectives through this lens. Surprisingly, we find that two of these objectives can yield insufficient representations given mild and common assumptions on the structure of the MDP. We corroborate our theoretical results with empirical experiments on a simulated game environment with visual observations.\n",
      "High-dimensional observations are a major challenge in the application of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to real-world environments. To handle high-dimensional sensory inputs, existing approaches use representation learning to map high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional latent space that is more amenable to dynamics estimation and planning. In this work, we present an information-theoretic approach that employs temporal predictive coding to encode elements in the environment that can be predicted across time. Since this approach focuses on encoding temporally-predictable information, we implicitly prioritize the encoding of task-relevant components over nuisance information within the environment that are provably task-irrelevant. By learning this representation in conjunction with a recurrent state space model, we can then perform planning in latent space. We evaluate our model on a challenging modification of standard DMControl tasks where the background is replaced with natural videos that contain complex but irrelevant information to the planning task. Our experiments show that our model is superior to existing methods in the challenging complex-background setting while remaining competitive with current state-of-the-art models in the standard setting.\n",
      "While the advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has greatly improved node and graph representation learning in many applications, the neighborhood aggregation scheme exposes additional vulnerabilities to adversaries seeking to extract node-level information about sensitive attributes. In this paper, we study the problem of protecting sensitive attributes by information obfuscation when learning with graph structured data. We propose a framework to locally filter out pre-determined sensitive attributes via adversarial training with the total variation and the Wasserstein distance. Our method creates a strong defense against inference attacks, while only suffering small loss in task performance. Theoretically, we analyze the effectiveness of our framework against a worst-case adversary, and characterize an inherent trade-off between maximizing predictive accuracy and minimizing information leakage. Experiments across multiple datasets from recommender systems, knowledge graphs and quantum chemistry demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a robust defense across various graph structures and tasks, while producing competitive GNN encoders for downstream tasks.\n",
      "In representation learning, there has been recent interest in developing algorithms to disentangle the ground-truth generative factors behind a dataset, and metrics to quantify how fully this occurs. However, these algorithms and metrics often assume that both representations and ground-truth factors are flat, continuous, and factorized, whereas many real-world generative processes involve rich hierarchical structure, mixtures of discrete and continuous variables with dependence between them, and even varying intrinsic dimensionality. In this work, we develop benchmarks, algorithms, and metrics for learning such hierarchical representations.\n",
      "Learning node representations that incorporate information from graph structure benefits wide range of tasks on graph. The majority of existing graph neural networks (GNNs) have limited power in capturing position information for a given node. The idea of positioning nodes with selected anchors has been exploited, yet mainly relying on explicit labeling of distance information. Here we propose Graph Inference Representation (GIR), an anchor based GNN model encoding path information related to pre-selected anchors for each node. Abilities to get position-aware embeddings are theoretically and experimentally investigated on GIR and its core variants. Further, the complementarity between GIRs and typical GNNs is demonstrated. We show that GIRs get outperformed results in position-aware scenarios, and performances on typical GNNs could be improved by fusing GIR embeddings.\n",
      "Unsupervised representation learning has recently received lots of interest due to its powerful generalizability through effectively leveraging large-scale unlabeled data. There are two prevalent approaches for this, contrastive learning and generative pre-training, where the former learns representations from instance-wise discrimination tasks and the latter learns them from estimating the likelihood. These seemingly orthogonal approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses. Contrastive learning tends to extract semantic information and discards details irrelevant for classifying objects, making the representations effective for discriminative tasks while degrading robustness to out-of-distribution data. On the other hand, the generative pre-training directly estimates the data distribution, so the representations tend to be robust but not optimal for discriminative tasks. In this paper, we show that we could achieve the best of both worlds by a hybrid training scheme. Specifically, we demonstrated that a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture trained with both contrastive and generative losses can learn highly discriminative and robust representations without hurting the generative performance. We extensively validate our approach on various tasks.\n",
      "We study Policy-extended Value Function Approximator (PeVFA) in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which extends conventional value function approximator (VFA) to take as input not only the state (and action) but also an explicit policy representation. Such an extension enables PeVFA to preserve values of multiple policies at the same time and brings an appealing characteristic, i.e., \\emph{value generalization among policies}. We formally analyze the value generalization under Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI). From theoretical and empirical lens, we show that generalized value estimates offered by PeVFA may have lower initial approximation error to true values of successive policies, which is expected to improve consecutive value approximation during GPI. Based on above clues, we introduce a new form of GPI with PeVFA which leverages the value generalization along policy improvement path. Moreover, we propose a representation learning framework for RL policy, providing several approaches to learn effective policy embeddings from policy network parameters or state-action pairs. In our experiments, we evaluate the efficacy of value generalization offered by PeVFA and policy representation learning in several OpenAI Gym continuous control tasks. For a representative instance of algorithm implementation, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) re-implemented under the paradigm of GPI with PeVFA achieves about 40\\% performance improvement on its vanilla counterpart in most environments.\n",
      "Fair representation learning is an attractive approach that promises fairness of downstream predictors by encoding sensitive data. Unfortunately, recent work has shown that strong adversarial predictors can still exhibit unfairness by recovering sensitive attributes from these representations. In this work, we present Fair Normalizing Flows (FNF), a new approach offering more rigorous fairness guarantees for learned representations. Specifically, we consider a practical setting where we can estimate the probability density for sensitive groups. The key idea is to model the encoder as a normalizing flow trained to minimize the statistical distance between the latent representations of different groups. The main advantage of FNF is that its exact likelihood computation allows us to obtain guarantees on the maximum unfairness of any potentially adversarial downstream predictor. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of FNF in enforcing various group fairness notions, as well as other attractive properties such as interpretability and transfer learning, on a variety of challenging real-world datasets.\n",
      "Independent component analysis provides a principled framework for unsupervised representation learning, with solid theory on the identifiability of the latent code that generated the data, given only observations of mixtures thereof. Unfortunately, when the mixing is nonlinear, the model is provably nonidentifiable, since statistical independence alone does not sufficiently constrain the problem. Identifiability can be recovered in settings where additional, typically observed variables are included in the generative process. We investigate an alternative path and consider instead including assumptions reflecting the principle of independent causal mechanisms exploited in the field of causality. Specifically, our approach is motivated by thinking of each source as independently influencing the mixing process. This gives rise to a framework which we term independent mechanism analysis. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that our approach circumvents a number of nonidentifiability issues arising in nonlinear blind source separation.\n",
      "Self-supervised representation learning has shown remarkable success in a number of domains. A common practice is to perform data augmentation via hand-crafted transformations intended to leave the semantics of the data invariant. We seek to understand the empirical success of this approach from a theoretical perspective. We formulate the augmentation process as a latent variable model by postulating a partition of the latent representation into a content component, which is assumed invariant to augmentation, and a style component, which is allowed to change. Unlike prior work on disentanglement and independent component analysis, we allow for both nontrivial statistical and causal dependencies in the latent space. We study the identifiability of the latent representation based on pairs of views of the observations and prove sufficient conditions that allow us to identify the invariant content partition up to an invertible mapping in both generative and discriminative settings. We find numerical simulations with dependent latent variables are consistent with our theory. Lastly, we introduce Causal3DIdent, a dataset of high-dimensional, visually complex images with rich causal dependencies, which we use to study the effect of data augmentations performed in practice.\n",
      "We study neural-linear bandits for solving problems where {\\em both} exploration and representation learning play an important role. Neural-linear bandits harnesses the representation power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and combines it with efficient exploration mechanisms by leveraging uncertainty estimation of the model, designed for linear contextual bandits on top of the last hidden layer. In order to mitigate the problem of representation change during the process, new uncertainty estimations are computed using stored data from an unlimited buffer. Nevertheless, when the amount of stored data is limited, a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting emerges. To alleviate this, we propose a likelihood matching algorithm that is resilient to catastrophic forgetting and is completely online. We applied our algorithm, Limited Memory Neural-Linear with Likelihood Matching (NeuralLinear-LiM2) on a variety of datasets and observed that our algorithm achieves comparable performance to the unlimited memory approach while exhibits resilience to catastrophic forgetting.\n",
      "Unsupervised multi-object representation learning depends on inductive biases to guide the discovery of object-centric representations that generalize. However, we observe that methods for learning these representations are either impractical due to long training times and large memory consumption or forego key inductive biases. In this work, we introduce EfficientMORL, an efficient framework for the unsupervised learning of object-centric representations. We show that optimization challenges caused by requiring both symmetry and disentanglement can in fact be addressed by high-cost iterative amortized inference by designing the framework to minimize its dependence on it. We take a two-stage approach to inference: first, a hierarchical variational autoencoder extracts symmetric and disentangled representations through bottom-up inference, and second, a lightweight network refines the representations with top-down feedback. The number of refinement steps taken during training is reduced following a curriculum, so that at test time with zero steps the model achieves 99.1% of the refined decomposition performance. We demonstrate strong object decomposition and disentanglement on the standard multi-object benchmark while achieving nearly an order of magnitude faster training and test time inference over the previous state-of-the-art model.\n",
      "We introduce the forward-backward (FB) representation of the dynamics of a reward-free Markov decision process. It provides explicit near-optimal policies for any reward specified a posteriori. During an unsupervised phase, we use reward-free interactions with the environment to learn two representations via off-the-shelf deep learning methods and temporal difference (TD) learning. In the test phase, a reward representation is estimated either from observations or an explicit reward description (e.g., a target state). The optimal policy for that reward is directly obtained from these representations, with no planning. We assume access to an exploration scheme or replay buffer for the first phase.   The unsupervised FB loss is well-principled: if training is perfect, the policies obtained are provably optimal for any reward function. With imperfect training, the sub-optimality is proportional to the unsupervised approximation error. The FB representation learns long-range relationships between states and actions, via a predictive occupancy map, without having to synthesize states as in model-based approaches.   This is a step towards learning controllable agents in arbitrary black-box stochastic environments. This approach compares well to goal-oriented RL algorithms on discrete and continuous mazes, pixel-based MsPacman, and the FetchReach virtual robot arm. We also illustrate how the agent can immediately adapt to new tasks beyond goal-oriented RL.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective models for representation learning on relational data. However, standard GNNs are limited in their expressive power, as they cannot distinguish graphs beyond the capability of the Weisfeiler-Leman graph isomorphism heuristic. In order to break this expressiveness barrier, GNNs have been enhanced with random node initialization (RNI), where the idea is to train and run the models with randomized initial node features. In this work, we analyze the expressive power of GNNs with RNI, and prove that these models are universal, a first such result for GNNs not relying on computationally demanding higher-order properties. This universality result holds even with partially randomized initial node features, and preserves the invariance properties of GNNs in expectation. We then empirically analyze the effect of RNI on GNNs, based on carefully constructed datasets. Our empirical findings support the superior performance of GNNs with RNI over standard GNNs.\n",
      "State representation learning (SRL) in partially observable Markov decision processes has been studied to learn abstract features of data useful for robot control tasks. For SRL, acquiring domain-agnostic states is essential for achieving efficient imitation learning. Without these states, imitation learning is hampered by domain-dependent information useless for control. However, existing methods fail to remove such disturbances from the states when the data from experts and agents show large domain shifts. To overcome this issue, we propose a domain-adversarial and conditional state space model (DAC-SSM) that enables control systems to obtain domain-agnostic and task- and dynamics-aware states. DAC-SSM jointly optimizes the state inference, observation reconstruction, forward dynamics, and reward models. To remove domain-dependent information from the states, the model is trained with domain discriminators in an adversarial manner, and the reconstruction is conditioned on domain labels. We experimentally evaluated the model predictive control performance via imitation learning for continuous control of sparse reward tasks in simulators and compared it with the performance of the existing SRL method. The agents from DAC-SSM achieved performance comparable to experts and more than twice the baselines. We conclude domain-agnostic states are essential for imitation learning that has large domain shifts and can be obtained using DAC-SSM.\n",
      "A highly desirable property of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent -- and a major difficulty for deep RL approaches -- is the ability to generalize policies learned on a few tasks over a high-dimensional observation space to similar tasks not seen during training. Many promising approaches to this challenge consider RL as a process of training two functions simultaneously: a complex nonlinear encoder that maps high-dimensional observations to a latent representation space, and a simple linear policy over this space. We posit that a superior encoder for zero-shot generalization in RL can be trained by using solely an auxiliary SSL objective if the training process encourages the encoder to map behaviorally similar observations to similar representations, as reward-based signal can cause overfitting in the encoder (Raileanu et al., 2021). We propose Cross-Trajectory Representation Learning (CTRL), a method that runs within an RL agent and conditions its encoder to recognize behavioral similarity in observations by applying a novel SSL objective to pairs of trajectories from the agent's policies. CTRL can be viewed as having the same effect as inducing a pseudo-bisimulation metric but, crucially, avoids the use of rewards and associated overfitting risks. Our experiments ablate various components of CTRL and demonstrate that in combination with PPO it achieves better generalization performance on the challenging Procgen benchmark suite (Cobbe et al., 2020).\n",
      "Current deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches incorporate minimal prior knowledge about the environment, limiting computational and sample efficiency. \\textit{Objects} provide a succinct and causal description of the world, and many recent works have proposed unsupervised object representation learning using priors and losses over static object properties like visual consistency. However, object dynamics and interactions are also critical cues for objectness. In this paper we propose a framework for reasoning about object dynamics and behavior to rapidly determine minimal and task-specific object representations. To demonstrate the need to reason over object behavior and dynamics, we introduce a suite of RGBD MuJoCo object collection and avoidance tasks that, while intuitive and visually simple, confound state-of-the-art unsupervised object representation learning algorithms. We also highlight the potential of this framework on several Atari games, using our object representation and standard RL and planning algorithms to learn dramatically faster than existing deep RL algorithms.\n",
      "In this paper we present a novel method for learning hierarchical representations of Markov decision processes. Our method works by partitioning the state space into subsets, and defines subtasks for performing transitions between the partitions. We formulate the problem of partitioning the state space as an optimization problem that can be solved using gradient descent given a set of sampled trajectories, making our method suitable for high-dimensional problems with large state spaces. We empirically validate the method, by showing that it can successfully learn a useful hierarchical representation in a navigation domain. Once learned, the hierarchical representation can be used to solve different tasks in the given domain, thus generalizing knowledge across tasks.\n",
      "Learning to reach goal states and learning diverse skills through mutual information (MI) maximization have been proposed as principled frameworks for self-supervised reinforcement learning, allowing agents to acquire broadly applicable multitask policies with minimal reward engineering. Starting from a simple observation that the standard goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) is encapsulated by the optimization objective of variational empowerment, we discuss how GCRL and MI-based RL can be generalized into a single family of methods, which we name variational GCRL (VGCRL), interpreting variational MI maximization, or variational empowerment, as representation learning methods that acquire functionally-aware state representations for goal reaching. This novel perspective allows us to: (1) derive simple but unexplored variants of GCRL to study how adding small representation capacity can already expand its capabilities; (2) investigate how discriminator function capacity and smoothness determine the quality of discovered skills, or latent goals, through modifying latent dimensionality and applying spectral normalization; (3) adapt techniques such as hindsight experience replay (HER) from GCRL to MI-based RL; and lastly, (4) propose a novel evaluation metric, named latent goal reaching (LGR), for comparing empowerment algorithms with different choices of latent dimensionality and discriminator parameterization. Through principled mathematical derivations and careful experimental studies, our work lays a novel foundation from which to evaluate, analyze, and develop representation learning techniques in goal-based RL.\n",
      "Graph pooling that summaries the information in a large graph into a compact form is essential in hierarchical graph representation learning. Existing graph pooling methods either suffer from high computational complexity or cannot capture the global dependencies between graphs before and after pooling. To address the problems of existing graph pooling methods, we propose Coarsened Graph Infomax Pooling (CGIPool) that maximizes the mutual information between the input and the coarsened graph of each pooling layer to preserve graph-level dependencies. To achieve mutual information neural maximization, we apply contrastive learning and propose a self-attention-based algorithm for learning positive and negative samples. Extensive experimental results on seven datasets illustrate the superiority of CGIPool comparing to the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) serves as a successful approach to solving complex and temporally extended tasks. Recently, its success has been extended to more general settings by concurrently learning hierarchical policies and subgoal representations. However, online subgoal representation learning exacerbates the non-stationary issue of HRL and introduces challenges for exploration in high-level policy learning. In this paper, we propose a state-specific regularization that stabilizes subgoal embeddings in well-explored areas while allowing representation updates in less explored state regions. Benefiting from this stable representation, we design measures of novelty and potential for subgoals, and develop an efficient hierarchical exploration strategy that actively seeks out new promising subgoals and states. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control tasks with sparse rewards and further demonstrate the stability and efficiency of the subgoal representation learning of this work, which promotes superior policy learning.\n",
      "Recent works show that mean-teaching is an effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification. However, existing methods perform contrastive learning on selected samples between teacher and student networks, which is sensitive to noises in pseudo labels and neglects the relationship among most samples. Moreover, these methods are not effective in cooperation of different teacher networks. To handle these issues, this paper proposes a Graph Consistency based Mean-Teaching (GCMT) method with constructing the Graph Consistency Constraint (GCC) between teacher and student networks. Specifically, given unlabeled training images, we apply teacher networks to extract corresponding features and further construct a teacher graph for each teacher network to describe the similarity relationships among training images. To boost the representation learning, different teacher graphs are fused to provide the supervise signal for optimizing student networks. GCMT fuses similarity relationships predicted by different teacher networks as supervision and effectively optimizes student networks with more sample relationships involved. Experiments on three datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMCreID, and MSMT17, show that proposed GCMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by clear margin. Specially, GCMT even outperforms the previous method that uses a deeper backbone. Experimental results also show that GCMT can effectively boost the performance with multiple teacher and student networks. Our code is available at https://github.com/liu-xb/GCMT .\n",
      "Unsupervised/self-supervised pre-training methods for graph representation learning have recently attracted increasing research interests, and they are shown to be able to generalize to various downstream applications. Yet, the adversarial robustness of such pre-trained graph learning models remains largely unexplored. More importantly, most existing defense techniques designed for end-to-end graph representation learning methods require pre-specified label definitions, and thus cannot be directly applied to the pre-training methods. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised defense technique to robustify pre-trained deep graph models, so that the perturbations on the input graph can be successfully identified and blocked before the model is applied to different downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce a mutual information-based measure, \\textit{graph representation vulnerability (GRV)}, to quantify the robustness of graph encoders on the representation space. We then formulate an optimization problem to learn the graph representation by carefully balancing the trade-off between the expressive power and the robustness (\\emph{i.e.}, GRV) of the graph encoder. The discrete nature of graph topology and the joint space of graph data make the optimization problem intractable to solve. To handle the above difficulty and to reduce computational expense, we further relax the problem and thus provide an approximate solution. Additionally, we explore a provable connection between the robustness of the unsupervised graph encoder and that of models on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even without access to labels and tasks, our model is still able to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks on three downstream tasks (node classification, link prediction, and community detection) by an average of +16.5% compared with existing methods.\n",
      "Agents trained by reinforcement learning (RL) often fail to generalize beyond the environment they were trained in, even when presented with new scenarios that seem similar to the training environment. We study the query complexity required to train RL agents that generalize to multiple environments. Intuitively, tractable generalization is only possible when the environments are similar or close in some sense. To capture this, we introduce Weak Proximity, a natural structural condition that requires the environments to have highly similar transition and reward functions and share a policy providing optimal value. Despite such shared structure, we prove that tractable generalization is impossible in the worst case. This holds even when each individual environment can be efficiently solved to obtain an optimal linear policy, and when the agent possesses a generative model. Our lower bound applies to the more complex task of representation learning for the purpose of efficient generalization to multiple environments. On the positive side, we introduce Strong Proximity, a strengthened condition which we prove is sufficient for efficient generalization.\n",
      "In imitation learning, it is common to learn a behavior policy to match an unknown target policy via max-likelihood training on a collected set of target demonstrations. In this work, we consider using offline experience datasets - potentially far from the target distribution - to learn low-dimensional state representations that provably accelerate the sample-efficiency of downstream imitation learning. A central challenge in this setting is that the unknown target policy itself may not exhibit low-dimensional behavior, and so there is a potential for the representation learning objective to alias states in which the target policy acts differently. Circumventing this challenge, we derive a representation learning objective which provides an upper bound on the performance difference between the target policy and a lowdimensional policy trained with max-likelihood, and this bound is tight regardless of whether the target policy itself exhibits low-dimensional structure. Moving to the practicality of our method, we show that our objective can be implemented as contrastive learning, in which the transition dynamics are approximated by either an implicit energy-based model or, in some special cases, an implicit linear model with representations given by random Fourier features. Experiments on both tabular environments and high-dimensional Atari games provide quantitative evidence for the practical benefits of our proposed objective.\n",
      "We investigate the discounting mismatch in actor-critic algorithm implementations from a representation learning perspective. Theoretically, actor-critic algorithms usually have discounting for both actor and critic, i.e., there is a $\\gamma^t$ term in the actor update for the transition observed at time $t$ in a trajectory and the critic is a discounted value function. Practitioners, however, usually ignore the discounting ($\\gamma^t$) for the actor while using a discounted critic. We investigate this mismatch in two scenarios. In the first scenario, we consider optimizing an undiscounted objective $(\\gamma = 1)$ where $\\gamma^t$ disappears naturally $(1^t = 1)$. We then propose to interpret the discounting in critic in terms of a bias-variance-representation trade-off and provide supporting empirical results. In the second scenario, we consider optimizing a discounted objective ($\\gamma < 1$) and propose to interpret the omission of the discounting in the actor update from an auxiliary task perspective and provide supporting empirical results.\n",
      "Recent work on explainable clustering allows describing clusters when the features are interpretable. However, much modern machine learning focuses on complex data such as images, text, and graphs where deep learning is used but the raw features of data are not interpretable. This paper explores a novel setting for performing clustering on complex data while simultaneously generating explanations using interpretable tags. We propose deep descriptive clustering that performs sub-symbolic representation learning on complex data while generating explanations based on symbolic data. We form good clusters by maximizing the mutual information between empirical distribution on the inputs and the induced clustering labels for clustering objectives. We generate explanations by solving an integer linear programming that generates concise and orthogonal descriptions for each cluster. Finally, we allow the explanation to inform better clustering by proposing a novel pairwise loss with self-generated constraints to maximize the clustering and explanation module's consistency. Experimental results on public data demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive baselines in clustering performance while offering high-quality cluster-level explanations.\n",
      "Graph representation learning has attracted increasing research attention. However, most existing studies fuse all structural features and node attributes to provide an overarching view of graphs, neglecting finer substructures' semantics, and suffering from interpretation enigmas. This paper presents a novel hierarchical subgraph-level selection and embedding based graph neural network for graph classification, namely SUGAR, to learn more discriminative subgraph representations and respond in an explanatory way. SUGAR reconstructs a sketched graph by extracting striking subgraphs as the representative part of the original graph to reveal subgraph-level patterns. To adaptively select striking subgraphs without prior knowledge, we develop a reinforcement pooling mechanism, which improves the generalization ability of the model. To differentiate subgraph representations among graphs, we present a self-supervised mutual information mechanism to encourage subgraph embedding to be mindful of the global graph structural properties by maximizing their mutual information. Extensive experiments on six typical bioinformatics datasets demonstrate a significant and consistent improvement in model quality with competitive performance and interpretability.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Deep Clustering and multi-manifold Representation Learning (DCRL) that preserves the geometric structure of data. In the proposed framework, manifold clustering is done in the latent space guided by a clustering loss. To overcome the problem that clustering-oriented losses may deteriorate the geometric structure of embeddings in the latent space, an isometric loss is proposed for preserving intra-manifold structure locally and a ranking loss for inter-manifold structure globally. Experimental results on various datasets show that DCRL leads to performances comparable to current state-of-the-art deep clustering algorithms, yet exhibits superior performance for manifold representation. Our results also demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of the proposed losses in preserving geometric structure in terms of visualization and performance metrics.\n",
      "Time-series representation learning is a fundamental task for time-series analysis. While significant progress has been made to achieve accurate representations for downstream applications, the learned representations often lack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from previous efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the semantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized representation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled representation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of learning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored due to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex temporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret, 2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable semantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of individuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a novel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically, to generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and disentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level disentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group semantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL vanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while preserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL to keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by DTS achieve superior performance in downstream applications, with high interpretability of semantic concepts.\n",
      "First-person object-interaction tasks in high-fidelity, 3D, simulated environments such as the AI2Thor virtual home-environment pose significant sample-efficiency challenges for reinforcement learning (RL) agents learning from sparse task rewards. To alleviate these challenges, prior work has provided extensive supervision via a combination of reward-shaping, ground-truth object-information, and expert demonstrations. In this work, we show that one can learn object-interaction tasks from scratch without supervision by learning an attentive object-model as an auxiliary task during task learning with an object-centric relational RL agent. Our key insight is that learning an object-model that incorporates object-attention into forward prediction provides a dense learning signal for unsupervised representation learning of both objects and their relationships. This, in turn, enables faster policy learning for an object-centric relational RL agent. We demonstrate our agent by introducing a set of challenging object-interaction tasks in the AI2Thor environment where learning with our attentive object-model is key to strong performance. Specifically, we compare our agent and relational RL agents with alternative auxiliary tasks to a relational RL agent equipped with ground-truth object-information, and show that learning with our object-model best closes the performance gap in terms of both learning speed and maximum success rate. Additionally, we find that incorporating object-attention into an object-model's forward predictions is key to learning representations which capture object-category and object-state.\n",
      "Dynamic graph modeling has recently attracted much attention due to its extensive applications in many real-world scenarios, such as recommendation systems, financial transactions, and social networks. Although many works have been proposed for dynamic graph modeling in recent years, effective and scalable models are yet to be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network approach, called TCL, which deals with the dynamically-evolving graph in a continuous-time fashion and enables effective dynamic node representation learning that captures both the temporal and topology information. Technically, our model contains three novel aspects. First, we generalize the vanilla Transformer to temporal graph learning scenarios and design a graph-topology-aware transformer. Secondly, on top of the proposed graph transformer, we introduce a two-stream encoder that separately extracts representations from temporal neighborhoods associated with the two interaction nodes and then utilizes a co-attentional transformer to model inter-dependencies at a semantic level. Lastly, we are inspired by the recently developed contrastive learning and propose to optimize our model by maximizing mutual information (MI) between the predictive representations of two future interaction nodes. Benefiting from this, our dynamic representations can preserve high-level (or global) semantics about interactions and thus is robust to noisy interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply contrastive learning to representation learning on dynamic graphs. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets for interaction prediction and experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our model.\n",
      "We systematically evaluate the performance of deep learning models in the presence of diseases not labeled for or present during training. First, we evaluate whether deep learning models trained on a subset of diseases (seen diseases) can detect the presence of any one of a larger set of diseases. We find that models tend to falsely classify diseases outside of the subset (unseen diseases) as \"no disease\". Second, we evaluate whether models trained on seen diseases can detect seen diseases when co-occurring with diseases outside the subset (unseen diseases). We find that models are still able to detect seen diseases even when co-occurring with unseen diseases. Third, we evaluate whether feature representations learned by models may be used to detect the presence of unseen diseases given a small labeled set of unseen diseases. We find that the penultimate layer of the deep neural network provides useful features for unseen disease detection. Our results can inform the safe clinical deployment of deep learning models trained on a non-exhaustive set of disease classes.\n",
      "In an effort to overcome limitations of reward-driven feature learning in deep reinforcement learning (RL) from images, we propose decoupling representation learning from policy learning. To this end, we introduce a new unsupervised learning (UL) task, called Augmented Temporal Contrast (ATC), which trains a convolutional encoder to associate pairs of observations separated by a short time difference, under image augmentations and using a contrastive loss. In online RL experiments, we show that training the encoder exclusively using ATC matches or outperforms end-to-end RL in most environments. Additionally, we benchmark several leading UL algorithms by pre-training encoders on expert demonstrations and using them, with weights frozen, in RL agents; we find that agents using ATC-trained encoders outperform all others. We also train multi-task encoders on data from multiple environments and show generalization to different downstream RL tasks. Finally, we ablate components of ATC, and introduce a new data augmentation to enable replay of (compressed) latent images from pre-trained encoders when RL requires augmentation. Our experiments span visually diverse RL benchmarks in DeepMind Control, DeepMind Lab, and Atari, and our complete code is available at https://github.com/astooke/rlpyt/tree/master/rlpyt/ul.\n",
      "Recent self-supervised methods for image representation learning are based on maximizing the agreement between embedding vectors from different views of the same image. A trivial solution is obtained when the encoder outputs constant vectors. This collapse problem is often avoided through implicit biases in the learning architecture, that often lack a clear justification or interpretation. In this paper, we introduce VICReg (Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization), a method that explicitly avoids the collapse problem with a simple regularization term on the variance of the embeddings along each dimension individually. VICReg combines the variance term with a decorrelation mechanism based on redundancy reduction and covariance regularization, and achieves results on par with the state of the art on several downstream tasks. In addition, we show that incorporating our new variance term into other methods helps stabilize the training and leads to performance improvements.\n",
      "We present PSEUDo, an adaptive feature learning technique for exploring visual patterns in multi-track sequential data. Our approach is designed with the primary focus to overcome the uneconomic retraining requirements and inflexible representation learning in current deep learning-based systems. Multi-track time series data are generated on an unprecedented scale due to increased sensors and data storage. These datasets hold valuable patterns, like in neuromarketing, where researchers try to link patterns in multivariate sequential data from physiological sensors to the purchase behavior of products and services. But a lack of ground truth and high variance make automatic pattern detection unreliable. Our advancements are based on a novel query-aware locality-sensitive hashing technique to create a feature-based representation of multivariate time series windows. Most importantly, our algorithm features sub-linear training and inference time. We can even accomplish both the modeling and comparison of 10,000 different 64-track time series, each with 100 time steps (a typical EEG dataset) under 0.8 seconds. This performance gain allows for a rapid relevance feedback-driven adaption of the underlying pattern similarity model and enables the user to modify the speed-vs-accuracy trade-off gradually. We demonstrate superiority of PSEUDo in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and steerability through a quantitative performance comparison and a qualitative visual quality comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms in the field. Moreover, we showcase the usability of PSEUDo through a case study demonstrating our visual pattern retrieval concepts in a large meteorological dataset. We find that our adaptive models can accurately capture the user's notion of similarity and allow for an understandable exploratory visual pattern retrieval in large multivariate time series datasets.\n",
      "Face representation learning using datasets with massive number of identities requires appropriate training methods. Softmax-based approach, currently the state-of-the-art in face recognition, in its usual \"full softmax\" form is not suitable for datasets with millions of persons. Several methods, based on the \"sampled softmax\" approach, were proposed to remove this limitation. These methods, however, have a set of disadvantages. One of them is a problem of \"prototype obsolescence\": classifier weights (prototypes) of the rarely sampled classes, receive too scarce gradients and become outdated and detached from the current encoder state, resulting in an incorrect training signals. This problem is especially serious in ultra-large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel face representation learning model called Prototype Memory, which alleviates this problem and allows training on a dataset of any size. Prototype Memory consists of the limited-size memory module for storing recent class prototypes and employs a set of algorithms to update it in appropriate way. New class prototypes are generated on the fly using exemplar embeddings in the current mini-batch. These prototypes are enqueued to the memory and used in a role of classifier weights for usual softmax classification-based training. To prevent obsolescence and keep the memory in close connection with encoder, prototypes are regularly refreshed, and oldest ones are dequeued and disposed. Prototype Memory is computationally efficient and independent of dataset size. It can be used with various loss functions, hard example mining algorithms and encoder architectures. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed model by extensive experiments on popular face recognition benchmarks.\n",
      "Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of research interests and applications of machine learning on graphs. Automated machine learning (AutoML) on graphs is on the horizon to automatically design the optimal machine learning algorithm for a given graph task. However, none of the existing libraries can fully support AutoML on graphs. To fill this gap, we present Automated Graph Learning (AutoGL), the first library for automated machine learning on graphs. AutoGL is open-source, easy to use, and flexible to be extended. Specifically, we propose an automated machine learning pipeline for graph data containing four modules: auto feature engineering, model training, hyper-parameter optimization, and auto ensemble. For each module, we provide numerous state-of-the-art methods and flexible base classes and APIs, which allow easy customization. We further provide experimental results to showcase the usage of our AutoGL library.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received significant attention due to their state-of-the-art performance on various graph representation learning tasks. However, recent studies reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e. an attacker is able to fool the GNNs by perturbing the graph structure or node features deliberately. While being able to successfully decrease the performance of GNNs, most existing attacking algorithms require access to either the model parameters or the training data, which is not practical in the real world.   In this paper, we develop deeper insights into the Mettack algorithm, which is a representative grey-box attacking method, and then we propose a gradient-based black-box attacking algorithm. Firstly, we show that the Mettack algorithm will perturb the edges unevenly, thus the attack will be highly dependent on a specific training set. As a result, a simple yet useful strategy to defense against Mettack is to train the GNN with the validation set. Secondly, to overcome the drawbacks, we propose the Black-Box Gradient Attack (BBGA) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that out proposed method is able to achieve stable attack performance without accessing the training sets of the GNNs. Further results shows that our proposed method is also applicable when attacking against various defense methods.\n",
      "We present a large-scale study on unsupervised spatiotemporal representation learning from videos. With a unified perspective on four recent image-based frameworks, we study a simple objective that can easily generalize all these methods to space-time. Our objective encourages temporally-persistent features in the same video, and in spite of its simplicity, it works surprisingly well across: (i) different unsupervised frameworks, (ii) pre-training datasets, (iii) downstream datasets, and (iv) backbone architectures. We draw a series of intriguing observations from this study, e.g., we discover that encouraging long-spanned persistency can be effective even if the timespan is 60 seconds. In addition to state-of-the-art results in multiple benchmarks, we report a few promising cases in which unsupervised pre-training can outperform its supervised counterpart.

      "Ultra-wideband (UWB) is the state-of-the-art and most popular technology for wireless localization. Nevertheless, precise ranging and localization in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions is still an open research topic. Indeed, multipath effects, reflections, refractions, and complexity of the indoor radio environment can easily introduce a positive bias in the ranging measurement, resulting in highly inaccurate and unsatisfactory position estimation. This article proposes an efficient representation learning methodology that exploits the latest advancement in deep learning and graph optimization techniques to achieve effective ranging error mitigation at the edge. Channel Impulse Response (CIR) signals are directly exploited to extract high semantic features to estimate corrections in either NLoS or LoS conditions. Extensive experimentation with different settings and configurations has proved the effectiveness of our methodology and demonstrated the feasibility of a robust and low computational power UWB range error mitigation.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful inductive bias for modelling algorithmic reasoning procedures and data structures. Their prowess was mainly demonstrated on tasks featuring Markovian dynamics, where querying any associated data structure depends only on its latest state. For many tasks of interest, however, it may be highly beneficial to support efficient data structure queries dependent on previous states. This requires tracking the data structure's evolution through time, placing significant pressure on the GNN's latent representations. We introduce Persistent Message Passing (PMP), a mechanism which endows GNNs with capability of querying past state by explicitly persisting it: rather than overwriting node representations, it creates new nodes whenever required. PMP generalises out-of-distribution to more than 2x larger test inputs on dynamic temporal range queries, significantly outperforming GNNs which overwrite states.\n",
      "For many of the 700 million illiterate people around the world, speech recognition technology could provide a bridge to valuable information and services. Yet, those most in need of this technology are often the most underserved by it. In many countries, illiterate people tend to speak only low-resource languages, for which the datasets necessary for speech technology development are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised speech representation learning on noisy radio broadcasting archives, which are abundant even in low-resource languages. We make three core contributions. First, we release two datasets to the research community. The first, West African Radio Corpus, contains 142 hours of audio in more than 10 languages with a labeled validation subset. The second, West African Virtual Assistant Speech Recognition Corpus, consists of 10K labeled audio clips in four languages. Next, we share West African wav2vec, a speech encoder trained on the noisy radio corpus, and compare it with the baseline Facebook speech encoder trained on six times more data of higher quality. We show that West African wav2vec performs similarly to the baseline on a multilingual speech recognition task, and significantly outperforms the baseline on a West African language identification task. Finally, we share the first-ever speech recognition models for Maninka, Pular and Susu, languages spoken by a combined 10 million people in over seven countries, including six where the majority of the adult population is illiterate. Our contributions offer a path forward for ethical AI research to serve the needs of those most disadvantaged by the digital divide.\n",
      "Unsupervised attributed graph representation learning is challenging since both structural and feature information are required to be represented in the latent space. Existing methods concentrate on learning latent representation via reconstruction tasks, but cannot directly optimize representation and are prone to oversmoothing, thus limiting the applications on downstream tasks. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel graph embedding framework named Deep Manifold Attributed Graph Embedding (DMAGE). A node-to-node geodesic similarity is proposed to compute the inter-node similarity between the data space and the latent space and then use Bergman divergence as loss function to minimize the difference between them. We then design a new network structure with fewer aggregation to alleviate the oversmoothing problem and incorporate graph structure augmentation to improve the representation's stability. Our proposed DMAGE surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on three downstream tasks: unsupervised visualization, node clustering, and link prediction across four popular datasets.\n",
      "Several regularization methods have recently been introduced which force the latent activations of an autoencoder or deep neural network to conform to either a Gaussian or hyperspherical distribution, or to minimize the implicit rank of the distribution in latent space. In the present work, we introduce a novel regularizing loss function which simulates a pairwise repulsive force between items and an attractive force of each item toward the origin. We show that minimizing this loss function in isolation achieves a hyperspherical distribution. Moreover, when used as a regularizing term, the scaling factor can be adjusted to allow greater flexibility and tolerance of eccentricity, thus allowing the latent variables to be stratified according to their relative importance, while still promoting diversity. We apply this method of Eccentric Regularization to an autoencoder, and demonstrate its effectiveness in image generation, representation learning and downstream classification tasks.\n",
      "Having access to multi-modal cues (e.g. vision and audio) empowers some cognitive tasks to be done faster compared to learning from a single modality. In this work, we propose to transfer knowledge across heterogeneous modalities, even though these data modalities may not be semantically correlated. Rather than directly aligning the representations of different modalities, we compose audio, image, and video representations across modalities to uncover richer multi-modal knowledge. Our main idea is to learn a compositional embedding that closes the cross-modal semantic gap and captures the task-relevant semantics, which facilitates pulling together representations across modalities by compositional contrastive learning. We establish a new, comprehensive multi-modal distillation benchmark on three video datasets: UCF101, ActivityNet, and VGGSound. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms a variety of existing knowledge distillation methods in transferring audio-visual knowledge to improve video representation learning.

      "Homography estimation is often an indispensable step in many computer vision tasks. The existing approaches, however, are not robust to illumination and/or larger viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose bidirectional implicit Homography Estimation (biHomE) loss for unsupervised homography estimation. biHomE minimizes the distance in the feature space between the warped image from the source viewpoint and the corresponding image from the target viewpoint. Since we use a fixed pre-trained feature extractor and the only learnable component of our framework is the homography network, we effectively decouple the homography estimation from representation learning. We use an additional photometric distortion step in the synthetic COCO dataset generation to better represent the illumination variation of the real-world scenarios. We show that biHomE achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic COCO dataset, which is also comparable or better compared to supervised approaches. Furthermore, the empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our approach to illumination variation compared to existing methods.\n",
      "Object-centric representations have recently enabled significant progress in tackling relational reasoning tasks. By building a strong object-centric inductive bias into neural architectures, recent efforts have improved generalization and data efficiency of machine learning algorithms for these problems. One problem class involving relational reasoning that still remains under-explored is multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Here we investigate whether object-centric representations are also beneficial in the fully cooperative MARL setting. Specifically, we study two ways of incorporating an agent-centric inductive bias into our RL algorithm: 1. Introducing an agent-centric attention module with explicit connections across agents 2. Adding an agent-centric unsupervised predictive objective (i.e. not using action labels), to be used as an auxiliary loss for MARL, or as the basis of a pre-training step. We evaluate these approaches on the Google Research Football environment as well as DeepMind Lab 2D. Empirically, agent-centric representation learning leads to the emergence of more complex cooperation strategies between agents as well as enhanced sample efficiency and generalization.\n",
      "Time series with missing data are signals encountered in important settings for machine learning. Some of the most successful prior approaches for modeling such time series are based on recurrent neural networks that transform the input and previous state to account for the missing observations, and then treat the transformed signal in a standard manner.   In this paper, we introduce a single unifying framework, Recursive Input and State Estimation (RISE), for this general approach and reformulate existing models as specific instances of this framework. We then explore additional novel variations within the RISE framework to improve the performance of any instance. We exploit representation learning techniques to learn latent representations of the signals used by RISE instances. We discuss and develop various encoding techniques to learn latent signal representations. We benchmark instances of the framework with various encoding functions on three data imputation datasets, observing that RISE instances always benefit from encoders that learn representations for numerical values from the digits into which they can be decomposed.\n",
      "Representation learning has significantly been developed with the advance of contrastive learning methods. Most of those methods have benefited from various data augmentations that are carefully designated to maintain their identities so that the images transformed from the same instance can still be retrieved. However, those carefully designed transformations limited us to further explore the novel patterns exposed by other transformations. Meanwhile, as found in our experiments, the strong augmentations distorted the images' structures, resulting in difficult retrieval. Thus, we propose a general framework called Contrastive Learning with Stronger Augmentations~(CLSA) to complement current contrastive learning approaches. Here, the distribution divergence between the weakly and strongly augmented images over the representation bank is adopted to supervise the retrieval of strongly augmented queries from a pool of instances. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset and downstream datasets showed the information from the strongly augmented images can significantly boost the performance. For example, CLSA achieves top-1 accuracy of 76.2% on ImageNet with a standard ResNet-50 architecture with a single-layer classifier fine-tuned, which is almost the same level as 76.5% of supervised results. The code and pre-trained models are available in https://github.com/maple-research-lab/CLSA.\n",
      "Recent work learns contextual representations of source code by reconstructing tokens from their context. For downstream semantic understanding tasks like summarizing code in English, these representations should ideally capture program functionality. However, we show that the popular reconstruction-based BERT model is sensitive to source code edits, even when the edits preserve semantics. We propose ContraCode: a contrastive pre-training task that learns code functionality, not form. ContraCode pre-trains a neural network to identify functionally similar variants of a program among many non-equivalent distractors. We scalably generate these variants using an automated source-to-source compiler as a form of data augmentation. Contrastive pre-training improves JavaScript summarization and TypeScript type inference accuracy by 2% to 13%. We also propose a new zero-shot JavaScript code clone detection dataset, showing that ContraCode is both more robust and semantically meaningful. On it, we outperform RoBERTa by 39% AUROC in an adversarial setting and up to 5% on natural code.\n",
      "Recent works for attributed network clustering utilize graph convolution to obtain node embeddings and simultaneously perform clustering assignments on the embedding space. It is effective since graph convolution combines the structural and attributive information for node embedding learning. However, a major limitation of such works is that the graph convolution only incorporates the attribute information from the local neighborhood of nodes but fails to exploit the mutual affinities between nodes and attributes. In this regard, we propose a variational co-embedding learning model for attributed network clustering (VCLANC). VCLANC is composed of dual variational auto-encoders to simultaneously embed nodes and attributes. Relying on this, the mutual affinity information between nodes and attributes could be reconstructed from the embedding space and served as extra self-supervised knowledge for representation learning. At the same time, trainable Gaussian mixture model is used as priors to infer the node clustering assignments. To strengthen the performance of the inferred clusters, we use a mutual distance loss on the centers of the Gaussian priors and a clustering assignment hardening loss on the node embeddings. Experimental results on four real-world attributed network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VCLANC for attributed network clustering.\n",
      "Drug-drug interaction(DDI) prediction is an important task in the medical health machine learning community. This study presents a new method, multi-view graph contrastive representation learning for drug-drug interaction prediction, MIRACLE for brevity, to capture inter-view molecule structure and intra-view interactions between molecules simultaneously. MIRACLE treats a DDI network as a multi-view graph where each node in the interaction graph itself is a drug molecular graph instance. We use GCNs and bond-aware attentive message passing networks to encode DDI relationships and drug molecular graphs in the MIRACLE learning stage, respectively. Also, we propose a novel unsupervised contrastive learning component to balance and integrate the multi-view information. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real datasets show that MIRACLE outperforms the state-of-the-art DDI prediction models consistently.\n",
      "Learning temporal patterns from multivariate longitudinal data is challenging especially in cases when data is sporadic, as often seen in, e.g., healthcare applications where the data can suffer from irregularity and asynchronicity as the time between consecutive data points can vary across features and samples, hindering the application of existing deep learning models that are constructed for complete, evenly spaced data with fixed sequence lengths. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based model is developed for modeling multiple temporal features in sporadic data using an integrated deep learning architecture based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) unit and a continuous-time autoregressive (CAR) model. The proposed model, called CARRNN, uses a generalized discrete-time autoregressive model that is trainable end-to-end using neural networks modulated by time lags to describe the changes caused by the irregularity and asynchronicity. It is applied to multivariate time-series regression tasks using data provided for Alzheimer's disease progression modeling and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rate prediction, where the proposed model based on a gated recurrent unit (GRU) achieves the lowest prediction errors among the proposed RNN-based models and state-of-the-art methods using GRUs and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in their architecture.\n",

Suitable classification and regression methods from the field of supervised machine learning already exist for predictive tasks, for example in the context of condition monitoring, but their performance scales strongly with the number of labeled training data. Their provision is often associated with high effort in the form of person-hours or additional sensors. In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised feature extraction using autoencoder networks that specifically addresses the heterogeneous nature of the database and reduces the amount of labeled training data required compared to existing methods. Three public datasets of mechatronic systems from different application domains are used to validate the results.\n",
      "We study how representation learning can accelerate reinforcement learning from rich observations, such as images, without relying either on domain knowledge or pixel-reconstruction. Our goal is to learn representations that both provide for effective downstream control and invariance to task-irrelevant details. Bisimulation metrics quantify behavioral similarity between states in continuous MDPs, which we propose using to learn robust latent representations which encode only the task-relevant information from observations. Our method trains encoders such that distances in latent space equal bisimulation distances in state space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at disregarding task-irrelevant information using modified visual MuJoCo tasks, where the background is replaced with moving distractors and natural videos, while achieving SOTA performance. We also test a first-person highway driving task where our method learns invariance to clouds, weather, and time of day. Finally, we provide generalization results drawn from properties of bisimulation metrics, and links to causal inference.\n",
      "We introduce a non-parametric approach for infinite video texture synthesis using a representation learned via contrastive learning. We take inspiration from Video Textures, which showed that plausible new videos could be generated from a single one by stitching its frames together in a novel yet consistent order. This classic work, however, was constrained by its use of hand-designed distance metrics, limiting its use to simple, repetitive videos. We draw on recent techniques from self-supervised learning to learn this distance metric, allowing us to compare frames in a manner that scales to more challenging dynamics, and to condition on other data, such as audio. We learn representations for video frames and frame-to-frame transition probabilities by fitting a video-specific model trained using contrastive learning. To synthesize a texture, we randomly sample frames with high transition probabilities to generate diverse temporally smooth videos with novel sequences and transitions. The model naturally extends to an audio-conditioned setting without requiring any finetuning. Our model outperforms baselines on human perceptual scores, can handle a diverse range of input videos, and can combine semantic and audio-visual cues in order to synthesize videos that synchronize well with an audio signal.\n",
      "Attaining prototypical features to represent class distributions is well established in representation learning. However, learning prototypes online from streaming data proves a challenging endeavor as they rapidly become outdated, caused by an ever-changing parameter space during the learning process. Additionally, continual learning does not assume the data stream to be stationary, typically resulting in catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. As a first, we introduce a system addressing both problems, where prototypes evolve continually in a shared latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point in time. In contrast to the major body of work in continual learning, data streams are processed in an online fashion, without additional task-information, and an efficient memory scheme provides robustness to imbalanced data streams. Besides nearest neighbor based prediction, learning is facilitated by a novel objective function, encouraging cluster density about the class prototype and increased inter-class variance. Furthermore, the latent space quality is elevated by pseudo-prototypes in each batch, constituted by replay of exemplars from memory. As an additional contribution, we generalize the existing paradigms in continual learning to incorporate data incremental learning from data streams by formalizing a two-agent learner-evaluator framework. We obtain state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin on eight benchmarks, including three highly imbalanced data streams.\n",
      "Crowd counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, which desires rich information to generate pixel-wise crowd density maps. However, most previous methods only used the limited information of RGB images and cannot well discover potential pedestrians in unconstrained scenarios. In this work, we find that incorporating optical and thermal information can greatly help to recognize pedestrians. To promote future researches in this field, we introduce a large-scale RGBT Crowd Counting (RGBT-CC) benchmark, which contains 2,030 pairs of RGB-thermal images with 138,389 annotated people. Furthermore, to facilitate the multimodal crowd counting, we propose a cross-modal collaborative representation learning framework, which consists of multiple modality-specific branches, a modality-shared branch, and an Information Aggregation-Distribution Module (IADM) to capture the complementary information of different modalities fully. Specifically, our IADM incorporates two collaborative information transfers to dynamically enhance the modality-shared and modality-specific representations with a dual information propagation mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on the RGBT-CC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for RGBT crowd counting. Moreover, the proposed approach is universal for multimodal crowd counting and is also capable to achieve superior performance on the ShanghaiTechRGBD dataset. Finally, our source code and benchmark are released at {\\url{http://lingboliu.com/RGBT_Crowd_Counting.html}}.\n",
      "Generalizable, transferrable, and robust representation learning on graph-structured data remains a challenge for current graph neural networks (GNNs). Unlike what has been developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data, self-supervised learning and pre-training are less explored for GNNs. In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) framework for learning unsupervised representations of graph data. We first design four types of graph augmentations to incorporate various priors. We then systematically study the impact of various combinations of graph augmentations on multiple datasets, in four different settings: semi-supervised, unsupervised, and transfer learning as well as adversarial attacks. The results show that, even without tuning augmentation extents nor using sophisticated GNN architectures, our GraphCL framework can produce graph representations of similar or better generalizability, transferrability, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also investigate the impact of parameterized graph augmentation extents and patterns, and observe further performance gains in preliminary experiments. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL.\n",
      "The complexity and non-Euclidean structure of graph data hinder the development of data augmentation methods similar to those in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a feature augmentation method for graph nodes based on topological regularization, in which topological structure information is introduced into end-to-end model. Specifically, we first obtain topology embedding of nodes through unsupervised representation learning method based on random walk. Then, the topological embedding as additional features and the original node features are input into a dual graph neural network for propagation, and two different high-order neighborhood representations of nodes are obtained. On this basis, we propose a regularization technique to bridge the differences between the two different node representations, eliminate the adverse effects caused by the topological features of graphs directly used, and greatly improve the performance. We have carried out extensive experiments on a large number of datasets to prove the effectiveness of our model.\n",
      "A key challenge in self-supervised video representation learning is how to effectively capture motion information besides context bias. While most existing works implicitly achieve this with video-specific pretext tasks (e.g., predicting clip orders, time arrows, and paces), we develop a method that explicitly decouples motion supervision from context bias through a carefully designed pretext task. Specifically, we take the keyframes and motion vectors in compressed videos (e.g., in H.264 format) as the supervision sources for context and motion, respectively, which can be efficiently extracted at over 500 fps on the CPU. Then we design two pretext tasks that are jointly optimized: a context matching task where a pairwise contrastive loss is cast between video clip and keyframe features; and a motion prediction task where clip features, passed through an encoder-decoder network, are used to estimate motion features in a near future. These two tasks use a shared video backbone and separate MLP heads. Experiments show that our approach improves the quality of the learned video representation over previous works, where we obtain absolute gains of 16.0% and 11.1% in video retrieval recall on UCF101 and HMDB51, respectively. Moreover, we find the motion prediction to be a strong regularization for video networks, where using it as an auxiliary task improves the accuracy of action recognition with a margin of 7.4%~13.8%.\n",
      "We present a multiview pseudo-labeling approach to video learning, a novel framework that uses complementary views in the form of appearance and motion information for semi-supervised learning in video. The complementary views help obtain more reliable pseudo-labels on unlabeled video, to learn stronger video representations than from purely supervised data. Though our method capitalizes on multiple views, it nonetheless trains a model that is shared across appearance and motion input and thus, by design, incurs no additional computation overhead at inference time. On multiple video recognition datasets, our method substantially outperforms its supervised counterpart, and compares favorably to previous work on standard benchmarks in self-supervised video representation learning.\n",
      "Modeling time-evolving knowledge graphs (KGs) has recently gained increasing interest. Here, graph representation learning has become the dominant paradigm for link prediction on temporal KGs. However, the embedding-based approaches largely operate in a black-box fashion, lacking the ability to interpret their predictions. This paper provides a link forecasting framework that reasons over query-relevant subgraphs of temporal KGs and jointly models the structural dependencies and the temporal dynamics. Especially, we propose a temporal relational attention mechanism and a novel reverse representation update scheme to guide the extraction of an enclosing subgraph around the query. The subgraph is expanded by an iterative sampling of temporal neighbors and by attention propagation. Our approach provides human-understandable evidence explaining the forecast. We evaluate our model on four benchmark temporal knowledge graphs for the link forecasting task. While being more explainable, our model obtains a relative improvement of up to 20% on Hits@1 compared to the previous best KG forecasting method. We also conduct a survey with 53 respondents, and the results show that the evidence extracted by the model for link forecasting is aligned with human understanding.\n",
      "Cluster assignment of large and complex images is a crucial but challenging task in pattern recognition and computer vision. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing fuzzy clustering in a deep neural network framework. Thus, we present a novel evolutionary unsupervised learning representation model with iterative optimization. It implements the deep adaptive fuzzy clustering (DAFC) strategy that learns a convolutional neural network classifier from given only unlabeled data samples. DAFC consists of a deep feature quality-verifying model and a fuzzy clustering model, where deep feature representation learning loss function and embedded fuzzy clustering with the weighted adaptive entropy is implemented. We joint fuzzy clustering to the deep reconstruction model, in which fuzzy membership is utilized to represent a clear structure of deep cluster assignments and jointly optimize for the deep representation learning and clustering. Also, the joint model evaluates current clustering performance by inspecting whether the re-sampled data from estimated bottleneck space have consistent clustering properties to progressively improve the deep clustering model. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets show that the proposed method obtains a substantially better performance for both reconstruction and clustering quality when compared to the other state-of-the-art deep clustering methods, as demonstrated with the in-depth analysis in the extensive experiments.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful models that have been successful in various graph representation learning tasks. Whereas gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) often outperform other machine learning methods when faced with heterogeneous tabular data. But what approach should be used for graphs with tabular node features? Previous GNN models have mostly focused on networks with homogeneous sparse features and, as we show, are suboptimal in the heterogeneous setting. In this work, we propose a novel architecture that trains GBDT and GNN jointly to get the best of both worlds: the GBDT model deals with heterogeneous features, while GNN accounts for the graph structure. Our model benefits from end-to-end optimization by allowing new trees to fit the gradient updates of GNN. With an extensive experimental comparison to the leading GBDT and GNN models, we demonstrate a significant increase in performance on a variety of graphs with tabular features.

      "We provide a construction for categorical representation learning and introduce the foundations of \"$\\textit{categorifier}$\". The central theme in representation learning is the idea of $\\textbf{everything to vector}$. Every object in a dataset $\\mathcal{S}$ can be represented as a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ by an $\\textit{encoding map}$ $E: \\mathcal{O}bj(\\mathcal{S})\\to\\mathbb{R}^n$. More importantly, every morphism can be represented as a matrix $E: \\mathcal{H}om(\\mathcal{S})\\to\\mathbb{R}^{n}_{n}$. The encoding map $E$ is generally modeled by a $\\textit{deep neural network}$. The goal of representation learning is to design appropriate tasks on the dataset to train the encoding map (assuming that an encoding is optimal if it universally optimizes the performance on various tasks). However, the latter is still a $\\textit{set-theoretic}$ approach. The goal of the current article is to promote the representation learning to a new level via a $\\textit{category-theoretic}$ approach. As a proof of concept, we provide an example of a text translator equipped with our technology, showing that our categorical learning model outperforms the current deep learning models by 17 times. The content of the current article is part of the recent US patent proposal (patent application number: 63110906).\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for representation learning on irregular data. As they generalize the operations of classical CNNs on grids to arbitrary topologies, GNNs also bring much of the implementation challenges of their Euclidean counterparts. Model size, memory footprint, and energy consumption are common concerns for many real-world applications. Network binarization allocates a single bit to parameters and activations, thus dramatically reducing the memory requirements (up to 32x compared to single-precision floating-point numbers) and maximizing the benefits of fast SIMD instructions on modern hardware for measurable speedups. However, in spite of the large body of work on binarization for classical CNNs, this area remains largely unexplored in geometric deep learning. In this paper, we present and evaluate different strategies for the binarization of graph neural networks. We show that through careful design of the models, and control of the training process, binary graph neural networks can be trained at only a moderate cost in accuracy on challenging benchmarks. In particular, we present the first dynamic graph neural network in Hamming space, able to leverage efficient k-NN search on binary vectors to speed-up the construction of the dynamic graph. We further verify that the binary models offer significant savings on embedded devices. Our code is publicly available on Github.\n",
      "Driving in a dynamic, multi-agent, and complex urban environment is a difficult task requiring a complex decision-making policy. The learning of such a policy requires a state representation that can encode the entire environment. Mid-level representations that encode a vehicle's environment as images have become a popular choice. Still, they are quite high-dimensional, limiting their use in data-hungry approaches such as reinforcement learning. In this article, we propose to learn a low-dimensional and rich latent representation of the environment by leveraging the knowledge of relevant semantic factors. To do this, we train an encoder-decoder deep neural network to predict multiple application-relevant factors such as the trajectories of other agents and the ego car. We also propose a hazard signal in addition to the learned latent representation as input to a down-stream policy. We demonstrate that using the multi-head encoder-decoder neural network results in a more informative representation than a standard single-head model. In particular, the proposed representation learning and the hazard signal help reinforcement learning to learn faster, with increased performance and less data than baseline methods.\n",
      "Mixup-based data augmentation has achieved great success as regularizer for deep neural networks. However, existing mixup methods require explicitly designed mixup policies. In this paper, we present a flexible, general Automatic Mixup (AutoMix) framework which utilizes discriminative features to learn a sample mixing policy adaptively. We regard mixup as a pretext task and split it into two sub-problems: mixed samples generation and mixup classification. To this end, we design a lightweight mix block to generate synthetic samples based on feature maps and mix labels. Since the two sub-problems are in the nature of Expectation-Maximization (EM), we also propose a momentum training pipeline to optimize the mixup process and mixup classification process alternatively in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on six popular classification benchmarks show that AutoMix consistently outperforms other leading mixup methods and improves generalization abilities to downstream tasks. We hope AutoMix will motivate the community to rethink the role of mixup in representation learning. The code will be released soon.\n",
      "Unsupervised representation learning is an important challenge in computer vision, with self-supervised learning methods recently closing the gap to supervised representation learning. An important ingredient in high-performing self-supervised methods is the use of data augmentation by training models to place different augmented views of the same image nearby in embedding space. However, commonly used augmentation pipelines treat images holistically, disregarding the semantic relevance of parts of an image-e.g. a subject vs. a background-which can lead to the learning of spurious correlations. Our work addresses this problem by investigating a class of simple, yet highly effective \"background augmentations\", which encourage models to focus on semantically-relevant content by discouraging them from focusing on image backgrounds. Background augmentations lead to substantial improvements (+1-2% on ImageNet-1k) in performance across a spectrum of state-of-the art self-supervised methods (MoCov2, BYOL, SwAV) on a variety of tasks, allowing us to reach within 0.3% of supervised performance. We also demonstrate that background augmentations improve robustness to a number of out of distribution settings, including natural adversarial examples, the backgrounds challenge, adversarial attacks, and ReaL ImageNet.\n",
      "We ask the following question: what training information is required to design an effective outlier/out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, i.e., detecting samples that lie far away from the training distribution? Since unlabeled data is easily accessible for many applications, the most compelling approach is to develop detectors based on only unlabeled in-distribution data. However, we observe that most existing detectors based on unlabeled data perform poorly, often equivalent to a random prediction. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art OOD detectors achieve impressive performance but require access to fine-grained data labels for supervised training. We propose SSD, an outlier detector based on only unlabeled in-distribution data. We use self-supervised representation learning followed by a Mahalanobis distance based detection in the feature space. We demonstrate that SSD outperforms most existing detectors based on unlabeled data by a large margin. Additionally, SSD even achieves performance on par, and sometimes even better, with supervised training based detectors. Finally, we expand our detection framework with two key extensions. First, we formulate few-shot OOD detection, in which the detector has access to only one to five samples from each class of the targeted OOD dataset. Second, we extend our framework to incorporate training data labels, if available. We find that our novel detection framework based on SSD displays enhanced performance with these extensions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/inspire-group/SSD.\n",
      "We propose methods to strengthen the invariance properties of representations obtained by contrastive learning. While existing approaches implicitly induce a degree of invariance as representations are learned, we look to more directly enforce invariance in the encoding process. To this end, we first introduce a training objective for contrastive learning that uses a novel regularizer to control how the representation changes under transformation. We show that representations trained with this objective perform better on downstream tasks and are more robust to the introduction of nuisance transformations at test time. Second, we propose a change to how test time representations are generated by introducing a feature averaging approach that combines encodings from multiple transformations of the original input, finding that this leads to across the board performance gains. Finally, we introduce the novel Spirograph dataset to explore our ideas in the context of a differentiable generative process with multiple downstream tasks, showing that our techniques for learning invariance are highly beneficial.\n",
      "In this work, we study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting in the graph representation learning scenario. The primary objective of the analysis is to understand whether classical continual learning techniques for flat and sequential data have a tangible impact on performances when applied to graph data. To do so, we experiment with a structure-agnostic model and a deep graph network in a robust and controlled environment on three different datasets. The benchmark is complemented by an investigation on the effect of structure-preserving regularization techniques on catastrophic forgetting. We find that replay is the most effective strategy in so far, which also benefits the most from the use of regularization. Our findings suggest interesting future research at the intersection of the continual and graph representation learning fields. Finally, we provide researchers with a flexible software framework to reproduce our results and carry out further experiments.\n",
      "In this paper, we focus on the problem of unsupervised image-sentence matching. Existing research explores to utilize document-level structural information to sample positive and negative instances for model training. Although the approach achieves positive results, it introduces a sampling bias and fails to distinguish instances with high semantic similarity. To alleviate the bias, we propose a new sampling strategy to select additional intra-document image-sentence pairs as positive or negative samples. Furthermore, to recognize the complex pattern in intra-document samples, we propose a Transformer based model to capture fine-grained features and implicitly construct a graph for each document, where concepts in a document are introduced to bridge the representation learning of images and sentences in the context of a document. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach to alleviate the bias and learn well-aligned multimodal representations.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning methods trained on few environments rarely learn policies that generalize to unseen environments. To improve generalization, we incorporate the inherent sequential structure in reinforcement learning into the representation learning process. This approach is orthogonal to recent approaches, which rarely exploit this structure explicitly. Specifically, we introduce a theoretically motivated policy similarity metric (PSM) for measuring behavioral similarity between states. PSM assigns high similarity to states for which the optimal policies in those states as well as in future states are similar. We also present a contrastive representation learning procedure to embed any state similarity metric, which we instantiate with PSM to obtain policy similarity embeddings (PSEs). We demonstrate that PSEs improve generalization on diverse benchmarks, including LQR with spurious correlations, a jumping task from pixels, and Distracting DM Control Suite.\n",
      "Recent works in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are actively revisiting various data augmentation techniques as an effective way to prevent discriminator overfitting. It is still unclear, however, that which augmentations could actually improve GANs, and in particular, how to apply a wider range of augmentations in training. In this paper, we propose a novel way to address these questions by incorporating a recent contrastive representation learning scheme into the GAN discriminator, coined ContraD. This \"fusion\" enables the discriminators to work with much stronger augmentations without increasing their training instability, thereby preventing the discriminator overfitting issue in GANs more effectively. Even better, we observe that the contrastive learning itself also benefits from our GAN training, i.e., by maintaining discriminative features between real and fake samples, suggesting a strong coherence between the two worlds: good contrastive representations are also good for GAN discriminators, and vice versa. Our experimental results show that GANs with ContraD consistently improve FID and IS compared to other recent techniques incorporating data augmentations, still maintaining highly discriminative features in the discriminator in terms of the linear evaluation. Finally, as a byproduct, we also show that our GANs trained in an unsupervised manner (without labels) can induce many conditional generative models via a simple latent sampling, leveraging the learned features of ContraD.

      "A standard pipeline of current face recognition frameworks consists of four individual steps: locating a face with a rough bounding box and several fiducial landmarks, aligning the face image using a pre-defined template, extracting representations and comparing. Among them, face detection, landmark detection and representation learning have long been studied and a lot of works have been proposed. As an essential step with a significant impact on recognition performance, the alignment step has attracted little attention. In this paper, we first explore and highlight the effects of different alignment templates on face recognition. Then, for the first time, we try to search for the optimal template automatically. We construct a well-defined searching space by decomposing the template searching into the crop size and vertical shift, and propose an efficient method Face Alignment Policy Search (FAPS). Besides, a well-designed benchmark is proposed to evaluate the searched policy. Experiments on our proposed benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method to improve face recognition performance.\n",
      "Deeply-learned planning methods are often based on learning representations that are optimized for unrelated tasks. For example, they might be trained on reconstructing the environment. These representations are then combined with predictor functions for simulating rollouts to navigate the environment. We find this principle of learning representations unsatisfying and propose to learn them such that they are directly optimized for the task at hand: to be maximally predictable for the predictor function. This results in representations that are by design optimal for the downstream task of planning, where the learned predictor function is used as a forward model.   To this end, we propose a new way of jointly learning this representation along with the prediction function, a system we dub Latent Representation Prediction Network (LARP). The prediction function is used as a forward model for search on a graph in a viewpoint-matching task and the representation learned to maximize predictability is found to outperform a pre-trained representation. Our approach is shown to be more sample-efficient than standard reinforcement learning methods and our learned representation transfers successfully to dissimilar objects.\n"

      "This paper presents SPICE, a Semantic Pseudo-labeling framework for Image ClustEring. Instead of using indirect loss functions required by the recently proposed methods, SPICE generates pseudo-labels via self-learning and directly uses the pseudo-label-based classification loss to train a deep clustering network. The basic idea of SPICE is to synergize the discrepancy among semantic clusters, the similarity among instance samples, and the semantic consistency of local samples in an embedding space to optimize the clustering network in a semantically-driven paradigm. Specifically, a semantic-similarity-based pseudo-labeling algorithm is first proposed to train a clustering network through unsupervised representation learning. Given the initial clustering results, a local semantic consistency principle is used to select a set of reliably labeled samples, and a semi-pseudo-labeling algorithm is adapted for performance boosting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPICE clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on six common benchmark datasets including STL10, Cifar10, Cifar100-20, ImageNet-10, ImageNet-Dog, and Tiny-ImageNet.

      "Developing an agent in reinforcement learning (RL) that is capable of performing complex control tasks directly from high-dimensional observation such as raw pixels is yet a challenge as efforts are made towards improving sample efficiency and generalization. This paper considers a learning framework for Curiosity Contrastive Forward Dynamics Model (CCFDM) in achieving a more sample-efficient RL based directly on raw pixels. CCFDM incorporates a forward dynamics model (FDM) and performs contrastive learning to train its deep convolutional neural network-based image encoder (IE) to extract conducive spatial and temporal information for achieving a more sample efficiency for RL. In addition, during training, CCFDM provides intrinsic rewards, produced based on FDM prediction error, encourages the curiosity of the RL agent to improve exploration. The diverge and less-repetitive observations provide by both our exploration strategy and data augmentation available in contrastive learning improve not only the sample efficiency but also the generalization.

      "Deep learning methods have made significant progress in ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The pretraining technique is usually adopted to support deep neural networks-based SAR ship detectors due to the scarce labeled SAR images. However, directly leveraging ImageNet pretraining is hardly to obtain a good ship detector because of different imaging perspective and geometry. In this paper, to resolve the problem of inconsistent imaging perspective between ImageNet and earth observations, we propose an optical ship detector (OSD) pretraining technique, which transfers the characteristics of ships in earth observations to SAR images from a large-scale aerial image dataset. On the other hand, to handle the problem of different imaging geometry between optical and SAR images, we propose an optical-SAR matching (OSM) pretraining technique, which transfers plentiful texture features from optical images to SAR images by common representation learning on the optical-SAR matching task. Finally, observing that the OSD pretraining based SAR ship detector has a better recall on sea area while the OSM pretraining based SAR ship detector can reduce false alarms on land area, we combine the predictions of the two detectors through weighted boxes fusion to further improve detection results. Extensive experiments on four SAR ship detection datasets and two representative CNN-based detection benchmarks are conducted to show the effectiveness and complementarity of the two proposed detectors, and the state-of-the-art performance of the combination of the two detectors. The proposed method won the sixth place of ship detection in SAR images in 2020 Gaofen challenge.\n",
      "Learning meaningful representations that disentangle the underlying structure of the data generating process is considered to be of key importance in machine learning. While disentangled representations were found to be useful for diverse tasks such as abstract reasoning and fair classification, their scalability and real-world impact remain questionable. We introduce a new high-resolution dataset with 1M simulated images and over 1,800 annotated real-world images of the same setup. In contrast to previous work, this new dataset exhibits correlations, a complex underlying structure, and allows to evaluate transfer to unseen simulated and real-world settings where the encoder i) remains in distribution or ii) is out of distribution. We propose new architectures in order to scale disentangled representation learning to realistic high-resolution settings and conduct a large-scale empirical study of disentangled representations on this dataset. We observe that disentanglement is a good predictor for out-of-distribution (OOD) task performance.\n",

Diagram is a special form of visual expression that frequently appears in the education field and is of great significance for learners to understand multimodal knowledge. Current research on diagrams preliminarily focuses on natural disciplines such as Biology and Geography, whose expressions are still similar to natural images. Another type of diagrams such as from Computer Science is composed of graphics containing complex topologies and relations, and research on this type of diagrams is still blank. The main challenges of graphic diagrams understanding are the rarity of data and the confusion of semantics, which are mainly reflected in the diversity of expressions. In this paper, we construct a novel dataset of graphic diagrams named Computer Science Diagrams (CSDia). It contains more than 1,200 diagrams and exhaustive annotations of objects and relations. Considering the visual noises caused by the various expressions in diagrams, we introduce the topology of diagrams to parse topological structure. After that, we propose Diagram Parsing Net (DPN) to represent the diagram from three branches: topology, visual feature, and text, and apply the model to the diagram classification task to evaluate the ability of diagrams understanding.

      "We propose PermaKey, a novel approach to representation learning based on object keypoints. It leverages the predictability of local image regions from spatial neighborhoods to identify salient regions that correspond to object parts, which are then converted to keypoints. Unlike prior approaches, it utilizes predictability to discover object keypoints, an intrinsic property of objects. This ensures that it does not overly bias keypoints to focus on characteristics that are not unique to objects, such as movement, shape, colour etc. We demonstrate the efficacy of PermaKey on Atari where it learns keypoints corresponding to the most salient object parts and is robust to certain visual distractors. Further, on downstream RL tasks in the Atari domain we demonstrate how agents equipped with our keypoints outperform those using competing alternatives, even on challenging environments with moving backgrounds or distractor objects.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various real-world applications due to their strong ability in graph representation learning. GNNs explore the graph structure and node features by aggregating and transforming information within node neighborhoods. However, through theoretical and empirical analysis, we reveal that the aggregation process of GNNs tends to destroy node similarity in the original feature space. There are many scenarios where node similarity plays a crucial role. Thus, it has motivated the proposed framework SimP-GCN that can effectively and efficiently preserve node similarity while exploiting graph structure. Specifically, to balance information from graph structure and node features, we propose a feature similarity preserving aggregation which adaptively integrates graph structure and node features. Furthermore, we employ self-supervised learning to explicitly capture the complex feature similarity and dissimilarity relations between nodes. We validate the effectiveness of SimP-GCN on seven benchmark datasets including three assortative and four disassorative graphs. The results demonstrate that SimP-GCN outperforms representative baselines. Further probe shows various advantages of the proposed framework.

This paper proposes a federated learning (FL) based dynamic map fusion framework to achieve high map quality despite unknown numbers of objects in fields of view (FoVs), various sensing and model uncertainties, and missing data labels for online learning. The novelty of this work is threefold: (1) developing a three-stage fusion scheme to predict the number of objects effectively and to fuse multiple local maps with fidelity scores; (2) developing an FL algorithm which fine-tunes feature models (i.e., representation learning networks for feature extraction) distributively by aggregating model parameters; (3) developing a knowledge distillation method to generate FL training labels when data labels are unavailable. The proposed framework is implemented in the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulation platform. Extensive experimental results are provided to verify the superior performance and robustness of the developed map fusion and FL schemes.\n",

However, state-of-the-art deep learning studies either focus on task-agnostic statistical dependency learning or do not model explicit feature dependencies during prediction. We propose a deep neural network framework, dGAP, to learn neural dependency Graph and optimize structure-Aware target Prediction simultaneously. dGAP trains towards a structure self-supervision loss and a target prediction loss jointly. Our method leads to an interpretable model that can disentangle sparse feature relationships, informing the user how relevant dependencies impact the target task. We empirically evaluate dGAP on multiple simulated and real datasets. dGAP is not only more accurate, but can also recover correct dependency structure.\n",
      "Sequential matching using hand-crafted heuristics has been standard practice in route-based place recognition for enhancing pairwise similarity results for nearly a decade. However, precision-recall performance of these algorithms dramatically degrades when searching on short temporal window (TW) lengths, while demanding high compute and storage costs on large robotic datasets for autonomous navigation research. Here, influenced by biological systems that robustly navigate spacetime scales even without vision, we develop a joint visual and positional representation learning technique, via a sequential process, and design a learning-based CNN+LSTM architecture, trainable via backpropagation through time, for viewpoint- and appearance-invariant place recognition. Our approach, Sequential Place Learning (SPL), is based on a CNN function that visually encodes an environment from a single traversal, thus reducing storage capacity, while an LSTM temporally fuses each visual embedding with corresponding positional data -- obtained from any source of motion estimation -- for direct sequential inference. Contrary to classical two-stage pipelines, e.g., match-then-temporally-filter, our network directly eliminates false-positive rates while jointly learning sequence matching from a single monocular image sequence, even using short TWs. Hence, we demonstrate that our model outperforms 15 classical methods while setting new state-of-the-art performance standards on 4 challenging benchmark datasets, where one of them can be considered solved with recall rates of 100% at 100% precision, correctly matching all places under extreme sunlight-darkness changes. In addition, we show that SPL can be up to 70x faster to deploy than classical methods on a 729 km route comprising 35,768 consecutive frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate the...

      "A growing body of research suggests that embodied gameplay, prevalent not just in human cultures but across a variety of animal species including turtles and ravens, is critical in developing the neural flexibility for creative problem solving, decision making, and socialization. Comparatively little is known regarding the impact of embodied gameplay upon artificial agents. While recent work has produced agents proficient in abstract games, these environments are far removed from the real world and thus these agents can provide little insight into the advantages of embodied play. Hiding games, such as hide-and-seek, played universally, provide a rich ground for studying the impact of embodied gameplay on representation learning in the context of perspective taking, secret keeping, and false belief understanding. Here we are the first to show that embodied adversarial reinforcement learning agents playing Cache, a variant of hide-and-seek, in a high fidelity, interactive, environment, learn generalizable representations of their observations encoding information such as object permanence, free space, and containment. Moving closer to biologically motivated learning strategies, our agents' representations, enhanced by intentionality and memory, are developed through interaction and play. These results serve as a model for studying how facets of vision develop through interaction, provide an experimental framework for assessing what is learned by artificial agents, and demonstrates the value of moving from large, static, datasets towards experiential, interactive, representation learning.\n",
      "Representation learning approaches require a massive amount of discriminative training data, which is unavailable in many scenarios, such as healthcare, smart city, education, etc. In practice, people refer to crowdsourcing to get annotated labels. However, due to issues like data privacy, budget limitation, shortage of domain-specific annotators, the number of crowdsourced labels is still very limited. Moreover, because of annotators' diverse expertises, crowdsourced labels are often inconsistent. Thus, directly applying existing supervised representation learning (SRL) algorithms may easily get the overfitting problem and yield suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \\emph{NeuCrowd}, a unified framework for SRL from crowdsourced labels. The proposed framework (1) creates a sufficient number of high-quality \\emph{n}-tuplet training samples by utilizing safety-aware sampling and robust anchor generation; and (2) automatically learns a neural sampling network that adaptively learns to select effective samples for SRL networks. The proposed framework is evaluated on both one synthetic and three real-world data sets. The results show that our approach outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and AUC. To encourage the reproducible results, we make our code publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/crowd-data-mining/NeuCrowd}.\n",
      "Tissue microarray (TMA) images have emerged as an important high-throughput tool for cancer study and the validation of biomarkers. Efforts have been dedicated to further improve the accuracy of TACOMA, a cutting-edge automatic scoring algorithm for TMA images. One major advance is due to deepTacoma, an algorithm that incorporates suitable deep representations of a group nature. Inspired by the recent advance in semi-supervised learning and deep learning, we propose mfTacoma to learn alternative deep representations in the context of TMA image scoring. In particular, mfTacoma learns the low-dimensional manifolds, a common latent structure in high dimensional data. Deep representation learning and manifold learning typically requires large data. By encoding deep representation of the manifolds as regularizing features, mfTacoma effectively leverages the manifold information that is potentially crude due to small data. Our experiments show that deep features by manifolds outperforms two alternatives -- deep features by linear manifolds with principal component analysis or by leveraging the group property.\n",
      "The two fields of machine learning and graphical causality arose and developed separately. However, there is now cross-pollination and increasing interest in both fields to benefit from the advances of the other. In the present paper, we review fundamental concepts of causal inference and relate them to crucial open problems of machine learning, including transfer and generalization, thereby assaying how causality can contribute to modern machine learning research. This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.\n",
      "To deal with various datasets over different complexity, this paper presents an self-adaptive learning model that combines the proposed Dynamic Connected Neural Decision Networks (DNDN) and a new pruning method--Dynamic Soft Pruning (DSP). DNDN is a combination of random forests and deep neural networks that enjoys both the advantages of strong classification capability of tree-like structure and representation learning capability of network structure. Based on Deep Neural Decision Forests (DNDF), this paper adopts an end-to-end training approach by representing the classification distribution with multiple randomly initialized softmax layers, which further allows an ensemble of multiple random forests attached to layers of neural network with different depth. We also propose a soft pruning method DSP to reduce the redundant connections of the network adaptively to avoid over-fitting simple dataset. The model demonstrates no performance loss compared with unpruned models and even higher robustness over different data and feature distribution. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over other popular algorithms in solving classification tasks.\n",
      "Knowledge Graphs (KG) are gaining increasing attention in both academia and industry. Despite their diverse benefits, recent research have identified social and cultural biases embedded in the representations learned from KGs. Such biases can have detrimental consequences on different population and minority groups as applications of KG begin to intersect and interact with social spheres. This paper aims at identifying and mitigating such biases in Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings. As a first step, we explore popularity bias -- the relationship between node popularity and link prediction accuracy. In case of node2vec graph embeddings, we find that prediction accuracy of the embedding is negatively correlated with the degree of the node. However, in case of knowledge-graph embeddings (KGE), we observe an opposite trend. As a second step, we explore gender bias in KGE, and a careful examination of popular KGE algorithms suggest that sensitive attribute like the gender of a person can be predicted from the embedding. This implies that such biases in popular KGs is captured by the structural properties of the embedding. As a preliminary solution to debiasing KGs, we introduce a novel framework to filter out the sensitive attribute information from the KG embeddings, which we call FAN (Filtering Adversarial Network). We also suggest the applicability of FAN for debiasing other network embeddings which could be explored in future work.\n",
      "Recent works have demonstrated reasonable success of representation learning in hypercomplex space. Specifically, \"fully-connected layers with Quaternions\" (4D hypercomplex numbers), which replace real-valued matrix multiplications in fully-connected layers with Hamilton products of Quaternions, both enjoy parameter savings with only 1/4 learnable parameters and achieve comparable performance in various applications. However, one key caveat is that hypercomplex space only exists at very few predefined dimensions (4D, 8D, and 16D). This restricts the flexibility of models that leverage hypercomplex multiplications. To this end, we propose parameterizing hypercomplex multiplications, allowing models to learn multiplication rules from data regardless of whether such rules are predefined. As a result, our method not only subsumes the Hamilton product, but also learns to operate on any arbitrary nD hypercomplex space, providing more architectural flexibility using arbitrarily $1/n$ learnable parameters compared with the fully-connected layer counterpart. Experiments of applications to the LSTM and Transformer models on natural language inference, machine translation, text style transfer, and subject verb agreement demonstrate architectural flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n",
      "COVID-19 classification using chest Computed Tomography (CT) has been found pragmatically useful by several studies. Due to the lack of annotated samples, these studies recommend transfer learning and explore the choices of pre-trained models and data augmentation. However, it is still unknown if there are better strategies than vanilla transfer learning for more accurate COVID-19 classification with limited CT data. This paper provides an affirmative answer, devising a novel `model' augmentation technique that allows a considerable performance boost to transfer learning for the task. Our method systematically reduces the distributional shift between the source and target domains and considers augmenting deep learning with complementary representation learning techniques. We establish the efficacy of our method with publicly available datasets and models, along with identifying contrasting observations in the previous studies.\n",
      "We implement stacked denoising autoencoders, a class of neural networks that are capable of learning powerful representations of high dimensional data. We describe stochastic gradient descent for unsupervised training of autoencoders, as well as a novel genetic algorithm based approach that makes use of gradient information. We analyze the performance of both optimization algorithms and also the representation learning ability of the autoencoder when it is trained on standard image classification datasets.\n",
      "The success of deep learning in the computer vision and natural language processing communities can be attributed to training of very deep neural networks with millions or billions of parameters which can then be trained with massive amounts of data. However, similar trend has largely eluded training of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms where larger networks do not lead to performance improvement. Previous work has shown that this is mostly due to instability during training of deep RL agents when using larger networks. In this paper, we make an attempt to understand and address training of larger networks for deep RL. We first show that naively increasing network capacity does not improve performance. Then, we propose a novel method that consists of 1) wider networks with DenseNet connection, 2) decoupling representation learning from training of RL, 3) a distributed training method to mitigate overfitting problems. Using this three-fold technique, we show that we can train very large networks that result in significant performance gains. We present several ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and some intuitive understanding of the reasons for performance gain. We show that our proposed method outperforms other baseline algorithms on several challenging locomotion tasks.\n",
      "In this paper, we consider the framework of multi-task representation (MTR) learning where the goal is to use source tasks to learn a representation that reduces the sample complexity of solving a target task. We start by reviewing recent advances in MTR theory and show that they can provide novel insights for popular meta-learning algorithms when analyzed within this framework. In particular, we highlight a fundamental difference between gradient-based and metric-based algorithms and put forward a theoretical analysis to explain it. Finally, we use the derived insights to improve the generalization capacity of meta-learning methods via a new spectral-based regularization term and confirm its efficiency through experimental studies on classic few-shot classification and continual learning benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first contribution that puts the most recent learning bounds of MTR theory into practice of training popular meta-learning methods.\n",
      "Clustering performs an essential role in many real world applications, such as market research, pattern recognition, data analysis, and image processing. However, due to the high dimensionality of the input feature values, the data being fed to clustering algorithms usually contains noise and thus could lead to in-accurate clustering results. While traditional dimension reduction and feature selection algorithms could be used to address this problem, the simple heuristic rules used in those algorithms are based on some particular assumptions. When those assumptions does not hold, these algorithms then might not work. In this paper, we propose DAC, Deep Autoencoder-based Clustering, a generalized data-driven framework to learn clustering representations using deep neuron networks. Experiment results show that our approach could effectively boost performance of the K-Means clustering algorithm on a variety types of datasets.\n",
      "This paper describes an end-to-end solution for the relationship prediction task in heterogeneous, multi-relational graphs. We particularly address two building blocks in the pipeline, namely heterogeneous graph representation learning and negative sampling. Existing message passing-based graph neural networks use edges either for graph traversal and/or selection of message encoding functions. Ignoring the edge semantics could have severe repercussions on the quality of embeddings, especially when dealing with two nodes having multiple relations. Furthermore, the expressivity of the learned representation depends on the quality of negative samples used during training. Although existing hard negative sampling techniques can identify challenging negative relationships for optimization, new techniques are required to control false negatives during training as false negatives could corrupt the learning process. To address these issues, first, we propose RelGNN -- a message passing-based heterogeneous graph attention model. In particular, RelGNN generates the states of different relations and leverages them along with the node states to weigh the messages. RelGNN also adopts a self-attention mechanism to balance the importance of attribute features and topological features for generating the final entity embeddings. Second, we introduce a parameter-free negative sampling technique -- adaptive self-adversarial (ASA) negative sampling. ASA reduces the false-negative rate by leveraging positive relationships to effectively guide the identification of true negative samples. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that RelGNN optimized by ASA for relationship prediction improves state-of-the-art performance across established benchmarks as well as on a real industrial dataset.\n",
      "We propose a Healthcare Graph Convolutional Network (HealGCN) to offer disease self-diagnosis service for online users based on Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs). Two main challenges are focused in this paper for online disease diagnosis: (1) serving cold-start users via graph convolutional networks and (2) handling scarce clinical description via a symptom retrieval system. To this end, we first organize the EHR data into a heterogeneous graph that is capable of modeling complex interactions among users, symptoms and diseases, and tailor the graph representation learning towards disease diagnosis with an inductive learning paradigm. Then, we build a disease self-diagnosis system with a corresponding EHR Graph-based Symptom Retrieval System (GraphRet) that can search and provide a list of relevant alternative symptoms by tracing the predefined meta-paths. GraphRet helps enrich the seed symptom set through the EHR graph when confronting users with scarce descriptions, hence yield better diagnosis accuracy. At last, we validate the superiority of our model on a large-scale EHR dataset.\n",
      "Data augmentation is often used to enlarge datasets with synthetic samples generated in accordance with the underlying data distribution. To enable a wider range of augmentations, we explore negative data augmentation strategies (NDA)that intentionally create out-of-distribution samples. We show that such negative out-of-distribution samples provide information on the support of the data distribution, and can be leveraged for generative modeling and representation learning. We introduce a new GAN training objective where we use NDA as an additional source of synthetic data for the discriminator. We prove that under suitable conditions, optimizing the resulting objective still recovers the true data distribution but can directly bias the generator towards avoiding samples that lack the desired structure. Empirically, models trained with our method achieve improved conditional/unconditional image generation along with improved anomaly detection capabilities. Further, we incorporate the same negative data augmentation strategy in a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised representation learning on images and videos, achieving improved performance on downstream image classification, object detection, and action recognition tasks. These results suggest that prior knowledge on what does not constitute valid data is an effective form of weak supervision across a range of unsupervised learning tasks.\n",
      "This paper presents a simple unsupervised visual representation learning method with a pretext task of discriminating all images in a dataset using a parametric, instance-level classifier. The overall framework is a replica of a supervised classification model, where semantic classes (e.g., dog, bird, and ship) are replaced by instance IDs. However, scaling up the classification task from thousands of semantic labels to millions of instance labels brings specific challenges including 1) the large-scale softmax computation; 2) the slow convergence due to the infrequent visiting of instance samples; and 3) the massive number of negative classes that can be noisy. This work presents several novel techniques to handle these difficulties. First, we introduce a hybrid parallel training framework to make large-scale training feasible. Second, we present a raw-feature initialization mechanism for classification weights, which we assume offers a contrastive prior for instance discrimination and can clearly speed up converge in our experiments. Finally, we propose to smooth the labels of a few hardest classes to avoid optimizing over very similar negative pairs. While being conceptually simple, our framework achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, i.e., SimCLR, MoCoV2, and PIC under ImageNet linear evaluation protocol and on several downstream visual tasks, verifying that full instance classification is a strong pretraining technique for many semantic visual tasks.\n",
      "Representation learning for graphs enables the application of standard machine learning algorithms and data analysis tools to graph data. Replacing discrete unordered objects such as graph nodes by real-valued vectors is at the heart of many approaches to learning from graph data. Such vector representations, or embeddings, capture the discrete relationships in the original data by representing nodes as vectors in a high-dimensional space.   In most applications graphs model the relationship between real-life objects and often nodes contain valuable meta-information about the original objects. While being a powerful machine learning tool, embeddings are not able to preserve such node attributes. We address this shortcoming and consider the problem of learning discrete node embeddings such that the coordinates of the node vector representations are graph nodes. This opens the door to designing interpretable machine learning algorithms for graphs as all attributes originally present in the nodes are preserved.   We present a framework for coordinated local graph neighborhood sampling (COLOGNE) such that each node is represented by a fixed number of graph nodes, together with their attributes. Individual samples are coordinated and they preserve the similarity between node neighborhoods. We consider different notions of similarity for which we design scalable algorithms. We show theoretical results for all proposed algorithms. Experiments on benchmark graphs evaluate the quality of the designed embeddings and demonstrate how the proposed embeddings can be used in training interpretable machine learning algorithms for graph data.\n",
      "Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new environments. Representation learning -- a key tool for performing meta-learning -- learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce. Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression -- in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity of learning these linear features.\n",
      "The medical field is creating large amount of data that physicians are unable to decipher and use efficiently. Moreover, rule-based expert systems are inefficient in solving complicated medical tasks or for creating insights using big data. Deep learning has emerged as a more accurate and effective technology in a wide range of medical problems such as diagnosis, prediction and intervention. Deep learning is a representation learning method that consists of layers that transform the data non-linearly, thus, revealing hierarchical relationships and structures. In this review we survey deep learning application papers that use structured data, signal and imaging modalities from cardiology. We discuss the advantages and limitations of applying deep learning in cardiology that also apply in medicine in general, while proposing certain directions as the most viable for clinical use.\n",
      "For machine learning models to be most useful in numerous sociotechnical systems, many have argued that they must be human-interpretable. However, despite increasing interest in interpretability, there remains no firm consensus on how to measure it. This is especially true in representation learning, where interpretability research has focused on \"disentanglement\" measures only applicable to synthetic datasets and not grounded in human factors. We introduce a task to quantify the human-interpretability of generative model representations, where users interactively modify representations to reconstruct target instances. On synthetic datasets, we find performance on this task much more reliably differentiates entangled and disentangled models than baseline approaches. On a real dataset, we find it differentiates between representation learning methods widely believed but never shown to produce more or less interpretable models. In both cases, we ran small-scale think-aloud studies and large-scale experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk to confirm that our qualitative and quantitative results agreed.\n",
      "Continual learning aims to provide intelligent agents capable of learning multiple tasks sequentially with neural networks. One of its main challenging, catastrophic forgetting, is caused by the neural networks non-optimal ability to learn in non-stationary distributions. In most settings of the current approaches, the agent starts from randomly initialized parameters and is optimized to master the current task regardless of the usefulness of the learned representation for future tasks. Moreover, each of the future tasks uses all the previously learned knowledge although parts of this knowledge might not be helpful for its learning. These cause interference among tasks, especially when the data of previous tasks is not accessible. In this paper, we propose a new method, named Self-Attention Meta-Learner (SAM), which learns a prior knowledge for continual learning that permits learning a sequence of tasks, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. SAM incorporates an attention mechanism that learns to select the particular relevant representation for each future task. Each task builds a specific representation branch on top of the selected knowledge, avoiding the interference between tasks. We evaluate the proposed method on the Split CIFAR-10/100 and Split MNIST benchmarks in the task agnostic inference. We empirically show that we can achieve a better performance than several state-of-the-art methods for continual learning by building on the top of selected representation learned by SAM. We also show the role of the meta-attention mechanism in boosting informative features corresponding to the input data and identifying the correct target in the task agnostic inference. Finally, we demonstrate that popular existing continual learning methods gain a performance boost when they adopt SAM as a starting point.\n",
      "Electronic health record (EHR) data is sparse and irregular as it is recorded at irregular time intervals, and different clinical variables are measured at each observation point. In this work, we propose a multi-view features integration learning from irregular multivariate time series data by self-attention mechanism in an imputation-free manner. Specifically, we devise a novel multi-integration attention module (MIAM) to extract complex information inherent in irregular time series data. In particular, we explicitly learn the relationships among the observed values, missing indicators, and time interval between the consecutive observations, simultaneously. The rationale behind our approach is the use of human knowledge such as what to measure and when to measure in different situations, which are indirectly represented in the data. In addition, we build an attention-based decoder as a missing value imputer that helps empower the representation learning of the inter-relations among multi-view observations for the prediction task, which operates at the training phase only. We validated the effectiveness of our method over the public MIMIC-III and PhysioNet challenge 2012 datasets by comparing with and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for in-hospital mortality prediction.\n",

      "This thesis is a proof of concept for the potential of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) on representation learning of real-world Knowledge Graphs (KG). Inspired by successful approaches to the generation of molecular graphs, we evaluate the capabilities of our model, the Relational Graph Variational Auto-Encoder (RGVAE). The impact of the modular hyperparameter choices, encoding through graph convolutions, graph matching and latent space prior, is compared. The RGVAE is first evaluated on link prediction. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores on the two datasets FB15K-237 and WN18RR are compared to the embedding-based model DistMult. A variational DistMult and a RGVAE without latent space prior constraint are implemented as control models. The results show that between different settings, the RGVAE with relaxed latent space, scores highest on both datasets, yet does not outperform the DistMult. Further, we investigate the latent space in a twofold experiment: first, linear interpolation between the latent representation of two triples, then the exploration of each latent dimension in a $95\\%$ confidence interval. Both interpolations show that the RGVAE learns to reconstruct the adjacency matrix but fails to disentangle. For the last experiment we introduce a new validation method for the FB15K-237 data set. The relation type-constrains of generated triples are filtered and matched with entity types. The observed rate of valid generated triples is insignificantly higher than the random threshold. All generated and valid triples are unseen. A comparison between different latent space priors, using the $\\delta$-VAE method, reveals a decoder collapse. Finally we analyze the limiting factors of our approach compared to molecule generation and propose solutions for the decoder collapse and successful representation learning of multi-relational KGs.\n",
      "This paper proposes a Disentangled gEnerative cAusal Representation (DEAR) learning method. Unlike existing disentanglement methods that enforce independence of the latent variables, we consider the general case where the underlying factors of interests can be causally correlated. We show that previous methods with independent priors fail to disentangle causally correlated factors. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new disentangled learning method called DEAR that enables causal controllable generation and causal representation learning. The key ingredient of this new formulation is to use a structural causal model (SCM) as the prior for a bidirectional generative model. The prior is then trained jointly with a generator and an encoder using a suitable GAN loss incorporated with supervision. We provide theoretical justification on the identifiability and asymptotic consistency of the proposed method, which guarantees disentangled causal representation learning under appropriate conditions. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthesized and real data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of DEAR in causal controllable generation, and the benefits of the learned representations for downstream tasks in terms of sample efficiency and distributional robustness.\n",
      "Learning disentangled representations leads to interpretable models and facilitates data generation with style transfer, which has been extensively studied on static data such as images in an unsupervised learning framework. However, only a few works have explored unsupervised disentangled sequential representation learning due to challenges of generating sequential data. In this paper, we propose recurrent Wasserstein Autoencoder (R-WAE), a new framework for generative modeling of sequential data. R-WAE disentangles the representation of an input sequence into static and dynamic factors (i.e., time-invariant and time-varying parts). Our theoretical analysis shows that, R-WAE minimizes an upper bound of a penalized form of the Wasserstein distance between model distribution and sequential data distribution, and simultaneously maximizes the mutual information between input data and different disentangled latent factors, respectively. This is superior to (recurrent) VAE which does not explicitly enforce mutual information maximization between input data and disentangled latent representations. When the number of actions in sequential data is available as weak supervision information, R-WAE is extended to learn a categorical latent representation of actions to improve its disentanglement. Experiments on a variety of datasets show that our models outperform other baselines with the same settings in terms of disentanglement and unconditional video generation both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n",
      "Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable autonomous agents, such as robots, to quickly acquire new behaviors by leveraging prior experience in a set of related training tasks. However, the onerous data requirements of meta-training compounded with the challenge of learning from sensory inputs such as images have made meta-RL challenging to apply to real robotic systems. Latent state models, which learn compact state representations from a sequence of observations, can accelerate representation learning from visual inputs. In this paper, we leverage the perspective of meta-learning as task inference to show that latent state models can \\emph{also} perform meta-learning given an appropriately defined observation space. Building on this insight, we develop meta-RL with latent dynamics (MELD), an algorithm for meta-RL from images that performs inference in a latent state model to quickly acquire new skills given observations and rewards. MELD outperforms prior meta-RL methods on several simulated image-based robotic control problems, and enables a real WidowX robotic arm to insert an Ethernet cable into new locations given a sparse task completion signal after only $8$ hours of real world meta-training. To our knowledge, MELD is the first meta-RL algorithm trained in a real-world robotic control setting from images.\n",
      "Reinforcement Learning has been able to solve many complicated robotics tasks without any need for feature engineering in an end-to-end fashion. However, learning the optimal policy directly from the sensory inputs, i.e the observations, often requires processing and storage of a huge amount of data. In the context of robotics, the cost of data from real robotics hardware is usually very high, thus solutions that achieve high sample-efficiency are needed. We propose a method that aims at learning a mapping from the observations into a lower-dimensional state space. This mapping is learned with unsupervised learning using loss functions shaped to incorporate prior knowledge of the environment and the task. Using the samples from the state space, the optimal policy is quickly and efficiently learned. We test the method on several mobile robot navigation tasks in a simulation environment and also on a real robot.\n",
      "We present deep significance clustering (DICE), a framework for jointly performing representation learning and clustering for \"outcome-aware\" stratification. DICE is intended to generate cluster membership that may be used to categorize a population by individual risk level for a targeted outcome. Following the representation learning and clustering steps, we embed the objective function in DICE with a constraint which requires a statistically significant association between the outcome and cluster membership of learned representations. DICE further includes a neural architecture search step to maximize both the likelihood of representation learning and outcome classification accuracy with cluster membership as the predictor. To demonstrate its utility in medicine for patient risk-stratification, the performance of DICE was evaluated using two datasets with different outcome ratios extracted from real-world electronic health records. Outcomes are defined as acute kidney injury (30.4\\%) among a cohort of COVID-19 patients, and discharge disposition (36.8\\%) among a cohort of heart failure patients, respectively. Extensive results demonstrate that DICE has superior performance as measured by the difference in outcome distribution across clusters, Silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index for clustering, and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for outcome classification compared to several baseline approaches.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in representation learning on graphs and achieved superior performance in tasks such as node classification. However, analyzing heterogeneous graph of different types of nodes and links still brings great challenges for injecting the heterogeneity into a graph neural network. A general remedy is to manually or automatically design meta-paths to transform a heterogeneous graph into a homogeneous graph, but this is suboptimal since the features from the first-order neighbors are not fully leveraged for training and inference. In this paper, we propose simple and effective graph neural networks for heterogeneous graph, excluding the use of meta-paths. Specifically, our models focus on relaxing the heterogeneity stress for model parameters by expanding model capacity of general GNNs in an effective way. Extensive experimental results on six real-world graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed models over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate the potentially good balance between reducing the heterogeneity stress and increasing the parameter size. Our code is freely available for reproducing our results.\n",
      "In recent years, ride-hailing services have been increasingly prevalent as they provide huge convenience for passengers. As a fundamental problem, the timely prediction of passenger demands in different regions is vital for effective traffic flow control and route planning. As both spatial and temporal patterns are indispensable passenger demand prediction, relevant research has evolved from pure time series to graph-structured data for modeling historical passenger demand data, where a snapshot graph is constructed for each time slot by connecting region nodes via different relational edges (e.g., origin-destination relationship, geographical distance, etc.). Consequently, the spatiotemporal passenger demand records naturally carry dynamic patterns in the constructed graphs, where the edges also encode important information about the directions and volume (i.e., weights) of passenger demands between two connected regions. However, existing graph-based solutions fail to simultaneously consider those three crucial aspects of dynamic, directed, and weighted (DDW) graphs, leading to limited expressiveness when learning graph representations for passenger demand prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel spatiotemporal graph attention network, namely Gallat (Graph prediction with all attention) as a solution. In Gallat, by comprehensively incorporating those three intrinsic properties of DDW graphs, we build three attention layers to fully capture the spatiotemporal dependencies among different regions across all historical time slots. Moreover, the model employs a subtask to conduct pretraining so that it can obtain accurate results more quickly. We evaluate the proposed model on real-world datasets, and our experimental results demonstrate that Gallat outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.\n",
      "Self-supervised pre-training (SSP) employs random image transformations to generate training data for visual representation learning. In this paper, we first present a modeling framework that unifies existing SSP methods as learning to predict pseudo-labels. Then, we propose new data augmentation methods of generating training examples whose pseudo-labels are harder to predict than those generated via random image transformations. Specifically, we use adversarial training and CutMix to create hard examples (HEXA) to be used as augmented views for MoCo-v2 and DeepCluster-v2, leading to two variants HEXA_{MoCo} and HEXA_{DCluster}, respectively. In our experiments, we pre-train models on ImageNet and evaluate them on multiple public benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that the two new algorithm variants outperform their original counterparts, and achieve new state-of-the-art on a wide range of tasks where limited task supervision is available for fine-tuning. These results verify that hard examples are instrumental in improving the generalization of the pre-trained models.\n",
      "Deep generative models have achieved great success in areas such as image, speech, and natural language processing in the past few years. Thanks to the advances in graph-based deep learning, and in particular graph representation learning, deep graph generation methods have recently emerged with new applications ranging from discovering novel molecular structures to modeling social networks. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on deep learning-based graph generation approaches and classifies them into five broad categories, namely, autoregressive, autoencoder-based, RL-based, adversarial, and flow-based graph generators, providing the readers a detailed description of the methods in each class. We also present publicly available source codes, commonly used datasets, and the most widely utilized evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the existing challenges and discuss future research directions.\n",
      "Knowledge Graphs have been one of the fundamental methods for integrating heterogeneous data sources. Integrating heterogeneous data sources is crucial, especially in the biomedical domain, where central data-driven tasks such as drug discovery rely on incorporating information from different biomedical databases. These databases contain various biological entities and relations such as proteins (PDB), genes (Gene Ontology), drugs (DrugBank), diseases (DDB), and protein-protein interactions (BioGRID). The process of semantically integrating heterogeneous biomedical databases is often riddled with imperfections. The quality of data-driven drug discovery relies on the accuracy of the mining methods used and the data's quality as well. Thus, having complete and refined biomedical knowledge graphs is central to achieving more accurate drug discovery outcomes. Here we propose using the latest graph representation learning and embedding models to refine and complete biomedical knowledge graphs. This preliminary work demonstrates learning discrete representations of the integrated biomedical knowledge graph Chem2Bio2RD [3]. We perform a knowledge graph completion and refinement task using a simple top-K cosine similarity measure between the learned embedding vectors to predict missing links between drugs and targets present in the data. We show that this simple procedure can be used alternatively to binary classifiers in link prediction.\n",
      "Many unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) person re-identification (ReID) approaches combine clustering-based pseudo-label prediction with feature fine-tuning. However, because of domain gap, the pseudo-labels are not always reliable and there are noisy/incorrect labels. This would mislead the feature representation learning and deteriorate the performance. In this paper, we propose to estimate and exploit the credibility of the assigned pseudo-label of each sample to alleviate the influence of noisy labels, by suppressing the contribution of noisy samples. We build our baseline framework using the mean teacher method together with an additional contrastive loss. We have observed that a sample with a wrong pseudo-label through clustering in general has a weaker consistency between the output of the mean teacher model and the student model. Based on this finding, we propose to exploit the uncertainty (measured by consistency levels) to evaluate the reliability of the pseudo-label of a sample and incorporate the uncertainty to re-weight its contribution within various ReID losses, including the identity (ID) classification loss per sample, the triplet loss, and the contrastive loss. Our uncertainty-guided optimization brings significant improvement and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.\n",
      "Nowadays Knowledge Graphs constitute a mainstream approach for the representation of relational information on big heterogeneous data, however, they may contain a big amount of imputed noise when constructed automatically. To address this problem, different error detection methodologies have been proposed, mainly focusing on path ranking and representation learning. This work presents various mainstream approaches and proposes a hybrid and modular methodology for the task. We compare different methods on two benchmarks and one real-world biomedical publications dataset, showcasing the potential of our approach and providing insights on graph embeddings when dealing with noisy Knowledge Graphs.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a framework for graph representation learning, where a model learns to generate low dimensional node embeddings that encapsulate structural and feature-related information. GNNs are usually trained in an end-to-end fashion, leading to highly specialized node embeddings. However, generating node embeddings that can be used to perform multiple tasks (with performance comparable to single-task models) is an open problem. We propose a novel meta-learning strategy capable of producing multi-task node embeddings. Our method avoids the difficulties arising when learning to perform multiple tasks concurrently by, instead, learning to quickly (i.e. with a few steps of gradient descent) adapt to multiple tasks singularly. We show that the embeddings produced by our method can be used to perform multiple tasks with comparable or higher performance than classically trained models. Our method is model-agnostic and task-agnostic, thus applicable to a wide variety of multi-task domains.\n",
      "Events in the real world are correlated across nearby points in time, and we must learn from this temporally smooth data. However, when neural networks are trained to categorize or reconstruct single items, the common practice is to randomize the order of training items. What are the effects of temporally smooth training data on the efficiency of learning? We first tested the effects of smoothness in training data on incremental learning in feedforward nets and found that smoother data slowed learning. Moreover, sampling so as to minimize temporal smoothness produced more efficient learning than sampling randomly. If smoothness generally impairs incremental learning, then how can networks be modified to benefit from smoothness in the training data? We hypothesized that two simple brain-inspired mechanisms, leaky memory in activation units and memory-gating, could enable networks to rapidly extract useful representations from smooth data. Across all levels of data smoothness, these brain-inspired architectures achieved more efficient category learning than feedforward networks. This advantage persisted, even when leaky memory networks with gating were trained on smooth data and tested on randomly-ordered data. Finally, we investigated how these brain-inspired mechanisms altered the internal representations learned by the networks. We found that networks with multi-scale leaky memory and memory-gating could learn internal representations that un-mixed data sources which vary on fast and slow timescales across training samples. Altogether, we identified simple mechanisms enabling neural networks to learn more quickly from temporally smooth data, and to generate internal representations that separate timescales in the training signal.\n",
      "Recent years have witnessed the emergence and flourishing of hierarchical graph pooling neural networks (HGPNNs) which are effective graph representation learning approaches for graph level tasks such as graph classification. However, current HGPNNs do not take full advantage of the graph's intrinsic structures (e.g., community structure). Moreover, the pooling operations in existing HGPNNs are difficult to be interpreted. In this paper, we propose a new interpretable graph pooling framework - CommPOOL, that can capture and preserve the hierarchical community structure of graphs in the graph representation learning process. Specifically, the proposed community pooling mechanism in CommPOOL utilizes an unsupervised approach for capturing the inherent community structure of graphs in an interpretable manner. CommPOOL is a general and flexible framework for hierarchical graph representation learning that can further facilitate various graph-level tasks. Evaluations on five public benchmark datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the superior performance of CommPOOL in graph representation learning for graph classification compared to the state-of-the-art baseline methods, and its effectiveness in capturing and preserving the community structure of graphs.\n",
      "In this work we propose for the first time a transformer-based framework for unsupervised representation learning of multivariate time series. Pre-trained models can be potentially used for downstream tasks such as regression and classification, forecasting and missing value imputation. By evaluating our models on several benchmark datasets for multivariate time series regression and classification, we show that not only does our modeling approach represent the most successful method employing unsupervised learning of multivariate time series presented to date, but also that it exceeds the current state-of-the-art performance of supervised methods; it does so even when the number of training samples is very limited, while offering computational efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training of our transformer models offers a substantial performance benefit over fully supervised learning, even without leveraging additional unlabeled data, i.e., by reusing the same data samples through the unsupervised objective.\n",
      "Floorplans are commonly used to represent the layout of buildings. In computer aided-design (CAD) floorplans are usually represented in the form of hierarchical graph structures. Research works towards computational techniques that facilitate the design process, such as automated analysis and optimization, often use simple floorplan representations that ignore the semantics of the space and do not take into account usage related analytics. We present a floorplan embedding technique that uses an attributed graph to represent the geometric information as well as design semantics and behavioral features of the inhabitants as node and edge attributes. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture is proposed and trained to embed attributed graphs as vectors in a continuous space. A user study is conducted to evaluate the coupling of similar floorplans retrieved from the embedding space with respect to a given input (e.g., design layout). The qualitative, quantitative and user-study evaluations show that our embedding framework produces meaningful and accurate vector representations for floorplans. In addition, our proposed model is a generative model. We studied and showcased its effectiveness for generating new floorplans. We also release the dataset that we have constructed and which, for each floorplan, includes the design semantics attributes as well as simulation generated human behavioral features for further study in the community.\n",
      "The artistic style of a painting is a rich descriptor that reveals both visual and deep intrinsic knowledge about how an artist uniquely portrays and expresses their creative vision. Accurate categorization of paintings across different artistic movements and styles is critical for large-scale indexing of art databases. However, the automatic extraction and recognition of these highly dense artistic features has received little to no attention in the field of computer vision research. In this paper, we investigate the use of deep self-supervised learning methods to solve the problem of recognizing complex artistic styles with high intra-class and low inter-class variation. Further, we outperform existing approaches by almost 20% on a highly class imbalanced WikiArt dataset with 27 art categories. To achieve this, we train the EnAET semi-supervised learning model (Wang et al., 2019) with limited annotated data samples and supplement it with self-supervised representations learned from an ensemble of spatial and non-spatial transformations.\n",
      "Value Iteration Networks (VINs) have emerged as a popular method to incorporate planning algorithms within deep reinforcement learning, enabling performance improvements on tasks requiring long-range reasoning and understanding of environment dynamics. This came with several limitations, however: the model is not incentivised in any way to perform meaningful planning computations, the underlying state space is assumed to be discrete, and the Markov decision process (MDP) is assumed fixed and known. We propose eXecuted Latent Value Iteration Networks (XLVINs), which combine recent developments across contrastive self-supervised learning, graph representation learning and neural algorithmic reasoning to alleviate all of the above limitations, successfully deploying VIN-style models on generic environments. XLVINs match the performance of VIN-like models when the underlying MDP is discrete, fixed and known, and provides significant improvements to model-free baselines across three general MDP setups.\n",
      "Deep model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to substantially improve the sample-efficiency of deep RL. While various challenges have long held it back, a number of papers have recently come out reporting success with deep model-based methods. This is a great development, but the lack of a consistent metric to evaluate such methods makes it difficult to compare various approaches. For example, the common single-task sample-efficiency metric conflates improvements due to model-based learning with various other aspects, such as representation learning, making it difficult to assess true progress on model-based RL. To address this, we introduce an experimental setup to evaluate model-based behavior of RL methods, inspired by work from neuroscience on detecting model-based behavior in humans and animals. Our metric based on this setup, the Local Change Adaptation (LoCA) regret, measures how quickly an RL method adapts to a local change in the environment. Our metric can identify model-based behavior, even if the method uses a poor representation and provides insight in how close a method's behavior is from optimal model-based behavior. We use our setup to evaluate the model-based behavior of MuZero on a variation of the classic Mountain Car task.\n",
      "There has recently been increasing interest in learning representations of temporal knowledge graphs (KGs), which record the dynamic relationships between entities over time. Temporal KGs often exhibit multiple simultaneous non-Euclidean structures, such as hierarchical and cyclic structures. However, existing embedding approaches for temporal KGs typically learn entity representations and their dynamic evolution in the Euclidean space, which might not capture such intrinsic structures very well. To this end, we propose Dy- ERNIE, a non-Euclidean embedding approach that learns evolving entity representations in a product of Riemannian manifolds, where the composed spaces are estimated from the sectional curvatures of underlying data. Product manifolds enable our approach to better reflect a wide variety of geometric structures on temporal KGs. Besides, to capture the evolutionary dynamics of temporal KGs, we let the entity representations evolve according to a velocity vector defined in the tangent space at each timestamp. We analyze in detail the contribution of geometric spaces to representation learning of temporal KGs and evaluate our model on temporal knowledge graph completion tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate significantly improved performance, indicating that the dynamics of multi-relational graph data can be more properly modeled by the evolution of embeddings on Riemannian manifolds.\n",
      "Contrastive representation learning has been recently proved to be very efficient for self-supervised training. These methods have been successfully used to train encoders which perform comparably to supervised training on downstream classification tasks. A few works have started to build a theoretical framework around contrastive learning in which guarantees for its performance can be proven. We provide extensions of these results to training with multiple negative samples and for multiway classification. Furthermore, we provide convergence guarantees for the minimization of the contrastive training error with gradient descent of an overparametrized deep neural encoder, and provide some numerical experiments that complement our theoretical findings\n",
      "Self-supervised representation learning has seen remarkable progress in the last few years. More recently, contrastive instance learning has shown impressive results compared to its supervised learning counterparts. However, even with the ever increased interest in contrastive instance learning, it is still largely unclear why these methods work so well. In this paper, we aim to unravel some of the mysteries behind their success, which are the good practices. Through an extensive empirical analysis, we hope to not only provide insights but also lay out a set of best practices that led to the success of recent work in self-supervised representation learning.\n",
      "High dimensional data analysis for exploration and discovery includes three fundamental tasks: dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization. When the three associated tasks are done separately, as is often the case thus far, inconsistencies can occur among the tasks in terms of data geometry and others. This can lead to confusing or misleading data interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network-based method, called Consistent Representation Learning (CRL), to accomplish the three associated tasks end-to-end and improve the consistencies. The CRL network consists of two nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) transformations: (1) one from the input data space to the latent feature space for clustering, and (2) the other from the clustering space to the final 2D or 3D space for visualization. Importantly, the two NLDR transformations are performed to best satisfy local geometry preserving (LGP) constraints across the spaces or network layers, to improve data consistencies along with the processing flow. Also, we propose a novel metric, clustering-visualization inconsistency (CVI), for evaluating the inconsistencies. Extensive comparative results show that the proposed CRL neural network method outperforms the popular t-SNE and UMAP-based and other contemporary clustering and visualization algorithms in terms of evaluation metrics and visualization.\n",
      "Fair representation learning provides an effective way of enforcing fairness constraints without compromising utility for downstream users. A desirable family of such fairness constraints, each requiring similar treatment for similar individuals, is known as individual fairness. In this work, we introduce the first method that enables data consumers to obtain certificates of individual fairness for existing and new data points. The key idea is to map similar individuals to close latent representations and leverage this latent proximity to certify individual fairness. That is, our method enables the data producer to learn and certify a representation where for a data point all similar individuals are at $\\ell_\\infty$-distance at most $\\epsilon$, thus allowing data consumers to certify individual fairness by proving $\\epsilon$-robustness of their classifier. Our experimental evaluation on five real-world datasets and several fairness constraints demonstrates the expressivity and scalability of our approach.\n",
      "Canine mammary carcinoma (CMC) has been used as a model to investigate the pathogenesis of human breast cancer and the same grading scheme is commonly used to assess tumor malignancy in both. One key component of this grading scheme is the density of mitotic figures (MF). Current publicly available datasets on human breast cancer only provide annotations for small subsets of whole slide images (WSIs). We present a novel dataset of 21 WSIs of CMC completely annotated for MF. For this, a pathologist screened all WSIs for potential MF and structures with a similar appearance. A second expert blindly assigned labels, and for non-matching labels, a third expert assigned the final labels. Additionally, we used machine learning to identify previously undetected MF. Finally, we performed representation learning and two-dimensional projection to further increase the consistency of the annotations. Our dataset consists of 13,907 MF and 36,379 hard negatives. We achieved a mean F1-score of 0.791 on the test set and of up to 0.696 on a human breast cancer dataset.\n",
      "Feature-based transfer is one of the most effective methodologies for transfer learning. Existing studies usually assume that the learned new feature representation is truly \\emph{domain-invariant}, and thus directly train a transfer model $\\mathcal{M}$ on source domain. In this paper, we consider a more realistic scenario where the new feature representation is suboptimal and small divergence still exists across domains. We propose a new learning strategy with a transfer model called Randomized Transferable Machine (RTM). More specifically, we work on source data with the new feature representation learned from existing feature-based transfer methods. The key idea is to enlarge source training data populations by randomly corrupting source data using some noises, and then train a transfer model $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}$ that performs well on all the corrupted source data populations. In principle, the more corruptions are made, the higher the probability of the target data can be covered by the constructed source populations, and thus better transfer performance can be achieved by $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}$. An ideal case is with infinite corruptions, which however is infeasible in reality. We develop a marginalized solution with linear regression model and dropout noise. With a marginalization trick, we can train an RTM that is equivalently to training using infinite source noisy populations without truly conducting any corruption. More importantly, such an RTM has a closed-form solution, which enables very fast and efficient training. Extensive experiments on various real-world transfer tasks show that RTM is a promising transfer model.\n",
      "We apply a Transformer architecture, specifically BERT, to learn flexible and high quality molecular representations for drug discovery problems. We study the impact of using different combinations of self-supervised tasks for pre-training, and present our results for the established Virtual Screening and QSAR benchmarks. We show that: i) The selection of appropriate self-supervised task(s) for pre-training has a significant impact on performance in subsequent downstream tasks such as Virtual Screening. ii) Using auxiliary tasks with more domain relevance for Chemistry, such as learning to predict calculated molecular properties, increases the fidelity of our learnt representations. iii) Finally, we show that molecular representations learnt by our model `MolBert' improve upon the current state of the art on the benchmark datasets.\n",
      "Retrieving unlabeled videos by textual queries, known as Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS), is a core theme in multimedia data management and retrieval. The success of AVS counts on cross-modal representation learning that encodes both query sentences and videos into common spaces for semantic similarity computation. Inspired by the initial success of previously few works in combining multiple sentence encoders, this paper takes a step forward by developing a new and general method for effectively exploiting diverse sentence encoders. The novelty of the proposed method, which we term Sentence Encoder Assembly (SEA), is two-fold. First, different from prior art that use only a single common space, SEA supports text-video matching in multiple encoder-specific common spaces. Such a property prevents the matching from being dominated by a specific encoder that produces an encoding vector much longer than other encoders. Second, in order to explore complementarities among the individual common spaces, we propose multi-space multi-loss learning. As extensive experiments on four benchmarks (MSR-VTT, TRECVID AVS 2016-2019, TGIF and MSVD) show, SEA surpasses the state-of-the-art. In addition, SEA is extremely ease to implement. All this makes SEA an appealing solution for AVS and promising for continuously advancing the task by harvesting new sentence encoders.\n",
      "Graph embedding (GE) methods embed nodes (and/or edges) in graph into a low-dimensional semantic space, and have shown its effectiveness in modeling multi-relational data. However, existing GE models are not practical in real-world applications since it overlooked the streaming nature of incoming data. To address this issue, we study the problem of continual graph representation learning which aims to continually train a GE model on new data to learn incessantly emerging multi-relational data while avoiding catastrophically forgetting old learned knowledge. Moreover, we propose a disentangle-based continual graph representation learning (DiCGRL) framework inspired by the human's ability to learn procedural knowledge. The experimental results show that DiCGRL could effectively alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem and outperform state-of-the-art continual learning models.\n",
      "We propose a model-agnostic pipeline to recover graph signals from an expert system by exploiting the content addressable memory property of restricted Boltzmann machine and the representational ability of a neural network. The proposed pipeline requires the deep neural network that is trained on a downward machine learning task with clean data, data which is free from any form of corruption or incompletion. We show that denoising the representations learned by the deep neural networks is usually more effective than denoising the data itself. Although this pipeline can deal with noise in any dataset, it is particularly effective for graph-structured datasets.\n",
      "Patient representation learning refers to learning a dense mathematical representation of a patient that encodes meaningful information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This is generally performed using advanced deep learning methods. This study presents a systematic review of this field and provides both qualitative and quantitative analyses from a methodological perspective. We identified studies developing patient representations from EHRs with deep learning methods from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore Digital Library. After screening 363 articles, 49 papers were included for a comprehensive data collection. We noticed a typical workflow starting with feeding raw data, applying deep learning models, and ending with clinical outcome predictions as evaluations of the learned representations. Specifically, learning representations from structured EHR data was dominant (37 out of 49 studies). Recurrent Neural Networks were widely applied as the deep learning architecture (LSTM: 13 studies, GRU: 11 studies). Disease prediction was the most common application and evaluation (31 studies). Benchmark datasets were mostly unavailable (28 studies) due to privacy concerns of EHR data, and code availability was assured in 20 studies. We show the importance and feasibility of learning comprehensive representations of patient EHR data through a systematic review. Advances in patient representation learning techniques will be essential for powering patient-level EHR analyses. Future work will still be devoted to leveraging the richness and potential of available EHR data. Knowledge distillation and advanced learning techniques will be exploited to assist the capability of learning patient representation further.\n",
      "With the rapid emergence of graph representation learning, the construction of new large-scale datasets are necessary to distinguish model capabilities and accurately assess the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. By carefully analyzing existing graph databases, we identify 3 critical components important for advancing the field of graph representation learning: (1) large graphs, (2) many graphs, and (3) class diversity. To date, no single graph database offers all of these desired properties. We introduce MalNet, the largest public graph database ever constructed, representing a large-scale ontology of software function call graphs. MalNet contains over 1.2 million graphs, averaging over 17k nodes and 39k edges per graph, across a hierarchy of 47 types and 696 families. Compared to the popular REDDIT-12K database, MalNet offers 105x more graphs, 44x larger graphs on average, and 63x the classes. We provide a detailed analysis of MalNet, discussing its properties and provenance. The unprecedented scale and diversity of MalNet offers exciting opportunities to advance the frontiers of graph representation learning---enabling new discoveries and research into imbalanced classification, explainability and the impact of class hardness. The database is publically available at www.mal-net.org.\n",
      "Intelligently reasoning about the world often requires integrating data from multiple modalities, as any individual modality may contain unreliable or incomplete information. Prior work in multimodal learning fuses input modalities only after significant independent processing. On the other hand, the brain performs multimodal processing almost immediately. This divide between conventional multimodal learning and neuroscience suggests that a detailed study of early multimodal fusion could improve artificial multimodal representations. To facilitate the study of early multimodal fusion, we create a convolutional LSTM network architecture that simultaneously processes both audio and visual inputs, and allows us to select the layer at which audio and visual information combines. Our results demonstrate that immediate fusion of audio and visual inputs in the initial C-LSTM layer results in higher performing networks that are more robust to the addition of white noise in both audio and visual inputs.\n",

We also show that we achieve higher precision than Open Targets, the leading initiative for target identification, with respect to predicting drug targets in clinical trials for Parkinson's disease.\n",
      "Graph neural networks~(GNNs) apply deep learning techniques to graph-structured data and have achieved promising performance in graph representation learning. However, existing GNNs rely heavily on enough labels or well-designed negative samples. To address these issues, we propose a new self-supervised graph representation method: deep graph bootstrapping~(DGB). DGB consists of two neural networks: online and target networks, and the input of them are different augmented views of the initial graph. The online network is trained to predict the target network while the target network is updated with a slow-moving average of the online network, which means the online and target networks can learn from each other. As a result, the proposed DGB can learn graph representation without negative examples in an unsupervised manner. In addition, we summarize three kinds of augmentation methods for graph-structured data and apply them to the DGB. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show the DGB performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods and how the augmentation methods affect the performances.\n",
      "In this study, we present a dynamic graph representation learning model on weighted graphs to accurately predict the network capacity of connections between viewers in a live video streaming event. We propose EGAD, a neural network architecture to capture the graph evolution by introducing a self-attention mechanism on the weights between consecutive graph convolutional networks. In addition, we account for the fact that neural architectures require a huge amount of parameters to train, thus increasing the online inference latency and negatively influencing the user experience in a live video streaming event. To address the problem of the high online inference of a vast number of parameters, we propose a knowledge distillation strategy. In particular, we design a distillation loss function, aiming to first pretrain a teacher model on offline data, and then transfer the knowledge from the teacher to a smaller student model with less parameters. We evaluate our proposed model on the link prediction task on three real-world datasets, generated by live video streaming events. The events lasted 80 minutes and each viewer exploited the distribution solution provided by the company Hive Streaming AB. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of link prediction accuracy and number of required parameters, when evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we study the distillation performance of the proposed model in terms of compression ratio for different distillation strategies, where we show that the proposed model can achieve a compression ratio up to 15:100, preserving high link prediction accuracy. For reproduction purposes, our evaluation datasets and implementation are publicly available at https://stefanosantaris.github.io/EGAD.\n",
      "Dynamic graph representation learning strategies are based on different neural architectures to capture the graph evolution over time. However, the underlying neural architectures require a large amount of parameters to train and suffer from high online inference latency, that is several model parameters have to be updated when new data arrive online. In this study we propose Distill2Vec, a knowledge distillation strategy to train a compact model with a low number of trainable parameters, so as to reduce the latency of online inference and maintain the model accuracy high. We design a distillation loss function based on Kullback-Leibler divergence to transfer the acquired knowledge from a teacher model trained on offline data, to a small-size student model for online data. Our experiments with publicly available datasets show the superiority of our proposed model over several state-of-the-art approaches with relative gains up to 5% in the link prediction task. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our knowledge distillation strategy, in terms of number of required parameters, where Distill2Vec achieves a compression ratio up to 7:100 when compared with baseline approaches.

      "To date, research on sensor-equipped mobile devices has primarily focused on the purely supervised task of human activity recognition (walking, running, etc), demonstrating limited success in inferring high-level health outcomes from low-level signals, such as acceleration. Here, we present a novel self-supervised representation learning method using activity and heart rate (HR) signals without semantic labels. With a deep neural network, we set HR responses as the supervisory signal for the activity data, leveraging their underlying physiological relationship.   We evaluate our model in the largest free-living combined-sensing dataset (comprising more than 280,000 hours of wrist accelerometer & wearable ECG data) and show that the resulting embeddings can generalize in various downstream tasks through transfer learning with linear classifiers, capturing physiologically meaningful, personalized information. For instance, they can be used to predict (higher than 70 AUC) variables associated with individuals' health, fitness and demographic characteristics, outperforming unsupervised autoencoders and common bio-markers. Overall, we propose the first multimodal self-supervised method for behavioral and physiological data with implications for large-scale health and lifestyle monitoring.\n",
      "Graph neural network (GNN) has recently been established as an effective representation learning framework on graph data. However, the popular message passing models rely on local permutation invariant aggregate functions, which gives rise to the concerns about their representational power. Here, we introduce the concept of automorphic equivalence to theoretically analyze GNN's expressiveness in differentiating node's structural role. We show that the existing message passing GNNs have limitations in learning expressive representations. Moreover, we design a novel GNN class that leverages learnable automorphic equivalence filters to explicitly differentiate the structural roles of each node's neighbors, and uses a squeeze-and-excitation module to fuse various structural information. We theoretically prove that the proposed model is expressive in terms of generating distinct representations for nodes with different structural feature. Besides, we empirically validate our model on eight real-world graph data, including social network, e-commerce co-purchase network and citation network, and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines.\n",
      "Progress in the field of machine learning has been fueled by the introduction of benchmark datasets pushing the limits of existing algorithms. Enabling the design of datasets to test specific properties and failure modes of learning algorithms is thus a problem of high interest, as it has a direct impact on innovation in the field. In this sense, we introduce Synbols -- Synthetic Symbols -- a tool for rapidly generating new datasets with a rich composition of latent features rendered in low resolution images. Synbols leverages the large amount of symbols available in the Unicode standard and the wide range of artistic font provided by the open font community. Our tool's high-level interface provides a language for rapidly generating new distributions on the latent features, including various types of textures and occlusions.

      "Potential-based reward shaping provides an approach for designing good reward functions, with the purpose of speeding up learning. However, automatically finding potential functions for complex environments is a difficult problem (in fact, of the same difficulty as learning a value function from scratch). We propose a new framework for learning potential functions by leveraging ideas from graph representation learning. Our approach relies on Graph Convolutional Networks which we use as a key ingredient in combination with the probabilistic inference view of reinforcement learning. More precisely, we leverage Graph Convolutional Networks to perform message passing from rewarding states. The propagated messages can then be used as potential functions for reward shaping to accelerate learning. We verify empirically that our approach can achieve considerable improvements in both small and high-dimensional control problems.\n",
      "Many real-world video-text tasks involve different levels of granularity, such as frames and words, clip and sentences or videos and paragraphs, each with distinct semantics. In this paper, we propose a Cooperative hierarchical Transformer (COOT) to leverage this hierarchy information and model the interactions between different levels of granularity and different modalities. The method consists of three major components: an attention-aware feature aggregation layer, which leverages the local temporal context (intra-level, e.g., within a clip), a contextual transformer to learn the interactions between low-level and high-level semantics (inter-level, e.g. clip-video, sentence-paragraph), and a cross-modal cycle-consistency loss to connect video and text. The resulting method compares favorably to the state of the art on several benchmarks while having few parameters. All code is available open-source at https://github.com/gingsi/coot-videotext\n",
      "We present a Reverse Reinforcement Learning (Reverse RL) approach for representing retrospective knowledge. General Value Functions (GVFs) have enjoyed great success in representing predictive knowledge, i.e., answering questions about possible future outcomes such as \"how much fuel will be consumed in expectation if we drive from A to B?\". GVFs, however, cannot answer questions like \"how much fuel do we expect a car to have given it is at B at time $t$?\". To answer this question, we need to know when that car had a full tank and how that car came to B. Since such questions emphasize the influence of possible past events on the present, we refer to their answers as retrospective knowledge. In this paper, we show how to represent retrospective knowledge with Reverse GVFs, which are trained via Reverse RL. We demonstrate empirically the utility of Reverse GVFs in both representation learning and anomaly detection.\n",
      "This paper reviews the novel concept of controllable variational autoencoder (ControlVAE), discusses its parameter tuning to meet application needs, derives its key analytic properties, and offers useful extensions and applications. ControlVAE is a new variational autoencoder (VAE) framework that combines the automatic control theory with the basic VAE to stabilize the KL-divergence of VAE models to a specified value. It leverages a non-linear PI controller, a variant of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, to dynamically tune the weight of the KL-divergence term in the evidence lower bound (ELBO) using the output KL-divergence as feedback. This allows us to precisely control the KL-divergence to a desired value (set point), which is effective in avoiding posterior collapse and learning disentangled representations. In order to improve the ELBO over the regular VAE, we provide simplified theoretical analysis to inform setting the set point of KL-divergence for ControlVAE. We observe that compared to other methods that seek to balance the two terms in VAE's objective, ControlVAE leads to better learning dynamics. In particular, it can achieve a good trade-off between reconstruction quality and KL-divergence. We evaluate the proposed method on three tasks: image generation, language modeling and disentangled representation learning. The results show that ControlVAE can achieve much better reconstruction quality than the other methods for comparable disentanglement. On the language modeling task, ControlVAE can avoid posterior collapse (KL vanishing) and improve the diversity of generated text. Moreover, our method can change the optimization trajectory, improving the ELBO and the reconstruction quality for image generation.\n",
      "Studies recently accomplished on the Enteric Nervous System have shown that chronic degenerative diseases affect the Enteric Glial Cells (EGC) and, thus, the development of recognition methods able to identify whether or not the EGC are affected by these type of diseases may be helpful in its diagnoses. In this work, we propose the use of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to evaluate if a given animal EGC image was obtained from a healthy individual or one affect by a chronic degenerative disease. In the proposed approach, we have performed the classification task with handcrafted features and deep learning based techniques, also known as non-handcrafted features. The handcrafted features were obtained from the textural content of the ECG images using texture descriptors, such as the Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Moreover, the representation learning techniques employed in the approach are based on different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, such as AlexNet and VGG16, with and without transfer learning. The complementarity between the handcrafted and non-handcrafted features was also evaluated with late fusion techniques. The datasets of EGC images used in the experiments, which are also contributions of this paper, are composed of three different chronic degenerative diseases: Cancer, Diabetes Mellitus, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. The experimental results, supported by statistical analysis, shown that the proposed approach can distinguish healthy cells from the sick ones with a recognition rate of 89.30% (Rheumatoid Arthritis), 98.45% (Cancer), and 95.13% (Diabetes Mellitus), being achieved by combining classifiers obtained both feature scenarios.\n",
      "Frequency spectrum has played a significant role in learning unique and discriminating features for object recognition. Both low and high frequency information present in images have been extracted and learnt by a host of representation learning techniques, including deep learning. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel class of adversarial attacks, namely `WaveTransform', that creates adversarial noise corresponding to low-frequency and high-frequency subbands, separately (or in combination). The frequency subbands are analyzed using wavelet decomposition; the subbands are corrupted and then used to construct an adversarial example. Experiments are performed using multiple databases and CNN models to establish the effectiveness of the proposed WaveTransform attack and analyze the importance of a particular frequency component. The robustness of the proposed attack is also evaluated through its transferability and resiliency against a recent adversarial defense algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed attack is effective against the defense algorithm and is also transferable across CNNs.\n",
      "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can use high-capacity deep networks to learn directly from image observations. However, these high-dimensional observation spaces present a number of challenges in practice, since the policy must now solve two problems: representation learning and task learning. In this work, we tackle these two problems separately, by explicitly learning latent representations that can accelerate reinforcement learning from images. We propose the stochastic latent actor-critic (SLAC) algorithm: a sample-efficient and high-performing RL algorithm for learning policies for complex continuous control tasks directly from high-dimensional image inputs. SLAC provides a novel and principled approach for unifying stochastic sequential models and RL into a single method, by learning a compact latent representation and then performing RL in the model's learned latent space. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method outperforms both model-free and model-based alternatives in terms of final performance and sample efficiency, on a range of difficult image-based control tasks. Our code and videos of our results are available at our website.\n",
      "Many important problems can be formulated as reasoning in knowledge graphs. Representation learning has proved extremely effective for transductive reasoning, in which one needs to make new predictions for already observed entities. This is true for both attributed graphs(where each entity has an initial feature vector) and non-attributed graphs (where the only initial information derives from known relations with other entities). For out-of-sample reasoning, where one needs to make predictions for entities that were unseen at training time, much prior work considers attributed graph. However, this problem is surprisingly under-explored for non-attributed graphs. In this paper, we study the out-of-sample representation learning problem for non-attributed knowledge graphs, create benchmark datasets for this task, develop several models and baselines, and provide empirical analyses and comparisons of the proposed models and baselines.\n",
      "3D Point clouds are a rich source of information that enjoy growing popularity in the vision community. However, due to the sparsity of their representation, learning models based on large point clouds is still a challenge. In this work, we introduce Graphite, a GRAPH-Induced feaTure Extraction pipeline, a simple yet powerful feature transform and keypoint detector. Graphite enables intensive down-sampling of point clouds with keypoint detection accompanied by a descriptor. We construct a generic graph-based learning scheme to describe point cloud regions and extract salient points. To this end, we take advantage of 6D pose information and metric learning to learn robust descriptions and keypoints across different scans. We Reformulate the 3D keypoint pipeline with graph neural networks which allow efficient processing of the point set while boosting its descriptive power which ultimately results in more accurate 3D registrations. We demonstrate our lightweight descriptor on common 3D descriptor matching and point cloud registration benchmarks and achieve comparable results with the state of the art. Describing 100 patches of a point cloud and detecting their keypoints takes only ~0.018 seconds with our proposed network.\n",
      "To leverage enormous unlabeled data on distributed edge devices, we formulate a new problem in federated learning called Federated Unsupervised Representation Learning (FURL) to learn a common representation model without supervision while preserving data privacy. FURL poses two new challenges: (1) data distribution shift (Non-IID distribution) among clients would make local models focus on different categories, leading to the inconsistency of representation spaces. (2) without the unified information among clients in FURL, the representations across clients would be misaligned. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Constrastive Averaging with dictionary and alignment (FedCA) algorithm. FedCA is composed of two key modules: (1) dictionary module to aggregate the representations of samples from each client and share with all clients for consistency of representation space and (2) alignment module to align the representation of each client on a base model trained on a public data. We adopt the contrastive loss for local model training. Through extensive experiments with three evaluation protocols in IID and Non-IID settings, we demonstrate that FedCA outperforms all baselines with significant margins.\n",
      "We present $\\Gamma$-nets, a method for generalizing value function estimation over timescale. By using the timescale as one of the estimator's inputs we can estimate value for arbitrary timescales. As a result, the prediction target for any timescale is available and we are free to train on multiple timescales at each timestep. Here we empirically evaluate $\\Gamma$-nets in the policy evaluation setting. We first demonstrate the approach on a square wave and then on a robot arm using linear function approximation. Next, we consider the deep reinforcement learning setting using several Atari video games. Our results show that $\\Gamma$-nets can be effective for predicting arbitrary timescales, with only a small cost in accuracy as compared to learning estimators for fixed timescales. $\\Gamma$-nets provide a method for compactly making predictions at many timescales without requiring a priori knowledge of the task, making it a valuable contribution to ongoing work on model-based planning, representation learning, and lifelong learning algorithms.\n",
      "Knowledge graph (KG) representation learning methods have achieved competitive performance in many KG-oriented tasks, among which the best ones are usually based on graph neural networks (GNNs), a powerful family of networks that learns the representation of an entity by aggregating the features of its neighbors and itself. However, many KG representation learning scenarios only provide the structure information that describes the relationships among entities, causing that entities have no input features. In this case, existing aggregation mechanisms are incapable of inducing embeddings of unseen entities as these entities have no pre-defined features for aggregation. In this paper, we present a decentralized KG representation learning approach, decentRL, which encodes each entity from and only from the embeddings of its neighbors. For optimization, we design an algorithm to distill knowledge from the model itself such that the output embeddings can continuously gain knowledge from the corresponding original embeddings. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach performed better than many cutting-edge models on the entity alignment task, and achieved competitive performance on the entity prediction task. Furthermore, under the inductive setting, it significantly outperformed all baselines on both tasks.\n",
      "In this paper, we introduce InstantEmbedding, an efficient method for generating single-node representations using local PageRank computations. We theoretically prove that our approach produces globally consistent representations in sublinear time. We demonstrate this empirically by conducting extensive experiments on real-world datasets with over a billion edges. Our experiments confirm that InstantEmbedding requires drastically less computation time (over 9,000 times faster) and less memory (by over 8,000 times) to produce a single node's embedding than traditional methods including DeepWalk, node2vec, VERSE, and FastRP. We also show that our method produces high quality representations, demonstrating results that meet or exceed the state of the art for unsupervised representation learning on tasks like node classification and link prediction.\n",
      "In this paper, we address self-supervised representation learning from human skeletons for action recognition. Previous methods, which usually learn feature presentations from a single reconstruction task, may come across the overfitting problem, and the features are not generalizable for action recognition. Instead, we propose to integrate multiple tasks to learn more general representations in a self-supervised manner. To realize this goal, we integrate motion prediction, jigsaw puzzle recognition, and contrastive learning to learn skeleton features from different aspects. Skeleton dynamics can be modeled through motion prediction by predicting the future sequence. And temporal patterns, which are critical for action recognition, are learned through solving jigsaw puzzles. We further regularize the feature space by contrastive learning. Besides, we explore different training strategies to utilize the knowledge from self-supervised tasks for action recognition. We evaluate our multi-task self-supervised learning approach with action classifiers trained under different configurations, including unsupervised, semi-supervised and fully-supervised settings. Our experiments on the NW-UCLA, NTU RGB+D, and PKUMMD datasets show remarkable performance for action recognition, demonstrating the superiority of our method in learning more discriminative and general features.

      "Representation Learning in a heterogeneous space with mixed variables of numerical and categorical types has interesting challenges due to its complex feature manifold. Moreover, feature learning in an unsupervised setup, without class labels and a suitable learning loss function, adds to the problem complexity. Further, the learned representation and subsequent predictions should not reflect discriminatory behavior towards certain sensitive groups or attributes. The proposed feature map should preserve maximum variations present in the data and needs to be fair with respect to the sensitive variables. We propose, in the first phase of our work, an efficient encoder-decoder framework to capture the mixed-domain information. The second phase of our work focuses on de-biasing the mixed space representations by adding relevant fairness constraints. This ensures minimal information loss between the representations before and after the fairness-preserving projections. Both the information content and the fairness aspect of the final representation learned has been validated through several metrics where it shows excellent performance. Our work (FairMixRep) addresses the problem of Mixed Space Fair Representation learning from an unsupervised perspective and learns a Universal representation that is timely, unique, and a novel research contribution.\n",
      "Over the past decade, multivariate time series classification (MTSC) has received great attention with the advance of sensing techniques. Current deep learning methods for MTSC are based on convolutional and recurrent neural network, with the assumption that time series variables have the same effect to each other. Thus they cannot model the pairwise dependencies among variables explicitly. What's more, current spatial-temporal modeling methods based on GNNs are inherently flat and lack the capability of aggregating node information in a hierarchical manner. To address this limitation and attain expressive global representation of MTS, we propose a graph pooling based framework MTPool and view MTSC task as graph classification task. With graph structure learning and temporal convolution, MTS slices are converted to graphs and spatial-temporal features are extracted. Then, we propose a novel graph pooling method, which uses an ``encoder-decoder'' mechanism to generate adaptive centroids for cluster assignments. GNNs and graph pooling layers are used for joint graph representation learning and graph coarsening. With multiple graph pooling layers, the input graphs are hierachically coarsened to one node. Finally, differentiable classifier takes this coarsened one-node graph as input to get the final predicted class. Experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate MTPool outperforms state-of-the-art methods in MTSC tasks.\n",
      "Graph Neural Network (GNN) aggregates the neighborhood of each node into the node embedding and shows its powerful capability for graph representation learning. However, most existing GNN variants aggregate the neighborhood information in a fixed non-injective fashion, which may map different graphs or nodes to the same embedding, reducing the model expressiveness. We present a theoretical framework to design a continuous injective set function for neighborhood aggregation in GNN. Using the framework, we propose expressive GNN that aggregates the neighborhood of each node with a continuous injective set function, so that a GNN layer maps similar nodes with similar neighborhoods to similar embeddings, different nodes to different embeddings and the equivalent nodes or isomorphic graphs to the same embeddings. Moreover, the proposed expressive GNN can naturally learn expressive representations for graphs with continuous node attributes. We validate the proposed expressive GNN (ExpGNN) for graph classification on multiple benchmark datasets including simple graphs and attributed graphs. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances on most of the benchmarks.\n",
      "In this work we consider partially observable environments with sparse rewards. We present a self-supervised representation learning method for image-based observations, which arranges embeddings respecting temporal distance of observations. This representation is empirically robust to stochasticity and suitable for novelty detection from the error of a predictive forward model. We consider episodic and life-long uncertainties to guide the exploration. We propose to estimate the missing information about the environment with the world model, which operates in the learned latent space. As a motivation of the method, we analyse the exploration problem in a tabular Partially Observable Labyrinth. We demonstrate the method on image-based hard exploration environments from the Atari benchmark and report significant improvement with respect to prior work. The source code of the method and all the experiments is available at https://github.com/htdt/lwm.\n",
      "Multivariate time series (MTS) data are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in diverse domains, e.g., IoT systems, health informatics, and 5G networks. To obtain an effective representation of MTS data, it is not only essential to consider unpredictable dynamics and highly variable lengths of these data but also important to address the irregularities in the sampling rates of MTS. Existing parametric approaches rely on manual hyperparameter tuning and may cost a huge amount of labor effort. Therefore, it is desirable to learn the representation automatically and efficiently. To this end, we propose an autonomous representation learning approach for multivariate time series (TimeAutoML) with irregular sampling rates and variable lengths. As opposed to previous works, we first present a representation learning pipeline in which the configuration and hyperparameter optimization are fully automatic and can be tailored for various tasks, e.g., anomaly detection, clustering, etc. Next, a negative sample generation approach and an auxiliary classification task are developed and integrated within TimeAutoML to enhance its representation capability. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TimeAutoML outperforms competing approaches on various tasks by a large margin. In fact, it achieves the best anomaly detection performance among all comparison algorithms on 78 out of all 85 UCR datasets, acquiring up to 20% performance improvement in terms of AUC score.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning with function approximation can be unstable and even divergent, especially when combined with off-policy learning and Bellman updates. In deep reinforcement learning, these issues have been dealt with empirically by adapting and regularizing the representation, in particular with auxiliary tasks. This suggests that representation learning may provide a means to guarantee stability. In this paper, we formally show that there are indeed nontrivial state representations under which the canonical TD algorithm is stable, even when learning off-policy. We analyze representation learning schemes that are based on the transition matrix of a policy, such as proto-value functions, along three axes: approximation error, stability, and ease of estimation. In the most general case, we show that a Schur basis provides convergence guarantees, but is difficult to estimate from samples. For a fixed reward function, we find that an orthogonal basis of the corresponding Krylov subspace is an even better choice. We conclude by empirically demonstrating that these stable representations can be learned using stochastic gradient descent, opening the door to improved techniques for representation learning with deep networks.\n",
      "Event-based cameras record an asynchronous stream of per-pixel brightness changes. As such, they have numerous advantages over the standard frame-based cameras, including high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. Due to the asynchronous nature, efficient learning of compact representation for event data is challenging. While it remains not explored the extent to which the spatial and temporal event \"information\" is useful for pattern recognition tasks. In this paper, we focus on single-layer architectures. We analyze the performance of two general problem formulations: the direct and the inverse, for unsupervised feature learning from local event data (local volumes of events described in space-time). We identify and show the main advantages of each approach. Theoretically, we analyze guarantees for an optimal solution, possibility for asynchronous, parallel parameter update, and the computational complexity. We present numerical experiments for object recognition. We evaluate the solution under the direct and the inverse problem and give a comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. Our empirical results highlight the advantages of both approaches for representation learning from event data. We show improvements of up to 9 % in the recognition accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods from the same class of methods.\n",
      "Representation learning has been proven to play an important role in the unprecedented success of machine learning models in numerous tasks, such as machine translation, face recognition and recommendation. The majority of existing representation learning approaches often require a large number of consistent and noise-free labels. However, due to various reasons such as budget constraints and privacy concerns, labels are very limited in many real-world scenarios. Directly applying standard representation learning approaches on small labeled data sets will easily run into over-fitting problems and lead to sub-optimal solutions. Even worse, in some domains such as education, the limited labels are usually annotated by multiple workers with diverse expertise, which yields noises and inconsistency in such crowdsourcing settings. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which aims to learn effective representations from limited data with crowdsourced labels. Specifically, we design a grouping based deep neural network to learn embeddings from a limited number of training samples and present a Bayesian confidence estimator to capture the inconsistency among crowdsourced labels. Furthermore, to expedite the training process, we develop a hard example selection procedure to adaptively pick up training examples that are misclassified by the model. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of our framework on learning representations from limited data with crowdsourced labels, comparing with various state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis on each of the main components of our proposed framework and also introduce the promising results it achieved in our real production to fully understand the proposed framework.\n",
      "Representation learning is a fundamental building block for analyzing entities in a database. While the existing embedding learning methods are effective in various data mining problems, their applicability is often limited because these methods have pre-determined assumptions on the type of semantics captured by the learned embeddings, and the assumptions may not well align with specific downstream tasks. In this work, we propose an embedding learning framework that 1) uses an input format that is agnostic to input data type, 2) is flexible in terms of the relationships that can be embedded into the learned representations, and 3) provides an intuitive pathway to incorporate domain knowledge into the embedding learning process. Our proposed framework utilizes a set of entity-relation-matrices as the input, which quantifies the affinities among different entities in the database. Moreover, a sampling mechanism is carefully designed to establish a direct connection between the input and the information captured by the output embeddings. To complete the representation learning toolbox, we also outline a simple yet effective post-processing technique to properly visualize the learned embeddings. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed framework, in conjunction with a set of relevant entity-relation-matrices, outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in various data mining tasks.\n",
      "This paper introduces an automated skill acquisition framework in reinforcement learning which involves identifying a hierarchical description of the given task in terms of abstract states and extended actions between abstract states. Identifying such structures present in the task provides ways to simplify and speed up reinforcement learning algorithms. These structures also help to generalize such algorithms over multiple tasks without relearning policies from scratch. We use ideas from dynamical systems to find metastable regions in the state space and associate them with abstract states. The spectral clustering algorithm PCCA+ is used to identify suitable abstractions aligned to the underlying structure. Skills are defined in terms of the sequence of actions that lead to transitions between such abstract states. The connectivity information from PCCA+ is used to generate these skills or options. These skills are independent of the learning task and can be efficiently reused across a variety of tasks defined over the same model. This approach works well even without the exact model of the environment by using sample trajectories to construct an approximate estimate. We also present our approach to scaling the skill acquisition framework to complex tasks with large state spaces for which we perform state aggregation using the representation learned from an action conditional video prediction network and use the skill acquisition framework on the aggregated state space.\n",
      "The contemporary process-aware information systems possess the capabilities to record the activities generated during the process execution. To leverage these process specific fine-granular data, process mining has recently emerged as a promising research discipline. As an important branch of process mining, predictive business process management, pursues the objective to generate forward-looking, predictive insights to shape business processes. In this study, we propose a conceptual framework sought to establish and promote understanding of decision-making environment, underlying business processes and nature of the user characteristics for developing explainable business process prediction solutions. Consequently, with regard to the theoretical and practical implications of the framework, this study proposes a novel local post-hoc explanation approach for a deep learning classifier that is expected to facilitate the domain experts in justifying the model decisions. In contrary to alternative popular perturbation-based local explanation approaches, this study defines the local regions from the validation dataset by using the intermediate latent space representations learned by the deep neural networks. To validate the applicability of the proposed explanation method, the real-life process log data delivered by the Volvo IT Belgium's incident management system are used.The adopted deep learning classifier achieves a good performance with the Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.94. The generated local explanations are also visualized and presented with relevant evaluation measures that are expected to increase the users' trust in the black-box-model.\n",
      "In deep representational learning, it is often desired to isolate a particular factor (termed {\\em content}) from other factors (referred to as {\\em style}). What constitutes the content is typically specified by users through explicit labels in the data, while all unlabeled/unknown factors are regarded as style. Recently, it has been shown that such content-labeled data can be effectively exploited by modifying the deep latent factor models (e.g., VAE) such that the style and content are well separated in the latent representations. However, the approach assumes that the content factor is categorical-valued (e.g., subject ID in face image data, or digit class in the MNIST dataset). In certain situations, the content is ordinal-valued, that is, the values the content factor takes are {\\em ordered} rather than categorical, making content-labeled VAEs, including the latent space they infer, suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of VAE that imposes a partially ordered set (poset) structure in the content latent space, while simultaneously making it aligned with the ordinal content values. To this end, instead of the iid Gaussian latent prior adopted in prior approaches, we introduce a conditional Gaussian spacing prior model. This model admits a tractable joint Gaussian prior, but also effectively places negligible density values on the content latent configurations that violate the poset constraint. To evaluate this model, we consider two specific ordinal structured problems: estimating a subject's age in a face image and elucidating the calorie amount in a food meal image. We demonstrate significant improvements in content-style separation over previous non-ordinal approaches.\n",
      "Finding general evaluation metrics for unsupervised representation learning techniques is a challenging open research question, which recently has become more and more necessary due to the increasing interest in unsupervised methods. Even though these methods promise beneficial representation characteristics, most approaches currently suffer from the objective function mismatch. This mismatch states that the performance on a desired target task can decrease when the unsupervised pretext task is learned too long - especially when both tasks are ill-posed. In this work, we build upon the widely used linear evaluation protocol and define new general evaluation metrics to quantitatively capture the objective function mismatch and the more generic metrics mismatch. We discuss the usability and stability of our protocols on a variety of pretext and target tasks and study mismatches in a wide range of experiments. Thereby we disclose dependencies of the objective function mismatch across several pretext and target tasks with respect to the pretext model's representation size, target model complexity, pretext and target augmentations as well as pretext and target task types.\n",
      "Due to the hierarchical structure of many machine learning problems, bilevel programming is becoming more and more important recently, however, the complicated correlation between the inner and outer problem makes it extremely challenging to solve. Although several intuitive algorithms based on the automatic differentiation have been proposed and obtained success in some applications, not much attention has been paid to finding the optimal formulation of the bilevel model. Whether there exists a better formulation is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose an improved bilevel model which converges faster and better compared to the current formulation. We provide theoretical guarantee and evaluation results over two tasks: Data Hyper-Cleaning and Hyper Representation Learning. The empirical results show that our model outperforms the current bilevel model with a great margin. \\emph{This is a concurrent work with \\citet{liu2020generic} and we submitted to ICML 2020.

      "Visual reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) require an interplay of visual perception with reasoning about the question semantics grounded in perception. However, recent advances in this area are still primarily driven by perception improvements (e.g. scene graph generation) rather than reasoning. Neuro-symbolic models such as Neural Module Networks bring the benefits of compositional reasoning to VQA, but they are still entangled with visual representation learning, and thus neural reasoning is hard to improve and assess on its own. To address this, we propose (1) a framework to isolate and evaluate the reasoning aspect of VQA separately from its perception, and (2) a novel top-down calibration technique that allows the model to answer reasoning questions even with imperfect perception. To this end, we introduce a differentiable first-order logic formalism for VQA that explicitly decouples question answering from visual perception. On the challenging GQA dataset, this framework is used to perform in-depth, disentangled comparisons between well-known VQA models leading to informative insights regarding the participating models as well as the task.\n",
      "Learning about many things can provide numerous benefits to a reinforcement learning system. For example, learning many auxiliary value functions, in addition to optimizing the environmental reward, appears to improve both exploration and representation learning. The question we tackle in this paper is how to sculpt the stream of experience---how to adapt the learning system's behavior---to optimize the learning of a collection of value functions. A simple answer is to compute an intrinsic reward based on the statistics of each auxiliary learner, and use reinforcement learning to maximize that intrinsic reward. Unfortunately, implementing this simple idea has proven difficult, and thus has been the focus of decades of study. It remains unclear which of the many possible measures of learning would work well in a parallel learning setting where environmental reward is extremely sparse or absent. In this paper, we investigate and compare different intrinsic reward mechanisms in a new bandit-like parallel-learning testbed. We discuss the interaction between reward and prediction learners and highlight the importance of introspective prediction learners: those that increase their rate of learning when progress is possible, and decrease when it is not. We provide a comprehensive empirical comparison of 14 different rewards, including well-known ideas from reinforcement learning and active learning. Our results highlight a simple but seemingly powerful principle: intrinsic rewards based on the amount of learning can generate useful behavior, if each individual learner is introspective.\n",
      "With the wide adoption of mobile devices, today's location tracking systems such as satellites, cellular base stations and wireless access points are continuously producing tremendous amounts of location data of moving objects. The ability to discover moving objects that travel together, i.e., traveling companions, from their trajectories is desired by many applications such as intelligent transportation systems and location-based services. Existing algorithms are either based on pattern mining methods that define a particular pattern of traveling companions or based on representation learning methods that learn similar representations for similar trajectories. The former methods suffer from the pairwise point-matching problem and the latter often ignore the temporal proximity between trajectories. In this work, we propose a generic deep representation learning model using autoencoders, namely, ATTN-MEAN, for the discovery of traveling companions. ATTN-MEAN collectively injects spatial and temporal information into its input embeddings using skip-gram, positional encoding techniques, respectively. Besides, our model further encourages trajectories to learn from their neighbours by leveraging the Sort-Tile-Recursive algorithm, mean operation and global attention mechanism. After obtaining the representations from the encoders, we run DBSCAN to cluster the representations to find travelling companion. The corresponding trajectories in the same cluster are considered as traveling companions. Experimental results suggest that ATTN-MEAN performs better than the state-of-the-art algorithms on finding traveling companions.\n",
      "Continual learning aims to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned ones. We hypothesize that representations learned to solve each task in a sequence have a shared structure while containing some task-specific properties. We show that shared features are significantly less prone to forgetting and propose a novel hybrid continual learning framework that learns a disjoint representation for task-invariant and task-specific features required to solve a sequence of tasks. Our model combines architecture growth to prevent forgetting of task-specific skills and an experience replay approach to preserve shared skills. We demonstrate our hybrid approach is effective in avoiding forgetting and show it is superior to both architecture-based and memory-based approaches on class incrementally learning of a single dataset as well as a sequence of multiple datasets in image classification. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/Adversarial-Continual-Learning}.\n",
      "The last decade has seen a flurry of research on all-pairs-similarity-search (or, self-join) for text, DNA, and a handful of other datatypes, and these systems have been applied to many diverse data mining problems. Surprisingly, however, little progress has been made on addressing this problem for time series subsequences. In this thesis, we have introduced a near universal time series data mining tool called matrix profile which solves the all-pairs-similarity-search problem and caches the output in an easy-to-access fashion. The proposed algorithm is not only parameter-free, exact and scalable, but also applicable for both single and multidimensional time series. By building time series data mining methods on top of matrix profile, many time series data mining tasks (e.g., motif discovery, discord discovery, shapelet discovery, semantic segmentation, and clustering) can be efficiently solved. Because the same matrix profile can be shared by a diverse set of time series data mining methods, matrix profile is versatile and computed-once-use-many-times data structure. We demonstrate the utility of matrix profile for many time series data mining problems, including motif discovery, discord discovery, weakly labeled time series classification, and representation learning on domains as diverse as seismology, entomology, music processing, bioinformatics, human activity monitoring, electrical power-demand monitoring, and medicine. We hope the matrix profile is not the end but the beginning of many more time series data mining projects.\n",
      "The graph structure of biomedical data differs from those in typical knowledge graph benchmark tasks. A particular property of biomedical data is the presence of long-range dependencies, which can be captured by patterns described as logical rules. We propose a novel method that combines these rules with a neural multi-hop reasoning approach that uses reinforcement learning. We conduct an empirical study based on the real-world task of drug repurposing by formulating this task as a link prediction problem. We apply our method to the biomedical knowledge graph Hetionet and show that our approach outperforms several baseline methods.\n",
      "Training an agent to solve control tasks directly from high-dimensional images with model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has proven difficult. A promising approach is to learn a latent representation together with the control policy. However, fitting a high-capacity encoder using a scarce reward signal is sample inefficient and leads to poor performance. Prior work has shown that auxiliary losses, such as image reconstruction, can aid efficient representation learning. However, incorporating reconstruction loss into an off-policy learning algorithm often leads to training instability. We explore the underlying reasons and identify variational autoencoders, used by previous investigations, as the cause of the divergence. Following these findings, we propose effective techniques to improve training stability. This results in a simple approach capable of matching state-of-the-art model-free and model-based algorithms on MuJoCo control tasks. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates robustness to observational noise, surpassing existing approaches in this setting.

      "A major challenge in modern reinforcement learning (RL) is efficient control of dynamical systems from high-dimensional sensory observations. Learning controllable embedding (LCE) is a promising approach that addresses this challenge by embedding the observations into a lower-dimensional latent space, estimating the latent dynamics, and utilizing it to perform control in the latent space. Two important questions in this area are how to learn a representation that is amenable to the control problem at hand, and how to achieve an end-to-end framework for representation learning and control. In this paper, we take a few steps towards addressing these questions. We first formulate a LCE model to learn representations that are suitable to be used by a policy iteration style algorithm in the latent space. We call this model control-aware representation learning (CARL). We derive a loss function for CARL that has close connection to the prediction, consistency, and curvature (PCC) principle for representation learning. We derive three implementations of CARL. In the offline implementation, we replace the locally-linear control algorithm (e.g.,~iLQR) used by the existing LCE methods with a RL algorithm, namely model-based soft actor-critic, and show that it results in significant improvement. In online CARL, we interleave representation learning and control, and demonstrate further gain in performance. Finally, we propose value-guided CARL, a variation in which we optimize a weighted version of the CARL loss function, where the weights depend on the TD-error of the current policy. We evaluate the proposed algorithms by extensive experiments on benchmark tasks and compare them with several LCE baselines.\n",
      "Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a statistical technique used to extract common information from multiple data sources or views. It has been used in various representation learning problems, such as dimensionality reduction, word embedding, and clustering. Recent work has given CCA probabilistic footing in a deep learning context and uses a variational lower bound for the data log likelihood to estimate model parameters. Alternatively, adversarial techniques have arisen in recent years as a powerful alternative to variational Bayesian methods in autoencoders. In this work, we explore straightforward adversarial alternatives to recent work in Deep Variational CCA (VCCA and VCCA-Private) we call ACCA and ACCA-Private and show how these approaches offer a stronger and more flexible way to match the approximate posteriors coming from encoders to much larger classes of priors than the VCCA and VCCA-Private models. This allows new priors for what constitutes a good representation, such as disentangling underlying factors of variation, to be more directly pursued. We offer further analysis on the multi-level disentangling properties of VCCA-Private and ACCA-Private through the use of a newly designed dataset we call Tangled MNIST. We also design a validation criteria for these models that is theoretically grounded, task-agnostic, and works well in practice. Lastly, we fill a minor research gap by deriving an additional variational lower bound for VCCA that allows the representation to use view-specific information from both input views.\n",
      "We present a novel architecture named Neural Physicist (NeurPhy) to learn physical dynamics directly from image sequences using deep neural networks. For any physical system, given the global system parameters, the time evolution of states is governed by the underlying physical laws. How to learn meaningful system representations in an end-to-end way and estimate accurate state transition dynamics facilitating long-term prediction have been long-standing challenges. In this paper, by leveraging recent progresses in representation learning and state space models (SSMs), we propose NeurPhy, which uses variational auto-encoder (VAE) to extract underlying Markovian dynamic state at each time step, neural process (NP) to extract the global system parameters, and a non-linear non-recurrent stochastic state space model to learn the physical dynamic transition. We apply NeurPhy to two physical experimental environments, i.e., damped pendulum and planetary orbits motion, and achieve promising results. Our model can not only extract the physically meaningful state representations, but also learn the state transition dynamics enabling long-term predictions for unseen image sequences. Furthermore, from the manifold dimension of the latent state space, we can easily identify the degree of freedom (DoF) of the underlying physical systems.\n",
      "The remarkable success of machine learning has fostered a growing number of cloud-based intelligent services for mobile users. Such a service requires a user to send data, e.g. image, voice and video, to the provider, which presents a serious challenge to user privacy. To address this, prior works either obfuscate the data, e.g. add noise and remove identity information, or send representations extracted from the data, e.g. anonymized features. They struggle to balance between the service utility and data privacy because obfuscated data reduces utility and extracted representation may still reveal sensitive information.   This work departs from prior works in methodology: we leverage adversarial learning to a better balance between privacy and utility. We design a \\textit{representation encoder} that generates the feature representations to optimize against the privacy disclosure risk of sensitive information (a measure of privacy) by the \\textit{privacy adversaries}, and concurrently optimize with the task inference accuracy (a measure of utility) by the \\textit{utility discriminator}. The result is the privacy adversarial network (\\systemname), a novel deep model with the new training algorithm, that can automatically learn representations from the raw data.   Intuitively, PAN adversarially forces the extracted representations to only convey the information required by the target task. Surprisingly, this constitutes an implicit regularization that actually improves task accuracy. As a result, PAN achieves better utility and better privacy at the same time! We report extensive experiments on six popular datasets and demonstrate the superiority of \\systemname compared with alternative methods reported in prior work.\n",
      "Extending the capabilities of robotics to real-world complex, unstructured environments requires the need of developing better perception systems while maintaining low sample complexity. When dealing with high-dimensional state spaces, current methods are either model-free or model-based based on reconstruction objectives. The sample inefficiency of the former constitutes a major barrier for applying them to the real-world. The later, while they present low sample complexity, they learn latent spaces that need to reconstruct every single detail of the scene. In real environments, the task typically just represents a small fraction of the scene. Reconstruction objectives suffer in such scenarios as they capture all the unnecessary components. In this work, we present MIRO, an information theoretic representational learning algorithm for model-based reinforcement learning. We design a latent space that maximizes the mutual information with the future information while being able to capture all the information needed for planning. We show that our approach is more robust than reconstruction objectives in the presence of distractors and cluttered scenes\n",
      "Designing agent that can autonomously discover and learn a diversity of structures and skills in unknown changing environments is key for lifelong machine learning. A central challenge is how to learn incrementally representations in order to progressively build a map of the discovered structures and re-use it to further explore. To address this challenge, we identify and target several key functionalities. First, we aim to build lasting representations and avoid catastrophic forgetting throughout the exploration process. Secondly we aim to learn a diversity of representations allowing to discover a \"diversity of diversity\" of structures (and associated skills) in complex high-dimensional environments. Thirdly, we target representations that can structure the agent discoveries in a coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, we target the reuse of such representations to drive exploration toward an \"interesting\" type of diversity, for instance leveraging human guidance. Current approaches in state representation learning rely generally on monolithic architectures which do not enable all these functionalities. Therefore, we present a novel technique to progressively construct a Hierarchy of Observation Latent Models for Exploration Stratification, called HOLMES. This technique couples the use of a dynamic modular model architecture for representation learning with intrinsically-motivated goal exploration processes (IMGEPs). The paper shows results in the domain of automated discovery of diverse self-organized patterns, considering as testbed the experimental framework from Reinke et al. (2019).\n",
      "In this paper we introduce plan2vec, an unsupervised representation learning approach that is inspired by reinforcement learning. Plan2vec constructs a weighted graph on an image dataset using near-neighbor distances, and then extrapolates this local metric to a global embedding by distilling path-integral over planned path. When applied to control, plan2vec offers a way to learn goal-conditioned value estimates that are accurate over long horizons that is both compute and sample efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of plan2vec on one simulated and two challenging real-world image datasets. Experimental results show that plan2vec successfully amortizes the planning cost, enabling reactive planning that is linear in memory and computation complexity rather than exhaustive over the entire state space.\n",
      "Learning a good representation is an essential component for deep reinforcement learning (RL). Representation learning is especially important in multitask and partially observable settings where building a representation of the unknown environment is crucial to solve the tasks. Here we introduce Prediction of Bootstrap Latents (PBL), a simple and flexible self-supervised representation learning algorithm for multitask deep RL. PBL builds on multistep predictive representations of future observations, and focuses on capturing structured information about environment dynamics. Specifically, PBL trains its representation by predicting latent embeddings of future observations. These latent embeddings are themselves trained to be predictive of the aforementioned representations. These predictions form a bootstrapping effect, allowing the agent to learn more about the key aspects of the environment dynamics. In addition, by defining prediction tasks completely in latent space, PBL provides the flexibility of using multimodal observations involving pixel images, language instructions, rewards and more. We show in our experiments that PBL delivers across-the-board improved performance over state of the art deep RL agents in the DMLab-30 and Atari-57 multitask setting.\n",
      "It is always demanding to learn robust visual representation for various learning problems; however, this learning and maintenance process usually suffers from noise, incompleteness or knowledge domain mismatch. Thus, robust representation learning by removing noisy features or samples, complementing incomplete data, and mitigating the distribution difference becomes the key. Along this line of research, low-rank modeling has been widely-applied to solving representation learning challenges. This survey covers the topic from a knowledge flow perspective in terms of: (1) robust knowledge recovery, (2) robust knowledge transfer, and (3) robust knowledge fusion, centered around several major applications. First of all, we deliver a unified formulation for robust knowledge discovery given single dataset. Second, we discuss robust knowledge transfer and fusion given multiple datasets with different knowledge flows, followed by practical challenges, model variations, and remarks. Finally, we highlight future research of robust knowledge discovery for incomplete, unbalance, large-scale data analysis. This would benefit AI community from literature review to future direction.\n",
      "In this work, we present a learning-based approach to chip placement, one of the most complex and time-consuming stages of the chip design process. Unlike prior methods, our approach has the ability to learn from past experience and improve over time. In particular, as we train over a greater number of chip blocks, our method becomes better at rapidly generating optimized placements for previously unseen chip blocks. To achieve these results, we pose placement as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem and train an agent to place the nodes of a chip netlist onto a chip canvas. To enable our RL policy to generalize to unseen blocks, we ground representation learning in the supervised task of predicting placement quality. By designing a neural architecture that can accurately predict reward across a wide variety of netlists and their placements, we are able to generate rich feature embeddings of the input netlists. We then use this architecture as the encoder of our policy and value networks to enable transfer learning. Our objective is to minimize PPA (power, performance, and area), and we show that, in under 6 hours, our method can generate placements that are superhuman or comparable on modern accelerator netlists, whereas existing baselines require human experts in the loop and take several weeks.\n",
      "We investigate the use of Minimax distances to extract in a nonparametric way the features that capture the unknown underlying patterns and structures in the data. We develop a general-purpose and computationally efficient framework to employ Minimax distances with many machine learning methods that perform on numerical data. We study both computing the pairwise Minimax distances for all pairs of objects and as well as computing the Minimax distances of all the objects to/from a fixed (test) object.   We first efficiently compute the pairwise Minimax distances between the objects, using the equivalence of Minimax distances over a graph and over a minimum spanning tree constructed on that. Then, we perform an embedding of the pairwise Minimax distances into a new vector space, such that their squared Euclidean distances in the new space equal to the pairwise Minimax distances in the original space. We also study the case of having multiple pairwise Minimax matrices, instead of a single one. Thereby, we propose an embedding via first summing up the centered matrices and then performing an eigenvalue decomposition to obtain the relevant features.   In the following, we study computing Minimax distances from a fixed (test) object which can be used for instance in K-nearest neighbor search. Similar to the case of all-pair pairwise Minimax distances, we develop an efficient and general-purpose algorithm that is applicable with any arbitrary base distance measure. Moreover, we investigate in detail the edges selected by the Minimax distances and thereby explore the ability of Minimax distances in detecting outlier objects.   Finally, for each setting, we perform several experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.\n",
      "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been successfully applied in several research domains such as robot navigation and automated video game playing. However, these methods require excessive computation and interaction with the environment, so enhancements on sample efficiency are required. The main reason for this requirement is that sparse and delayed rewards do not provide an effective supervision for representation learning of deep neural networks. In this study, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is augmented with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to increase the sample efficiency by enforcing the network to learn efficient representations without depending on sparse and delayed rewards as supervision. The results show that an increased performance can be obtained by jointly training a DRL agent with a GAN discriminator.   ----   Derin Pekistirmeli Ogrenme, robot navigasyonu ve otomatiklestirilmis video oyunu oynama gibi arastirma alanlarinda basariyla uygulanmaktadir.

      "Deep learning methods capable of handling relational data have proliferated over the last years. In contrast to traditional relational learning methods that leverage first-order logic for representing such data, these deep learning methods aim at re-representing symbolic relational data in Euclidean spaces. They offer better scalability, but can only numerically approximate relational structures and are less flexible in terms of reasoning tasks supported. This paper introduces a novel framework for relational representation learning that combines the best of both worlds. This framework, inspired by the auto-encoding principle, uses first-order logic as a data representation language, and the mapping between the original and latent representation is done by means of logic programs instead of neural networks. We show how learning can be cast as a constraint optimisation problem for which existing solvers can be used. The use of logic as a representation language makes the proposed framework more accurate (as the representation is exact, rather than approximate), more flexible, and more interpretable than deep learning methods. We experimentally show that these latent representations are indeed beneficial in relational learning tasks.\n",
      "Robustness is an increasingly important property of machine learning models as they become more and more prevalent. We propose a defense against adversarial examples based on a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) on the intermediate activation of neural networks. Our scheme surpasses state-of-the-art defenses on MNIST and CIFAR-10 against l2-perturbation by a significant margin. With our models, the mean perturbation norm required to fool our MNIST model is 3.07 and 2.30 on CIFAR-10. Additionally, we propose a simple certifiable lower bound on the l2-norm of the adversarial perturbation using a more specific version of our scheme, a 1-NN on representations learned by a Lipschitz network. Our model provides a nontrivial average lower bound of the perturbation norm, comparable to other schemes on MNIST with similar clean accuracy.\n",
      "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning require a large amount of training data and generally result in representations that are often over specialized to the target task. In this work, we present a methodology to study the underlying potential causes for this specialization. We use the recently proposed projection weighted Canonical Correlation Analysis (PWCCA) to measure the similarity of visual representations learned in the same environment by performing different tasks.   We then leverage our proposed methodology to examine the task dependence of visual representations learned on related but distinct embodied navigation tasks. Surprisingly, we find that slight differences in task have no measurable effect on the visual representation for both SqueezeNet and ResNet architectures. We then empirically demonstrate that visual representations learned on one task can be effectively transferred to a different task.\n",
      "Predictions and predictive knowledge have seen recent success in improving not only robot control but also other applications ranging from industrial process control to rehabilitation. A property that makes these predictive approaches well suited for robotics is that they can be learned online and incrementally through interaction with the environment. However, a remaining challenge for many prediction-learning approaches is an appropriate choice of prediction-learning parameters, especially parameters that control the magnitude of a learning machine's updates to its predictions (the learning rate or step size). To begin to address this challenge, we examine the use of online step-size adaptation using a sensor-rich robotic arm. Our method of choice, Temporal-Difference Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (TIDBD), learns and adapts step sizes on a feature level; importantly, TIDBD allows step-size tuning and representation learning to occur at the same time. We show that TIDBD is a practical alternative for classic Temporal-Difference (TD) learning via an extensive parameter search. Both approaches perform comparably in terms of predicting future aspects of a robotic data stream. Furthermore, the use of a step-size adaptation method like TIDBD appears to allow a system to automatically detect and characterize common sensor failures in a robotic application. Together, these results promise to improve the ability of robotic devices to learn from interactions with their environments in a robust way, providing key capabilities for autonomous agents and robots.\n",
      "A common strategy in modern learning systems is to learn a representation that is useful for many tasks, a.k.a. representation learning. We study this strategy in the imitation learning setting for Markov decision processes (MDPs) where multiple experts' trajectories are available. We formulate representation learning as a bi-level optimization problem where the \"outer\" optimization tries to learn the joint representation and the \"inner\" optimization encodes the imitation learning setup and tries to learn task-specific parameters. We instantiate this framework for the imitation learning settings of behavior cloning and observation-alone. Theoretically, we show using our framework that representation learning can provide sample complexity benefits for imitation learning in both settings. We also provide proof-of-concept experiments to verify our theory.\n",
      "We investigate the effect of the dimensionality of the representations learned in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on their robustness to input perturbations, both adversarial and random. To achieve low dimensionality of learned representations, we propose an easy-to-use, end-to-end trainable, low-rank regularizer (LR) that can be applied to any intermediate layer representation of a DNN. This regularizer forces the feature representations to (mostly) lie in a low-dimensional linear subspace. We perform a wide range of experiments that demonstrate that the LR indeed induces low rank on the representations, while providing modest improvements to accuracy as an added benefit. Furthermore, the learned features make the trained model significantly more robust to input perturbations such as Gaussian and adversarial noise (even without adversarial training). Lastly, the low-dimensionality means that the learned features are highly compressible; thus discriminative features of the data can be stored using very little memory. Our experiments indicate that models trained using the LR learn robust classifiers by discovering subspaces that avoid non-robust features. Algorithmically, the LR is scalable, generic, and straightforward to implement into existing deep learning frameworks.\n",
      "Unsupervised text encoding models have recently fueled substantial progress in NLP. The key idea is to use neural networks to convert words in texts to vector space representations based on word positions in a sentence and their contexts, which are suitable for end-to-end training of downstream tasks. We see a strikingly similar situation in spatial analysis, which focuses on incorporating both absolute positions and spatial contexts of geographic objects such as POIs into models. A general-purpose representation model for space is valuable for a multitude of tasks. However, no such general model exists to date beyond simply applying discretization or feed-forward nets to coordinates, and little effort has been put into jointly modeling distributions with vastly different characteristics, which commonly emerges from GIS data. Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning Neuroscience research shows that grid cells in mammals provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for location encoding and is critical for recognizing places and for path-integration. Therefore, we propose a representation learning model called Space2Vec to encode the absolute positions and spatial relationships of places. We conduct experiments on two real-world geographic data for two different tasks: 1) predicting types of POIs given their positions and context, 2) image classification leveraging their geo-locations. Results show that because of its multi-scale representations, Space2Vec outperforms well-established ML approaches such as RBF kernels, multi-layer feed-forward nets, and tile embedding approaches for location modeling and image classification tasks. Detailed analysis shows that all baselines can at most well handle distribution at one scale but show poor performances in other scales. In contrast, Space2Vec's multi-scale representation can handle distributions at different scales.\n",
      "Learning disentangled representations is considered a cornerstone problem in representation learning. Recently, Locatello et al. (2019) demonstrated that unsupervised disentanglement learning without inductive biases is theoretically impossible and that existing inductive biases and unsupervised methods do not allow to consistently learn disentangled representations. However, in many practical settings, one might have access to a limited amount of supervision, for example through manual labeling of (some) factors of variation in a few training examples. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such supervision on state-of-the-art disentanglement methods and perform a large scale study, training over 52000 models under well-defined and reproducible experimental conditions. We observe that a small number of labeled examples (0.01--0.5\\% of the data set), with potentially imprecise and incomplete labels, is sufficient to perform model selection on state-of-the-art unsupervised models. Further, we investigate the benefit of incorporating supervision into the training process. Overall, we empirically validate that with little and imprecise supervision it is possible to reliably learn disentangled representations.\n",
      "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become popular platforms for online learning. While MOOCs enable students to study at their own pace, this flexibility makes it easy for students to drop out of class. In this paper, our goal is to predict if a learner is going to drop out within the next week, given clickstream data for the current week. To this end, we present a multi-layer representation learning solution based on branch and bound (BB) algorithm, which learns from low-level clickstreams in an unsupervised manner, produces interpretable results, and avoids manual feature engineering. In experiments on Coursera data, we show that our model learns a representation that allows a simple model to perform similarly well to more complex, task-specific models, and how the BB algorithm enables interpretable results. In our analysis of the observed limitations, we discuss promising future directions.\n",
      "Recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the human brain represents information in a geometric structure (for instance, through conceptual spaces). In order to communicate, we flatten the complex representation of entities and their attributes into a single word or a sentence. In this paper we use graph convolutional networks to support the evolution of language and cooperation in multi-agent systems. Motivated by an image-based referential game, we propose a graph referential game with varying degrees of complexity, and we provide strong baseline models that exhibit desirable properties in terms of language emergence and cooperation. We show that the emerged communication protocol is robust, that the agents uncover the true factors of variation in the game, and that they learn to generalize beyond the samples encountered during training.\n",
      "The richness in the content of various information networks such as social networks and communication networks provides the unprecedented potential for learning high-quality expressive representations without external supervision. This paper investigates how to preserve and extract the abundant information from graph-structured data into embedding space in an unsupervised manner. To this end, we propose a novel concept, Graphical Mutual Information (GMI), to measure the correlation between input graphs and high-level hidden representations. GMI generalizes the idea of conventional mutual information computations from vector space to the graph domain where measuring mutual information from two aspects of node features and topological structure is indispensable. GMI exhibits several benefits: First, it is invariant to the isomorphic transformation of input graphs---an inevitable constraint in many existing graph representation learning algorithms; Besides, it can be efficiently estimated and maximized by current mutual information estimation methods such as MINE; Finally, our theoretical analysis confirms its correctness and rationality. With the aid of GMI, we develop an unsupervised learning model trained by maximizing GMI between the input and output of a graph neural encoder. Considerable experiments on transductive as well as inductive node classification and link prediction demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, and even sometimes exceeds the performance of supervised ones.\n",
      "We propose a novel deep learning method for local self-supervised representation learning that does not require labels nor end-to-end backpropagation but exploits the natural order in data instead. Inspired by the observation that biological neural networks appear to learn without backpropagating a global error signal, we split a deep neural network into a stack of gradient-isolated modules. Each module is trained to maximally preserve the information of its inputs using the InfoNCE bound from Oord et al. [2018]. Despite this greedy training, we demonstrate that each module improves upon the output of its predecessor, and that the representations created by the top module yield highly competitive results on downstream classification tasks in the audio and visual domain. The proposal enables optimizing modules asynchronously, allowing large-scale distributed training of very deep neural networks on unlabelled datasets.\n",
      "\"Deep Archetypal Analysis\" generates latent representations of high-dimensional datasets in terms of fractions of intuitively understandable basic entities called archetypes. The proposed method is an extension of linear \"Archetypal Analysis\" (AA), an unsupervised method to represent multivariate data points as sparse convex combinations of extremal elements of the dataset. Unlike the original formulation of AA, \"Deep AA\" can also handle side information and provides the ability for data-driven representation learning which reduces the dependence on expert knowledge. Our method is motivated by studies of evolutionary trade-offs in biology where archetypes are species highly adapted to a single task. Along these lines, we demonstrate that \"Deep AA\" also lends itself to the supervised exploration of chemical space, marking a distinct starting point for de novo molecular design. In the unsupervised setting we show how \"Deep AA\" is used on CelebA to identify archetypal faces. These can then be superimposed in order to generate new faces which inherit dominant traits of the archetypes they are based on.\n",
      "This paper studies learning the representations of whole graphs in both unsupervised and semi-supervised scenarios. Graph-level representations are critical in a variety of real-world applications such as predicting the properties of molecules and community analysis in social networks. Traditional graph kernel based methods are simple, yet effective for obtaining fixed-length representations for graphs but they suffer from poor generalization due to hand-crafted designs. There are also some recent methods based on language models (e.g. graph2vec) but they tend to only consider certain substructures (e.g. subtrees) as graph representatives. Inspired by recent progress of unsupervised representation learning, in this paper we proposed a novel method called InfoGraph for learning graph-level representations. We maximize the mutual information between the graph-level representation and the representations of substructures of different scales (e.g., nodes, edges, triangles). By doing so, the graph-level representations encode aspects of the data that are shared across different scales of substructures. Furthermore, we further propose InfoGraph*, an extension of InfoGraph for semi-supervised scenarios. InfoGraph* maximizes the mutual information between unsupervised graph representations learned by InfoGraph and the representations learned by existing supervised methods. As a result, the supervised encoder learns from unlabeled data while preserving the latent semantic space favored by the current supervised task. Experimental results on the tasks of graph classification and molecular property prediction show that InfoGraph is superior to state-of-the-art baselines and InfoGraph* can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art semi-supervised models.\n",
      "We present Spectral Inference Networks, a framework for learning eigenfunctions of linear operators by stochastic optimization. Spectral Inference Networks generalize Slow Feature Analysis to generic symmetric operators, and are closely related to Variational Monte Carlo methods from computational physics. As such, they can be a powerful tool for unsupervised representation learning from video or graph-structured data. We cast training Spectral Inference Networks as a bilevel optimization problem, which allows for online learning of multiple eigenfunctions. We show results of training Spectral Inference Networks on problems in quantum mechanics and feature learning for videos on synthetic datasets. Our results demonstrate that Spectral Inference Networks accurately recover eigenfunctions of linear operators and can discover interpretable representations from video in a fully unsupervised manner.\n",
      "In this paper we consider self-supervised representation learning to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL). We propose a forward prediction objective for simultaneously learning embeddings of states and action sequences. These embeddings capture the structure of the environment's dynamics, enabling efficient policy learning. We demonstrate that our action embeddings alone improve the sample efficiency and peak performance of model-free RL on control from low-dimensional states. By combining state and action embeddings, we achieve efficient learning of high-quality policies on goal-conditioned continuous control from pixel observations in only 1-2 million environment steps.\n",
      "A structured understanding of our world in terms of objects, relations, and hierarchies is an important component of human cognition. Learning such a structured world model from raw sensory data remains a challenge. As a step towards this goal, we introduce Contrastively-trained Structured World Models (C-SWMs). C-SWMs utilize a contrastive approach for representation learning in environments with compositional structure. We structure each state embedding as a set of object representations and their relations, modeled by a graph neural network. This allows objects to be discovered from raw pixel observations without direct supervision as part of the learning process. We evaluate C-SWMs on compositional environments involving multiple interacting objects that can be manipulated independently by an agent, simple Atari games, and a multi-object physics simulation. Our experiments demonstrate that C-SWMs can overcome limitations of models based on pixel reconstruction and outperform typical representatives of this model class in highly structured environments, while learning interpretable object-based representations.\n",
      "Acquiring ground truth labels for unlabelled data can be a costly procedure, since it often requires manual labour that is error-prone. Consequently, the available amount of labelled data is increasingly reduced due to the limitations of manual data labelling. It is possible to increase the amount of labelled data samples by performing automated labelling or crowd-sourcing the annotation procedure. However, they often introduce noise or uncertainty in the labelset, that leads to decreased performance of supervised deep learning methods. On the other hand, weak supervision methods remain robust during noisy labelsets or can be effective even with low amounts of labelled data. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of a representation learning method that uses external categorical evidence called \"Evidence Transfer\", against low amount of corresponding evidence termed as incomplete evidence. Evidence transfer is a robust solution against external unknown categorical evidence that can introduce noise or uncertainty. In our experimental evaluation, evidence transfer proves to be effective and robust against different levels of incompleteness, for two types of incomplete evidence.\n",
      "A new prior is proposed for learning representations of high-level concepts of the kind we manipulate with language. This prior can be combined with other priors in order to help disentangling abstract factors from each other. It is inspired by cognitive neuroscience theories of consciousness, seen as a bottleneck through which just a few elements, after having been selected by attention from a broader pool, are then broadcast and condition further processing, both in perception and decision-making. The set of recently selected elements one becomes aware of is seen as forming a low-dimensional conscious state. This conscious state is combining the few concepts constituting a conscious thought, i.e., what one is immediately conscious of at a particular moment. We claim that this architectural and information-processing constraint corresponds to assumptions about the joint distribution between high-level concepts. To the extent that these assumptions are generally true (and the form of natural language seems consistent with them), they can form a useful prior for representation learning. A low-dimensional thought or conscious state is analogous to a sentence: it involves only a few variables and yet can make a statement with very high probability of being true. This is consistent with a joint distribution (over high-level concepts) which has the form of a sparse factor graph, i.e., where the dependencies captured by each factor of the factor graph involve only very few variables while creating a strong dip in the overall energy function. The consciousness prior also makes it natural to map conscious states to natural language utterances or to express classical AI knowledge in a form similar to facts and rules, albeit capturing uncertainty as well as efficient search mechanisms implemented by attention mechanisms.\n",
      "Most previous studies on multi-agent reinforcement learning focus on deriving decentralized and cooperative policies to maximize a common reward and rarely consider the transferability of trained policies to new tasks. This prevents such policies from being applied to more complex multi-agent tasks. To resolve these limitations, we propose a model that conducts both representation learning for multiple agents using hierarchical graph attention network and policy learning using multi-agent actor-critic. The hierarchical graph attention network is specially designed to model the hierarchical relationships among multiple agents that either cooperate or compete with each other to derive more advanced strategic policies. Two attention networks, the inter-agent and inter-group attention layers, are used to effectively model individual and group level interactions, respectively. The two attention networks have been proven to facilitate the transfer of learned policies to new tasks with different agent compositions and allow one to interpret the learned strategies. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods in several mixed cooperative and competitive tasks.\n",
      "Most machine learning theory and practice is concerned with learning a single task. In this thesis it is argued that in general there is insufficient information in a single task for a learner to generalise well and that what is required for good generalisation is information about many similar learning tasks. Similar learning tasks form a body of prior information that can be used to constrain the learner and make it generalise better. Examples of learning scenarios in which there are many similar tasks are handwritten character recognition and spoken word recognition.   The concept of the environment of a learner is introduced as a probability measure over the set of learning problems the learner might be expected to learn. It is shown how a sample from the environment may be used to learn a representation, or recoding of the input space that is appropriate for the environment. Learning a representation can equivalently be thought of as learning the appropriate features of the environment. Bounds are derived on the sample size required to ensure good generalisation from a representation learning process. These bounds show that under certain circumstances learning a representation appropriate for $n$ tasks reduces the number of examples required of each task by a factor of $n$.   Once a representation is learnt it can be used to learn novel tasks from the same environment, with the result that far fewer examples are required of the new tasks to ensure good generalisation. Bounds are given on the number of tasks and the number of samples from each task required to ensure that a representation will be a good one for learning novel tasks.   The results on representation learning are generalised to cover any form of automated hypothesis space bias.\n",
      "We study the problem of learning permutation invariant representations that can capture \"flexible\" notions of containment. We formalize this problem via a measure theoretic definition of multisets, and obtain a theoretically-motivated learning model. We propose training this model on a novel task: predicting the size of the symmetric difference (or intersection) between pairs of multisets. We demonstrate that our model not only performs very well on predicting containment relations (and more effectively predicts the sizes of symmetric differences and intersections than DeepSets-based approaches with unconstrained object representations), but that it also learns meaningful representations.\n",
      "The information bottleneck principle is an elegant and useful approach to representation learning. In this paper, we investigate the problem of representation learning in the context of reinforcement learning using the information bottleneck framework, aiming at improving the sample efficiency of the learning algorithms. %by accelerating the process of discarding irrelevant information when the %input states are extremely high-dimensional. We analytically derive the optimal conditional distribution of the representation, and provide a variational lower bound. Then, we maximize this lower bound with the Stein variational (SV) gradient method. We incorporate this framework in the advantageous actor critic algorithm (A2C) and the proximal policy optimization algorithm (PPO). Our experimental results show that our framework can improve the sample efficiency of vanilla A2C and PPO significantly. Finally, we study the information bottleneck (IB) perspective in deep RL with the algorithm called mutual information neural estimation(MINE) . We experimentally verify that the information extraction-compression process also exists in deep RL and our framework is capable of accelerating this process. We also analyze the relationship between MINE and our method, through this relationship, we theoretically derive an algorithm to optimize our IB framework without constructing the lower bound.\n",
      "Machine learning on graph structured data has attracted much research interest due to its ubiquity in real world data. However, how to efficiently represent graph data in a general way is still an open problem. Traditional methods use handcraft graph features in a tabular form but suffer from the defects of domain expertise requirement and information loss. Graph representation learning overcomes these defects by automatically learning the continuous representations from graph structures, but they require abundant training labels, which are often hard to fulfill for graph-level prediction problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, if available, the domain expertise used for designing handcraft graph features can improve the graph-level representation learning when training labels are scarce. Specifically, we proposed a multi-task knowledge distillation method. By incorporating network-theory-based graph metrics as auxiliary tasks, we show on both synthetic and real datasets that the proposed multi-task learning method can improve the prediction performance of the original learning task, especially when the training data size is small.\n",
      "Continual learning aims to improve the ability of modern learning systems to deal with non-stationary distributions, typically by attempting to learn a series of tasks sequentially. Prior art in the field has largely considered supervised or reinforcement learning tasks, and often assumes full knowledge of task labels and boundaries. In this work, we propose an approach (CURL) to tackle a more general problem that we will refer to as unsupervised continual learning. The focus is on learning representations without any knowledge about task identity, and we explore scenarios when there are abrupt changes between tasks, smooth transitions from one task to another, or even when the data is shuffled. The proposed approach performs task inference directly within the model, is able to dynamically expand to capture new concepts over its lifetime, and incorporates additional rehearsal-based techniques to deal with catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate the efficacy of CURL in an unsupervised learning setting with MNIST and Omniglot, where the lack of labels ensures no information is leaked about the task. Further, we demonstrate strong performance compared to prior art in an i.i.d setting, or when adapting the technique to supervised tasks such as incremental class learning.\n",
      "A continual learning agent should be able to build on top of existing knowledge to learn on new data quickly while minimizing forgetting. Current intelligent systems based on neural network function approximators arguably do the opposite---they are highly prone to forgetting and rarely trained to facilitate future learning. One reason for this poor behavior is that they learn from a representation that is not explicitly trained for these two goals. In this paper, we propose OML, an objective that directly minimizes catastrophic interference by learning representations that accelerate future learning and are robust to forgetting under online updates in continual learning. We show that it is possible to learn naturally sparse representations that are more effective for online updating. Moreover, our algorithm is complementary to existing continual learning strategies, such as MER and GEM. Finally, we demonstrate that a basic online updating strategy on representations learned by OML is competitive with rehearsal based methods for continual learning. We release an implementation of our method at https://github.com/khurramjaved96/mrcl .\n",
      "Modern neural network training relies on piece-wise (sub-)differentiable functions in order to use backpropagation to update model parameters. In this work, we introduce a novel method to allow simple non-differentiable functions at intermediary layers of deep neural networks. We do so by training with a differentiable approximation bridge (DAB) neural network which approximates the non-differentiable forward function and provides gradient updates during backpropagation. We present strong empirical results (performing over 600 experiments) in four different domains: unsupervised (image) representation learning, variational (image) density estimation, image classification, and sequence sorting to demonstrate that our proposed method improves state of the art performance. We demonstrate that training with DAB aided discrete non-differentiable functions improves image reconstruction quality and posterior linear separability by 10% against the Gumbel-Softmax relaxed estimator [37, 26] as well as providing a 9% improvement in the test variational lower bound in comparison to the state of the art RELAX [16] discrete estimator. We also observe an accuracy improvement of 77% in neural sequence sorting and a 25% improvement against the straight-through estimator [5] in an image classification setting. The DAB network is not used for inference and expands the class of functions that are usable in neural networks.\n",
      "Distributed representations have been used to support downstream tasks in healthcare recently. Healthcare data (e.g., electronic health records) contain multiple modalities of data from heterogeneous sources that can provide complementary information, alongside an added dimension to learning personalized patient representations. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel unsupervised encoder-decoder model, namely Mixed Pooling Multi-View Attention Autoencoder (MPVAA), that generates patient representations encapsulating a holistic view of their medical profile. Specifically, by first learning personalized graph embeddings pertaining to each patient's heterogeneous healthcare data, it then integrates the non-linear relationships among them into a unified representation through multi-view attention mechanism. Additionally, a mixed pooling strategy is incorporated in the encoding step to learn diverse information specific to each data modality. Experiments conducted for multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art representation learning methods in healthcare.\n",
      "Effective modeling of electronic health records presents many challenges as they contain large amounts of irregularity most of which are due to the varying procedures and diagnosis a patient may have. Despite the recent progress in machine learning, unsupervised learning remains largely at open, especially in the healthcare domain. In this work, we present a two-step unsupervised representation learning scheme to summarize the multi-modal clinical time series consisting of signals and medical codes into a patient status vector. First, an auto-encoder step is used to reduce sparse medical codes and clinical time series into a distributed representation. Subsequently, the concatenation of the distributed representations is further fine-tuned using a forecasting task. We evaluate the usefulness of the representation on two downstream tasks: mortality and readmission. Our proposed method shows improved generalization performance for both short duration ICU visits and long duration ICU visits.\n",
      "Incompleteness is a common problem for existing knowledge graphs (KGs), and the completion of KG which aims to predict links between entities is challenging. Most existing KG completion methods only consider the direct relation between nodes and ignore the relation paths which contain useful information for link prediction. Recently, a few methods take relation paths into consideration but pay less attention to the order of relations in paths which is important for reasoning. In addition, these path-based models always ignore nonlinear contributions of path features for link prediction. To solve these problems, we propose a novel KG completion method named OPTransE. Instead of embedding both entities of a relation into the same latent space as in previous methods, we project the head entity and the tail entity of each relation into different spaces to guarantee the order of relations in the path. Meanwhile, we adopt a pooling strategy to extract nonlinear and complex features of different paths to further improve the performance of link prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed model OPTransE performs better than state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Efficient representation of patients is very important in the healthcare domain and can help with many tasks such as medical risk prediction. Many existing methods, such as diagnostic Cost Groups (DCG), rely on expert knowledge to build patient representation from medical data, which is resource consuming and non-scalable. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are a good choice for automating the representation learning process. However, there is very little research focusing on onpatient-level representation learning directly from medical claims. In this paper, weproposed a novel patient vector learning architecture that learns high quality,fixed-length patient representation from claims data. We conducted several experiments to test the quality of our learned representation, and the empirical results show that our learned patient vectors are superior to vectors learned through other methods including a popular commercial model. Lastly, we provide potential clinical interpretation for using our representation on predictive tasks, as interpretability is vital in the healthcare domain\n",
      "Self-supervised learning has become increasingly important to leverage the abundance of unlabeled data available on platforms like YouTube. Whereas most existing approaches learn low-level representations, we propose a joint visual-linguistic model to learn high-level features without any explicit supervision. In particular, inspired by its recent success in language modeling, we build upon the BERT model to learn bidirectional joint distributions over sequences of visual and linguistic tokens, derived from vector quantization of video data and off-the-shelf speech recognition outputs, respectively. We use VideoBERT in numerous tasks, including action classification and video captioning. We show that it can be applied directly to open-vocabulary classification, and confirm that large amounts of training data and cross-modal information are critical to performance. Furthermore, we outperform the state-of-the-art on video captioning, and quantitative results verify that the model learns high-level semantic features.\n",
      "To explore underlying complementary information from multiple views, in this paper, we propose a novel Latent Multi-view Semi-Supervised Classification (LMSSC) method. Unlike most existing multi-view semi-supervised classification methods that learn the graph using original features, our method seeks an underlying latent representation and performs graph learning and label propagation based on the learned latent representation. With the complementarity of multiple views, the latent representation could depict the data more comprehensively than every single view individually, accordingly making the graph more accurate and robust as well. Finally, LMSSC integrates latent representation learning, graph construction, and label propagation into a unified framework, which makes each subtask optimized. Experimental results on real-world benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n",
      "In representation learning and non-linear dimension reduction, there is a huge interest to learn the 'disentangled' latent variables, where each sub-coordinate almost uniquely controls a facet of the observed data. While many regularization approaches have been proposed on variational autoencoders, heuristic tuning is required to balance between disentanglement and loss in reconstruction accuracy -- due to the unsupervised nature, there is no principled way to find an optimal weight for regularization. Motivated to completely bypass regularization, we consider a projection strategy: modifying the canonical Gaussian encoder, we add a layer of scaling and rotation to the Gaussian mean, such that the marginal correlations among latent sub-coordinates become exactly zero. This achieves a theoretically maximal disentanglement, as guaranteed by zero cross-correlation between one latent sub-coordinate and the observed varying with the rest. Unlike regularizations, the extra projection layer does not impact the flexibility of the previous encoder layers, leading to almost no loss in expressiveness. This approach is simple to implement in practice. Our numerical experiments demonstrate very good performance, with no tuning required.\n",
      "Existing deep learning models may encounter great challenges in handling graph structured data. In this paper, we introduce a new deep learning model for graph data specifically, namely the deep loopy neural network. Significantly different from the previous deep models, inside the deep loopy neural network, there exist a large number of loops created by the extensive connections among nodes in the input graph data, which makes model learning an infeasible task. To resolve such a problem, in this paper, we will introduce a new learning algorithm for the deep loopy neural network specifically. Instead of learning the model variables based on the original model, in the proposed learning algorithm, errors will be back-propagated through the edges in a group of extracted spanning trees. Extensive numerical experiments have been done on several real-world graph datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed model and the learning algorithm in handling graph data.\n",
      "Using touch devices to navigate in virtual 3D environments such as computer assisted design (CAD) models or geographical information systems (GIS) is inherently difficult for humans, as the 3D operations have to be performed by the user on a 2D touch surface. This ill-posed problem is classically solved with a fixed and handcrafted interaction protocol, which must be learned by the user. We propose to automatically learn a new interaction protocol allowing to map a 2D user input to 3D actions in virtual environments using reinforcement learning (RL). A fundamental problem of RL methods is the vast amount of interactions often required, which are difficult to come by when humans are involved. To overcome this limitation, we make use of two collaborative agents. The first agent models the human by learning to perform the 2D finger trajectories. The second agent acts as the interaction protocol, interpreting and translating to 3D operations the 2D finger trajectories from the first agent. We restrict the learned 2D trajectories to be similar to a training set of collected human gestures by first performing state representation learning, prior to reinforcement learning. This state representation learning is addressed by projecting the gestures into a latent space learned by a variational auto encoder (VAE).\n",
      "Generative models for 3D geometric data arise in many important applications in 3D computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we focus on 3D deformable shapes that share a common topological structure, such as human faces and bodies. Morphable Models and their variants, despite their linear formulation, have been widely used for shape representation, while most of the recently proposed nonlinear approaches resort to intermediate representations, such as 3D voxel grids or 2D views. In this work, we introduce a novel graph convolutional operator, acting directly on the 3D mesh, that explicitly models the inductive bias of the fixed underlying graph. This is achieved by enforcing consistent local orderings of the vertices of the graph, through the spiral operator, thus breaking the permutation invariance property that is adopted by all the prior work on Graph Neural Networks. Our operator comes by construction with desirable properties (anisotropic, topology-aware, lightweight, easy-to-optimise), and by using it as a building block for traditional deep generative architectures, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on a variety of 3D shape datasets compared to the linear Morphable Model and other graph convolutional operators.\n",
      "Representation learning methods that transform encoded data (e.g., diagnosis and drug codes) into continuous vector spaces (i.e., vector embeddings) are critical for the application of deep learning in healthcare. Initial work in this area explored the use of variants of the word2vec algorithm to learn embeddings for medical concepts from electronic health records or medical claims datasets. We propose learning embeddings for medical concepts by using graph-based representation learning methods on SNOMED-CT, a widely popular knowledge graph in the healthcare domain with numerous operational and research applications. Current work presents an empirical analysis of various embedding methods, including the evaluation of their performance on multiple tasks of biomedical relevance (node classification, link prediction, and patient state prediction). Our results show that concept embeddings derived from the SNOMED-CT knowledge graph significantly outperform state-of-the-art embeddings, showing 5-6x improvement in ``concept similarity\" and 6-20\\% improvement in patient diagnosis.\n",
      "In multi-task reinforcement learning there are two main challenges: at training time, the ability to learn different policies with a single model; at test time, inferring which of those policies applying without an external signal. In the case of continual reinforcement learning a third challenge arises: learning tasks sequentially without forgetting the previous ones. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing DisCoRL, an approach combining state representation learning and policy distillation. We experiment on a sequence of three simulated 2D navigation tasks with a 3 wheel omni-directional robot. Moreover, we tested our approach's robustness by transferring the final policy into a real life setting. The policy can solve all tasks and automatically infer which one to run.\n",
      "We propose a new perspective on representation learning in reinforcement learning based on geometric properties of the space of value functions. We leverage this perspective to provide formal evidence regarding the usefulness of value functions as auxiliary tasks. Our formulation considers adapting the representation to minimize the (linear) approximation of the value function of all stationary policies for a given environment. We show that this optimization reduces to making accurate predictions regarding a special class of value functions which we call adversarial value functions (AVFs). We demonstrate that using value functions as auxiliary tasks corresponds to an expected-error relaxation of our formulation, with AVFs a natural candidate, and identify a close relationship with proto-value functions (Mahadevan, 2005). We highlight characteristics of AVFs and their usefulness as auxiliary tasks in a series of experiments on the four-room domain.\n",
      "End-to-end reinforcement learning agents learn a state representation and a policy at the same time. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been trained successfully as reinforcement learning agents in settings like dialogue that require structured prediction. In this paper, we investigate the representations learned by RNN-based agents when trained with both policy gradient and value-based methods. We show through extensive experiments and analysis that, when trained with policy gradient, recurrent neural networks often fail to learn a state representation that leads to an optimal policy in settings where the same action should be taken at different states. To explain this failure, we highlight the problem of state aliasing, which entails conflating two or more distinct states in the representation space. We demonstrate that state aliasing occurs when several states share the same optimal action and the agent is trained via policy gradient. We characterize this phenomenon through experiments on a simple maze setting and a more complex text-based game, and make recommendations for training RNNs with reinforcement learning.\n",
      "The automatic and efficient discovery of skills, without supervision, for long-living autonomous agents, remains a challenge of Artificial Intelligence. Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes give learning agents a human-inspired mechanism to sequentially select goals to achieve. This approach gives a new perspective on the lifelong learning problem, with promising results on both simulated and real-world experiments. Until recently, those algorithms were restricted to domains with experimenter-knowledge, since the Goal Space used by the agents was built on engineered feature extractors. The recent advances of deep representation learning, enables new ways of designing those feature extractors, using directly the agent experience. Recent work has shown the potential of those methods on simple yet challenging simulated domains. In this paper, we present recent results showing the applicability of those principles on a real-world robotic setup, where a 6-joint robotic arm learns to manipulate a ball inside an arena, by choosing goals in a space learned from its past experience.\n",
      "To be successful in real-world tasks, Reinforcement Learning (RL) needs to exploit the compositional, relational, and hierarchical structure of the world, and learn to transfer it to the task at hand. Recent advances in representation learning for language make it possible to build models that acquire world knowledge from text corpora and integrate this knowledge into downstream decision making problems. We thus argue that the time is right to investigate a tight integration of natural language understanding into RL in particular. We survey the state of the field, including work on instruction following, text games, and learning from textual domain knowledge. Finally, we call for the development of new environments as well as further investigation into the potential uses of recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for such tasks.\n",
      "The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is a popular platform for evaluating reinforcement learning agents. Much of the appeal comes from the fact that Atari games demonstrate aspects of competency we expect from an intelligent agent and are not biased toward any particular solution approach. The challenge of the ALE includes (1) the representation learning problem of extracting pertinent information from raw pixels, and (2) the behavioural learning problem of leveraging complex, delayed associations between actions and rewards. Often, the research questions we are interested in pertain more to the latter, but the representation learning problem adds significant computational expense. We introduce MinAtar, short for miniature Atari, a new set of environments that capture the general mechanics of specific Atari games while simplifying the representational complexity to focus more on the behavioural challenges. MinAtar consists of analogues of five Atari games: Seaquest, Breakout, Asterix, Freeway and Space Invaders. Each MinAtar environment provides the agent with a 10x10xn binary state representation. Each game plays out on a 10x10 grid with n channels corresponding to game-specific objects, such as ball, paddle and brick in the game Breakout. To investigate the behavioural challenges posed by MinAtar, we evaluated a smaller version of the DQN architecture as well as online actor-critic with eligibility traces. With the representation learning problem simplified, we can perform experiments with significantly less computational expense. In our experiments, we use the saved compute time to perform step-size parameter sweeps and more runs than is typical for the ALE. Experiments like this improve reproducibility, and allow us to draw more confident conclusions. We hope that MinAtar can allow researchers to thoroughly investigate behavioural challenges similar to those inherent in the ALE.\n",
      "We consider the problem of learning representations that achieve group and subgroup fairness with respect to multiple sensitive attributes. Taking inspiration from the disentangled representation learning literature, we propose an algorithm for learning compact representations of datasets that are useful for reconstruction and prediction, but are also \\emph{flexibly fair}, meaning they can be easily modified at test time to achieve subgroup demographic parity with respect to multiple sensitive attributes and their conjunctions. We show empirically that the resulting encoder---which does not require the sensitive attributes for inference---enables the adaptation of a single representation to a variety of fair classification tasks with new target labels and subgroup definitions.\n",
      "Self-supervised learning aims to learn representations from the data itself without explicit manual supervision. Existing efforts ignore a crucial aspect of self-supervised learning - the ability to scale to large amount of data because self-supervision requires no manual labels. In this work, we revisit this principle and scale two popular self-supervised approaches to 100 million images. We show that by scaling on various axes (including data size and problem 'hardness'), one can largely match or even exceed the performance of supervised pre-training on a variety of tasks such as object detection, surface normal estimation (3D) and visual navigation using reinforcement learning. Scaling these methods also provides many interesting insights into the limitations of current self-supervised techniques and evaluations. We conclude that current self-supervised methods are not 'hard' enough to take full advantage of large scale data and do not seem to learn effective high level semantic representations. We also introduce an extensive benchmark across 9 different datasets and tasks. We believe that such a benchmark along with comparable evaluation settings is necessary to make meaningful progress. Code is at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fair_self_supervision_benchmark.\n",
      "This paper investigates the resilience and robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies to adversarial perturbations in the state space. We first present an approach for the disentanglement of vulnerabilities caused by representation learning of DRL agents from those that stem from the sensitivity of the DRL policies to distributional shifts in state transitions. Building on this approach, we propose two RL-based techniques for quantitative benchmarking of adversarial resilience and robustness in DRL policies against perturbations of state transitions. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposals through experimental evaluation of resilience and robustness in DQN, A2C, and PPO2 policies trained in the Cartpole environment.\n",
      "Due to the ability of deep neural nets to learn rich representations, recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have focused on learning domain-invariant features that achieve a small error on the source domain. The hope is that the learnt representation, together with the hypothesis learnt from the source domain, can generalize to the target domain. In this paper, we first construct a simple counterexample showing that, contrary to common belief, the above conditions are not sufficient to guarantee successful domain adaptation. In particular, the counterexample exhibits \\emph{conditional shift}: the class-conditional distributions of input features change between source and target domains. To give a sufficient condition for domain adaptation, we propose a natural and interpretable generalization upper bound that explicitly takes into account the aforementioned shift. Moreover, we shed new light on the problem by proving an information-theoretic lower bound on the joint error of \\emph{any} domain adaptation method that attempts to learn invariant representations. Our result characterizes a fundamental tradeoff between learning invariant representations and achieving small joint error on both domains when the marginal label distributions differ from source to target. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets that corroborate our theoretical findings. We believe these insights are helpful in guiding the future design of domain adaptation and representation learning algorithms.\n",
      "A significant issue in training deep neural networks to solve supervised learning tasks is the need for large numbers of labelled datapoints. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to leverage ubiquitous unlabelled data, together with small quantities of labelled data, to achieve high task performance. Though substantial recent progress has been made in developing semi-supervised algorithms that are effective for comparatively small datasets, many of these techniques do not scale readily to the large (unlaballed) datasets characteristic of real-world applications. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to scalable semi-supervised learning, called Local Label Propagation (LLP). Extending ideas from recent work on unsupervised embedding learning, LLP first embeds datapoints, labelled and otherwise, in a common latent space using a deep neural network. It then propagates pseudolabels from known to unknown datapoints in a manner that depends on the local geometry of the embedding, taking into account both inter-point distance and local data density as a weighting on propagation likelihood. The parameters of the deep embedding are then trained to simultaneously maximize pseudolabel categorization performance as well as a metric of the clustering of datapoints within each psuedo-label group, iteratively alternating stages of network training and label propagation. We illustrate the utility of the LLP method on the ImageNet dataset, achieving results that outperform previous state-of-the-art scalable semi-supervised learning algorithms by large margins, consistently across a wide variety of training regimes. We also show that the feature representation learned with LLP transfers well to scene recognition in the Places 205 dataset.\n",
      "Unsupervised exploration and representation learning become increasingly important when learning in diverse and sparse environments. The information-theoretic principle of empowerment formalizes an unsupervised exploration objective through an agent trying to maximize its influence on the future states of its environment. Previous approaches carry certain limitations in that they either do not employ closed-loop feedback or do not have an internal state. As a consequence, a privileged final state is taken as an influence measure, rather than the full trajectory. We provide a model-free method which takes into account the whole trajectory while still offering the benefits of option-based approaches. We successfully apply our approach to settings with large action spaces, where discovery of meaningful action sequences is particularly difficult.\n",
      "Representations learnt through deep neural networks tend to be highly informative, but opaque in terms of what information they learn to encode. We introduce an approach to probabilistic modelling that learns to represent data with two separate deep representations: an invariant representation that encodes the information of the class from which the data belongs, and an equivariant representation that encodes the symmetry transformation defining the particular data point within the class manifold (equivariant in the sense that the representation varies naturally with symmetry transformations). This approach is based primarily on the strategic routing of data through the two latent variables, and thus is conceptually transparent, easy to implement, and in-principle generally applicable to any data comprised of discrete classes of continuous distributions (e.g. objects in images, topics in language, individuals in behavioural data). We demonstrate qualitatively compelling representation learning and competitive quantitative performance, in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, versus comparable modelling approaches in the literature with little fine tuning.\n",
      "Multiple clustering aims at exploring alternative clusterings to organize the data into meaningful groups from different perspectives. Existing multiple clustering algorithms are designed for single-view data. We assume that the individuality and commonality of multi-view data can be leveraged to generate high-quality and diverse clusterings. To this end, we propose a novel multi-view multiple clustering (MVMC) algorithm. MVMC first adapts multi-view self-representation learning to explore the individuality encoding matrices and the shared commonality matrix of multi-view data. It additionally reduces the redundancy (i.e., enhancing the individuality) among the matrices using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), and collects shared information by forcing the shared matrix to be smooth across all views. It then uses matrix factorization on the individual matrices, along with the shared matrix, to generate diverse clusterings of high-quality. We further extend multiple co-clustering on multi-view data and propose a solution called multi-view multiple co-clustering (MVMCC). Our empirical study shows that MVMC (MVMCC) can exploit multi-view data to generate multiple high-quality and diverse clusterings (co-clusterings), with superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Learning an effective representation for high-dimensional data is a challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) such as Deep Q networks (DQN) achieves remarkable success in computer games by learning deeply encoded representation from convolution networks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet very effective method for representation learning with DRL algorithms. Our key insight is that features learned by DRL algorithms are highly correlated, which interferes with learning. By adding a regularized loss that penalizes correlation in latent features (with only slight computation), we decorrelate features represented by deep neural networks incrementally. On 49 Atari games, with the same regularization factor, our decorrelation algorithms perform $70\\%$ in terms of human-normalized scores, which is $40\\%$ better than DQN. In particular, ours performs better than DQN on 39 games with 4 close ties and lost only slightly on $6$ games. Empirical results also show that the decorrelation method applies to Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN) and significantly boosts performance. Further experiments on the losing games show that our decorelation algorithms can win over DQN and QR-DQN with a fined tuned regularization factor.\n",

We then apply NDF on a multi-task coordinate regression problem and demonstrate the distribution of routing probabilities, which is vital for interpreting NDF yet not shown for regression problems.

      "In recent years, there have been numerous developments towards solving multimodal tasks, aiming to learn a stronger representation than through a single modality. Certain aspects of the data can be particularly useful in this case - for example, correlations in the space or time domain across modalities - but should be wisely exploited in order to benefit from their full predictive potential. We propose two deep learning architectures with multimodal cross-connections that allow for dataflow between several feature extractors (XFlow). Our models derive more interpretable features and achieve better performances than models which do not exchange representations, usefully exploiting correlations between audio and visual data, which have a different dimensionality and are nontrivially exchangeable. Our work improves on existing multimodal deep learning algorithms in two essential ways: (1) it presents a novel method for performing cross-modality (before features are learned from individual modalities) and (2) extends the previously proposed cross-connections which only transfer information between streams that process compatible data. Illustrating some of the representations learned by the connections, we analyse their contribution to the increase in discrimination ability and reveal their compatibility with a lip-reading network intermediate representation. We provide the research community with Digits, a new dataset consisting of three data types extracted from videos of people saying the digits 0-9. Results show that both cross-modal architectures outperform their baselines (by up to 11.5%) when evaluated on the AVletters, CUAVE and Digits datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.\n",
      "The goal of knowledge representation learning is to embed entities and relations into a low-dimensional, continuous vector space. How to push a model to its limit and obtain better results is of great significance in knowledge graph's applications. We propose a simple and elegant method, Trans-DLR, whose main idea is dynamic learning rate control during training. Our method achieves remarkable improvement, compared with recent GAN-based method. Moreover, we introduce a new negative sampling trick which corrupts not only entities, but also relations, in different probabilities. We also develop an efficient way, which fully utilizes multiprocessing and parallel computing, to speed up evaluation of the model in link prediction tasks. Experiments show that our method is effective.\n",
      "Recent advances in deep generative models have lead to remarkable progress in synthesizing high quality images. Following their successful application in image processing and representation learning, an important next step is to consider videos. Learning generative models of video is a much harder task, requiring a model to capture the temporal dynamics of a scene, in addition to the visual presentation of objects. While recent attempts at formulating generative models of video have had some success, current progress is hampered by (1) the lack of qualitative metrics that consider visual quality, temporal coherence, and diversity of samples, and (2) the wide gap between purely synthetic video data sets and challenging real-world data sets in terms of complexity. To this extent we propose Fr\\'{e}chet Video Distance (FVD), a new metric for generative models of video, and StarCraft 2 Videos (SCV), a benchmark of game play from custom starcraft 2 scenarios that challenge the current capabilities of generative models of video. We contribute a large-scale human study, which confirms that FVD correlates well with qualitative human judgment of generated videos, and provide initial benchmark results on SCV.\n",
      "Predicting human perceptual similarity is a challenging subject of ongoing research. The visual process underlying this aspect of human vision is thought to employ multiple different levels of visual analysis (shapes, objects, texture, layout, color, etc). In this paper, we postulate that the perception of image similarity is not an explicitly learned capability, but rather one that is a byproduct of learning others. This claim is supported by leveraging representations learned from a diverse set of visual tasks and using them jointly to predict perceptual similarity. This is done via simple feature concatenation, without any further learning. Nevertheless, experiments performed on the challenging Totally-Looks-Like (TLL) benchmark significantly surpass recent baselines, closing much of the reported gap towards prediction of human perceptual similarity. We provide an analysis of these results and discuss them in a broader context of emergent visual capabilities and their implications on the course of machine-vision research.\n",
      "We introduce The House Of inteRactions (THOR), a framework for visual AI research, available at http://ai2thor.allenai.org. AI2-THOR consists of near photo-realistic 3D indoor scenes, where AI agents can navigate in the scenes and interact with objects to perform tasks. AI2-THOR enables research in many different domains including but not limited to deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, learning by interaction, planning, visual question answering, unsupervised representation learning, object detection and segmentation, and learning models of cognition. The goal of AI2-THOR is to facilitate building visually intelligent models and push the research forward in this domain.\n",
      "There is a long history of using meta learning as representation learning, specifically for determining the relevance of inputs. In this paper, we examine an instance of meta-learning in which feature relevance is learned by adapting step size parameters of stochastic gradient descent---building on a variety of prior work in stochastic approximation, machine learning, and artificial neural networks. In particular, we focus on stochastic meta-descent introduced in the Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (IDBD) algorithm for setting individual step sizes for each feature of a linear function approximator. Using IDBD, a feature with large or small step sizes will have a large or small impact on generalization from training examples. As a main contribution of this work, we extend IDBD to temporal-difference (TD) learning---a form of learning which is effective in sequential, non i.i.d. problems. We derive a variety of IDBD generalizations for TD learning, demonstrating that they are able to distinguish which features are relevant and which are not. We demonstrate that TD IDBD is effective at learning feature relevance in both an idealized gridworld and a real-world robotic prediction task.\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel measure-theoretic theory for machine learning that does not require statistical assumptions. Based on this theory, a new regularization method in deep learning is derived and shown to outperform previous methods in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. Moreover, the proposed theory provides a theoretical basis for a family of practically successful regularization methods in deep learning. We discuss several consequences of our results on one-shot learning, representation learning, deep learning, and curriculum learning. Unlike statistical learning theory, the proposed learning theory analyzes each problem instance individually via measure theory, rather than a set of problem instances via statistics. As a result, it provides different types of results and insights when compared to statistical learning theory.\n",
      "Large amounts of labeled data are typically required to train deep learning models. For many real-world problems, however, acquiring additional data can be expensive or even impossible. We present semi-supervised deep kernel learning (SSDKL), a semi-supervised regression model based on minimizing predictive variance in the posterior regularization framework. SSDKL combines the hierarchical representation learning of neural networks with the probabilistic modeling capabilities of Gaussian processes. By leveraging unlabeled data, we show improvements on a diverse set of real-world regression tasks over supervised deep kernel learning and semi-supervised methods such as VAT and mean teacher adapted for regression.\n",
      "An increasing number of datasets contain multiple views, such as video, sound and automatic captions. A basic challenge in representation learning is how to leverage multiple views to learn better representations. This is further complicated by the existence of a latent alignment between views, such as between speech and its transcription, and by the multitude of choices for the learning objective. We explore an advanced, correlation-based representation learning method on a 4-way parallel, multimodal dataset, and assess the quality of the learned representations on retrieval-based tasks. We show that the proposed approach produces rich representations that capture most of the information shared across views. Our best models for speech and textual modalities achieve retrieval rates from 70.7% to 96.9% on open-domain, user-generated instructional videos. This shows it is possible to learn reliable representations across disparate, unaligned and noisy modalities, and encourages using the proposed approach on larger datasets.\n",
      "Recent empirical works have successfully used unlabeled data to learn feature representations that are broadly useful in downstream classification tasks. Several of these methods are reminiscent of the well-known word2vec embedding algorithm: leveraging availability of pairs of semantically \"similar\" data points and \"negative samples,\" the learner forces the inner product of representations of similar pairs with each other to be higher on average than with negative samples. The current paper uses the term contrastive learning for such algorithms and presents a theoretical framework for analyzing them by introducing latent classes and hypothesizing that semantically similar points are sampled from the same latent class. This framework allows us to show provable guarantees on the performance of the learned representations on the average classification task that is comprised of a subset of the same set of latent classes. Our generalization bound also shows that learned representations can reduce (labeled) sample complexity on downstream tasks. We conduct controlled experiments in both the text and image domains to support the theory.\n",
      "Neural networks designed for the task of classification have become a commodity in recent years. Many works target the development of more effective networks, which results in a complexification of their architectures with more layers, multiple sub-networks, or even the combination of multiple classifiers, but this often comes at the expense of producing uninterpretable black boxes. In this paper, we redesign a simple capsule network to enable it to synthesize class-representative samples, called prototypes, by replacing the last layer with a novel Hit-or-Miss layer. This layer contains activated vectors, called capsules, that we train to hit or miss a fixed target capsule by tailoring a specific centripetal loss function. This possibility allows to develop a data augmentation step combining information from the data space and the feature space, resulting in a hybrid data augmentation process. We show that our network, named HitNet, is able to reach better performances than those reproduced with the initial CapsNet on several datasets, while allowing to visualize the nature of the features extracted as deformations of the prototypes, which provides a direct insight into the feature representation learned by the network .\n",
      "Representation learning is a central challenge across a range of machine learning areas. In reinforcement learning, effective and functional representations have the potential to tremendously accelerate learning progress and solve more challenging problems. Most prior work on representation learning has focused on generative approaches, learning representations that capture all underlying factors of variation in the observation space in a more disentangled or well-ordered manner. In this paper, we instead aim to learn functionally salient representations: representations that are not necessarily complete in terms of capturing all factors of variation in the observation space, but rather aim to capture those factors of variation that are important for decision making -- that are \"actionable.\" These representations are aware of the dynamics of the environment, and capture only the elements of the observation that are necessary for decision making rather than all factors of variation, without explicit reconstruction of the observation. We show how these representations can be useful to improve exploration for sparse reward problems, to enable long horizon hierarchical reinforcement learning, and as a state representation for learning policies for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on a number of simulated environments, and compare it to prior methods for representation learning, exploration, and hierarchical reinforcement learning.\n",
      "Representation learning becomes especially important for complex systems with multimodal data sources such as cameras or sensors. Recent advances in reinforcement learning and optimal control make it possible to design control algorithms on these latent representations, but the field still lacks a large-scale standard dataset for unified comparison. In this work, we present a large-scale dataset and evaluation framework for representation learning for the complex task of landing an airplane. We implement and compare several approaches to representation learning on this dataset in terms of the quality of simple supervised learning tasks and disentanglement scores. The resulting representations can be used for further tasks such as anomaly detection, optimal control, model-based reinforcement learning, and other applications.\n",
      "The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular model for density estimation and representation learning. Canonically, the variational principle suggests to prefer an expressive inference model so that the variational approximation is accurate. However, it is often overlooked that an overly-expressive inference model can be detrimental to the test set performance of both the amortized posterior approximator and, more importantly, the generative density estimator. In this paper, we leverage the fact that VAEs rely on amortized inference and propose techniques for amortized inference regularization (AIR) that control the smoothness of the inference model. We demonstrate that, by applying AIR, it is possible to improve VAE generalization on both inference and generative performance. Our paper challenges the belief that amortized inference is simply a mechanism for approximating maximum likelihood training and illustrates that regularization of the amortization family provides a new direction for understanding and improving generalization in VAEs.\n",
      "Transfer learning can address the learning tasks of unlabeled data in the target domain by leveraging plenty of labeled data from a different but related source domain. A core issue in transfer learning is to learn a shared feature space in where the distributions of the data from two domains are matched. This learning process can be named as transfer representation learning (TRL). The feature transformation methods are crucial to ensure the success of TRL. The most commonly used feature transformation method in TRL is kernel-based nonlinear mapping to the high-dimensional space followed by linear dimensionality reduction. But the kernel functions are lack of interpretability and are difficult to be selected. To this end, the TSK fuzzy system (TSK-FS) is combined with transfer learning and a more intuitive and interpretable modeling method, called transfer representation learning with TSK-FS (TRL-TSK-FS) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, TRL-TSK-FS realizes TRL from two aspects. On one hand, the data in the source and target domains are transformed into the fuzzy feature space in which the distribution distance of the data between two domains is min-imized. On the other hand, discriminant information and geo-metric properties of the data are preserved by linear discriminant analysis and principal component analysis. In addition, another advantage arises with the proposed method, that is, the nonlinear transformation is realized by constructing fuzzy mapping with the antecedent part of the TSK-FS instead of kernel functions which are difficult to be selected. Extensive experiments are conducted on the text and image datasets. The results obviously show the superiority of the proposed method.\n",
      "The standard loss function used to train neural network classifiers, categorical cross-entropy (CCE), seeks to maximize accuracy on the training data; building useful representations is not a necessary byproduct of this objective. In this work, we propose clustering-oriented representation learning (COREL) as an alternative to CCE in the context of a generalized attractive-repulsive loss framework. COREL has the consequence of building latent representations that collectively exhibit the quality of natural clustering within the latent space of the final hidden layer, according to a predefined similarity function. Despite being simple to implement, COREL variants outperform or perform equivalently to CCE in a variety of scenarios, including image and news article classification using both feed-forward and convolutional neural networks. Analysis of the latent spaces created with different similarity functions facilitates insights on the different use cases COREL variants can satisfy, where the Cosine-COREL variant makes a consistently clusterable latent space, while Gaussian-COREL consistently obtains better classification accuracy than CCE.\n",
      "In this paper we introduce evidence transfer for clustering, a deep learning method that can incrementally manipulate the latent representations of an autoencoder, according to external categorical evidence, in order to improve a clustering outcome. By evidence transfer we define the process by which the categorical outcome of an external, auxiliary task is exploited to improve a primary task, in this case representation learning for clustering. Our proposed method makes no assumptions regarding the categorical evidence presented, nor the structure of the latent space. We compare our method, against the baseline solution by performing k-means clustering before and after its deployment. Experiments with three different kinds of evidence show that our method effectively manipulates the latent representations when introduced with real corresponding evidence, while remaining robust when presented with low quality evidence.\n",
      "Deep reinforcement-learning methods have achieved remarkable performance on challenging control tasks. Observations of the resulting behavior give the impression that the agent has constructed a generalized representation that supports insightful action decisions. We re-examine what is meant by generalization in RL, and propose several definitions based on an agent's performance in on-policy, off-policy, and unreachable states. We propose a set of practical methods for evaluating agents with these definitions of generalization. We demonstrate these techniques on a common benchmark task for deep RL, and we show that the learned networks make poor decisions for states that differ only slightly from on-policy states, even though those states are not selected adversarially. Taken together, these results call into question the extent to which deep Q-networks learn generalized representations, and suggest that more experimentation and analysis is necessary before claims of representation learning can be supported.\n",
      "Timely prediction of clinically critical events in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is important for improving care and survival rate. Most of the existing approaches are based on the application of various classification methods on explicitly extracted statistical features from vital signals. In this work, we propose to eliminate the high cost of engineering hand-crafted features from multivariate time-series of physiologic signals by learning their representation with a sequence-to-sequence auto-encoder. We then propose to hash the learned representations to enable signal similarity assessment for the prediction of critical events. We apply this methodological framework to predict Acute Hypotensive Episodes (AHE) on a large and diverse dataset of vital signal recordings. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the presented framework in accurately predicting an upcoming AHE.\n",
      "We propose Deep Hierarchical Machine (DHM), a model inspired from the divide-and-conquer strategy while emphasizing representation learning ability and flexibility. A stochastic routing framework as used by recent deep neural decision/regression forests is incorporated, but we remove the need to evaluate unnecessary computation paths by utilizing a different topology and introducing a probabilistic pruning technique. We also show a specified version of DHM (DSHM) for efficiency, which inherits the sparse feature extraction process as in traditional decision tree with pixel-difference feature. To achieve sparse feature extraction, we propose to utilize sparse convolution operation in DSHM and show one possibility of introducing sparse convolution kernels by using local binary convolution layer. DHM can be applied to both classification and regression problems, and we validate it on standard image classification and face alignment tasks to show its advantages over past architectures.\n",
      "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn effective features, though have been shown to suffer from a performance drop when the distribution of the data changes from training to test data. In this paper we analyze the internal representations of CNNs and observe that the representations of unseen data in each class, spread more (with higher variance) in the embedding space of the CNN compared to representations of the training data. More importantly, this difference is more extreme if the unseen data comes from a shifted distribution. Based on this observation, we objectively evaluate the degree of representation's variance in each class via eigenvalue decomposition on the within-class covariance of the internal representations of CNNs and observe the same behaviour. This can be problematic as larger variances might lead to mis-classification if the sample crosses the decision boundary of its class. We apply nearest neighbor classification on the representations and empirically show that the embeddings with the high variance actually have significantly worse KNN classification performances, although this could not be foreseen from their end-to-end classification results. To tackle this problem, we propose Deep Within-Class Covariance Analysis (DWCCA), a deep neural network layer that significantly reduces the within-class covariance of a DNN's representation, improving performance on unseen test data from a shifted distribution. We empirically evaluate DWCCA on two datasets for Acoustic Scene Classification (DCASE2016 and DCASE2017). We demonstrate that not only does DWCCA significantly improve the network's internal representation, it also increases the end-to-end classification accuracy, especially when the test set exhibits a distribution shift. By adding DWCCA to a VGG network, we achieve around 6 percentage points improvement in the case of a distribution mismatch.\n",
      "Increasing numbers of software vulnerabilities are discovered every year whether they are reported publicly or discovered internally in proprietary code. These vulnerabilities can pose serious risk of exploit and result in system compromise, information leaks, or denial of service. We leveraged the wealth of C and C++ open-source code available to develop a large-scale function-level vulnerability detection system using machine learning. To supplement existing labeled vulnerability datasets, we compiled a vast dataset of millions of open-source functions and labeled it with carefully-selected findings from three different static analyzers that indicate potential exploits. The labeled dataset is available at: https://osf.io/d45bw/. Using these datasets, we developed a fast and scalable vulnerability detection tool based on deep feature representation learning that directly interprets lexed source code. We evaluated our tool on code from both real software packages and the NIST SATE IV benchmark dataset. Our results demonstrate that deep feature representation learning on source code is a promising approach for automated software vulnerability detection.\n",
      "Building agents that can explore their environments intelligently is a challenging open problem. In this paper, we make a step towards understanding how a hierarchical design of the agent's policy can affect its exploration capabilities. First, we design EscapeRoom environments, where the agent must figure out how to navigate to the exit by accomplishing a number of intermediate tasks (\\emph{subgoals}), such as finding keys or opening doors. Our environments are procedurally generated and vary in complexity, which can be controlled by the number of subgoals and relationships between them. Next, we propose to measure the complexity of each environment by constructing dependency graphs between the goals and analytically computing \\emph{hitting times} of a random walk in the graph. We empirically evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with sparse and shaped rewards, a variation of policy sketches, and a hierarchical version of PPO (called HiPPO) akin to h-DQN. We show that analytically estimated \\emph{hitting time} in goal dependency graphs is an informative metric of the environment complexity. We conjecture that the result should hold for environments other than navigation. Finally, we show that solving environments beyond certain level of complexity requires hierarchical approaches.\n",
      "We introduce a new scene graph generation method called image-level attentional context modeling (ILAC). Our model includes an attentional graph network that effectively propagates contextual information across the graph using image-level features. Whereas previous works use an object-centric context, we build an image-level context agent to encode the scene properties. The proposed method comprises a single-stream network that iteratively refines the scene graph with a nested graph neural network. We demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art for scene graph generation on the Visual Genome dataset, while requiring fewer parameters than other methods. We also show that ILAC can improve regular object detectors by incorporating relational image-level information.\n",
      "We tackle the blackbox issue of deep neural networks in the settings of reinforcement learning (RL) where neural agents learn towards maximizing reward gains in an uncontrollable way. Such learning approach is risky when the interacting environment includes an expanse of state space because it is then almost impossible to foresee all unwanted outcomes and penalize them with negative rewards beforehand. Unlike reverse analysis of learned neural features from previous works, our proposed method \\nj{tackles the blackbox issue by encouraging} an RL policy network to learn interpretable latent features through an implementation of a disentangled representation learning method. Toward this end, our method allows an RL agent to understand self-efficacy by distinguishing its influences from uncontrollable environmental factors, which closely resembles the way humans understand their scenes. Our experimental results show that the learned latent factors not only are interpretable, but also enable modeling the distribution of entire visited state space with a specific action condition. We have experimented that this characteristic of the proposed structure can lead to ex post facto governance for desired behaviors of RL agents.\n",
      "Since its introduction, unsupervised representation learning has attracted a lot of attention from the research community, as it is demonstrated to be highly effective and easy-to-apply in tasks such as dimension reduction, clustering, visualization, information retrieval, and semi-supervised learning. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised representation learning framework called neighbor-encoder, in which domain knowledge can be easily incorporated into the learning process without modifying the general encoder-decoder architecture of the classic autoencoder.In contrast to autoencoder, which reconstructs the input data itself, neighbor-encoder reconstructs the input data's neighbors. As the proposed representation learning problem is essentially a neighbor reconstruction problem, domain knowledge can be easily incorporated in the form of an appropriate definition of similarity between objects. Based on that observation, our framework can leverage any off-the-shelf similarity search algorithms or side information to find the neighbor of an input object. Applications of other algorithms (e.g., association rule mining) in our framework are also possible, given that the appropriate definition of neighbor can vary in different contexts. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework in many diverse domains, including images, text, and time series, and for various data mining tasks including classification, clustering, and visualization. Experimental results show that neighbor-encoder not only outperforms autoencoder in most of the scenarios we consider, but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance on text document clustering.\n",
      "Intrinsically motivated goal exploration processes enable agents to autonomously sample goals to explore efficiently complex environments with high-dimensional continuous actions. They have been applied successfully to real world robots to discover repertoires of policies producing a wide diversity of effects. Often these algorithms relied on engineered goal spaces but it was recently shown that one can use deep representation learning algorithms to learn an adequate goal space in simple environments. However, in the case of more complex environments containing multiple objects or distractors, an efficient exploration requires that the structure of the goal space reflects the one of the environment. In this paper we show that using a disentangled goal space leads to better exploration performances than an entangled goal space. We further show that when the representation is disentangled, one can leverage it by sampling goals that maximize learning progress in a modular manner. Finally, we show that the measure of learning progress, used to drive curiosity-driven exploration, can be used simultaneously to discover abstract independently controllable features of the environment.\n",
      "Recent advances in representation learning on graphs, mainly leveraging graph convolutional networks, have brought a substantial improvement on many graph-based benchmark tasks. While novel approaches to learning node embeddings are highly suitable for node classification and link prediction, their application to graph classification (predicting a single label for the entire graph) remains mostly rudimentary, typically using a single global pooling step to aggregate node features or a hand-designed, fixed heuristic for hierarchical coarsening of the graph structure. An important step towards ameliorating this is differentiable graph coarsening---the ability to reduce the size of the graph in an adaptive, data-dependent manner within a graph neural network pipeline, analogous to image downsampling within CNNs. However, the previous prominent approach to pooling has quadratic memory requirements during training and is therefore not scalable to large graphs. Here we combine several recent advances in graph neural network design to demonstrate that competitive hierarchical graph classification results are possible without sacrificing sparsity. Our results are verified on several established graph classification benchmarks, and highlight an important direction for future research in graph-based neural networks.\n",
      "Intrinsically motivated goal exploration algorithms enable machines to discover repertoires of policies that produce a diversity of effects in complex environments. These exploration algorithms have been shown to allow real world robots to acquire skills such as tool use in high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. However, they have so far assumed that self-generated goals are sampled in a specifically engineered feature space, limiting their autonomy. In this work, we propose to use deep representation learning algorithms to learn an adequate goal space. This is a developmental 2-stage approach: first, in a perceptual learning stage, deep learning algorithms use passive raw sensor observations of world changes to learn a corresponding latent space; then goal exploration happens in a second stage by sampling goals in this latent space. We present experiments where a simulated robot arm interacts with an object, and we show that exploration algorithms using such learned representations can match the performance obtained using engineered representations.\n",
      "Deep neural networks, including recurrent networks, have been successfully applied to human activity recognition. Unfortunately, the final representation learned by recurrent networks might encode some noise (irrelevant signal components, unimportant sensor modalities, etc.). Besides, it is difficult to interpret the recurrent networks to gain insight into the models' behavior. To address these issues, we propose two attention models for human activity recognition: temporal attention and sensor attention. These two mechanisms adaptively focus on important signals and sensor modalities. To further improve the understandability and mean F1 score, we add continuity constraints, considering that continuous sensor signals are more robust than discrete ones. We evaluate the approaches on three datasets and obtain state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, qualitative analysis shows that the attention learned by the models agree well with human intuition.\n",
      "In this work, we propose an ensemble of classifiers to distinguish between various degrees of abnormalities of the heart using Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals acquired using digital stethoscopes in a clinical setting, for the INTERSPEECH 2018 Computational Paralinguistics (ComParE) Heart Beats SubChallenge. Our primary classification framework constitutes a convolutional neural network with 1D-CNN time-convolution (tConv) layers, which uses features transferred from a model trained on the 2016 Physionet Heart Sound Database. We also employ a Representation Learning (RL) approach to generate features in an unsupervised manner using Deep Recurrent Autoencoders and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifiers. Finally, we utilize an SVM classifier on a high-dimensional segment-level feature extracted using various functionals on short-term acoustic features, i.e., Low-Level Descriptors (LLD). An ensemble of the three different approaches provides a relative improvement of 11.13% compared to our best single sub-system in terms of the Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) performance metric on the evaluation dataset.\n",
      "This paper presents an automatic network adaptation method that finds a ConvNet structure well-suited to a given target task, e.g., image classification, for efficiency as well as accuracy in transfer learning. We call the concept target-aware transfer learning. Given only small-scale labeled data, and starting from an ImageNet pre-trained network, we exploit a scheme of removing its potential redundancy for the target task through iterative operations of filter-wise pruning and network optimization. The basic motivation is that compact networks are on one hand more efficient and should also be more tolerant, being less complex, against the risk of overfitting which would hinder the generalization of learned representations in the context of transfer learning. Further, unlike existing methods involving network simplification, we also let the scheme identify redundant portions across the entire network, which automatically results in a network structure adapted to the task at hand. We achieve this with a few novel ideas: (i) cumulative sum of activation statistics for each layer, and (ii) a priority evaluation of pruning across multiple layers. Experimental results by the method on five datasets (Flower102, CUB200-2011, Dog120, MIT67, and Stanford40) show favorable accuracies over the related state-of-the-art techniques while enhancing the computational and storage efficiency of the transferred model.\n",
      "Talent search and recommendation systems at LinkedIn strive to match the potential candidates to the hiring needs of a recruiter or a hiring manager expressed in terms of a search query or a job posting. Recent work in this domain has mainly focused on linear models, which do not take complex relationships between features into account, as well as ensemble tree models, which introduce non-linearity but are still insufficient for exploring all the potential feature interactions, and strictly separate feature generation from modeling. In this paper, we present the results of our application of deep and representation learning models on LinkedIn Recruiter. Our key contributions include: (i) Learning semantic representations of sparse entities within the talent search domain, such as recruiter ids, candidate ids, and skill entity ids, for which we utilize neural network models that take advantage of LinkedIn Economic Graph, and (ii) Deep models for learning recruiter engagement and candidate response in talent search applications. We also explore learning to rank approaches applied to deep models, and show the benefits for the talent search use case. Finally, we present offline and online evaluation results for LinkedIn talent search and recommendation systems, and discuss potential challenges along the path to a fully deep model architecture. The challenges and approaches discussed generalize to any multi-faceted search engine.\n",
      "Deep learning algorithms excel at extracting patterns from raw data, and with large datasets, they have been very successful in computer vision and natural language applications. However, in other domains, large datasets on which to learn representations from may not exist. In this work, we develop a novel multimodal CNN-MLP neural network architecture that utilizes both domain-specific feature engineering as well as learned representations from raw data. We illustrate the effectiveness of such network designs in the chemical sciences, for predicting biodegradability. DeepBioD, a multimodal CNN-MLP network is more accurate than either standalone network designs, and achieves an error classification rate of 0.125 that is 27% lower than the current state-of-the-art. Thus, our work indicates that combining traditional feature engineering with representation learning can be effective, particularly in situations where labeled data is limited.\n",
      "Deep neural networks (DNN) excel at extracting patterns. Through representation learning and automated feature engineering on large datasets, such models have been highly successful in computer vision and natural language applications. Designing optimal network architectures from a principled or rational approach however has been less than successful, with the best successful approaches utilizing an additional machine learning algorithm to tune the network hyperparameters. However, in many technical fields, there exist established domain knowledge and understanding about the subject matter. In this work, we develop a novel furcated neural network architecture that utilizes domain knowledge as high-level design principles of the network. We demonstrate proof-of-concept by developing IL-Net, a furcated network for predicting the properties of ionic liquids, which is a class of complex multi-chemicals entities. Compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, we show that furcated networks can improve model accuracy by approximately 20-35%, without using additional labeled data. Lastly, we distill two key design principles for furcated networks that can be adapted to other domains.\n",
      "The success of graph embeddings or node representation learning in a variety of downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and recommendation systems, has led to their popularity in recent years. Representation learning algorithms aim to preserve local and global network structure by identifying node neighborhood notions. However, many existing algorithms generate embeddings that fail to properly preserve the network structure, or lead to unstable representations due to random processes (e.g., random walks to generate context) and, thus, cannot generate to multi-graph problems. In this paper, we propose RECS, a novel, stable graph embedding algorithmic framework. RECS learns graph representations using connection subgraphs by employing the analogy of graphs with electrical circuits. It preserves both local and global connectivity patterns, and addresses the issue of high-degree nodes. Further, it exploits the strength of weak ties and meta-data that have been neglected by baselines. The experiments show that RECS outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 36.85% on multi-label classification problem. Further, in contrast to baselines, RECS, being deterministic, is completely stable.\n",
      "We examine two fundamental tasks associated with graph representation learning: link prediction and semi-supervised node classification. We present a novel autoencoder architecture capable of learning a joint representation of both local graph structure and available node features for the multi-task learning of link prediction and node classification. Our autoencoder architecture is efficiently trained end-to-end in a single learning stage to simultaneously perform link prediction and node classification, whereas previous related methods require multiple training steps that are difficult to optimize. We provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of our models on nine benchmark graph-structured datasets and demonstrate significant improvement over related methods for graph representation learning. Reference code and data are available at https://github.com/vuptran/graph-representation-learning\n",
      "In recent years, deep generative models have been shown to 'imagine' convincing high-dimensional observations such as images, audio, and even video, learning directly from raw data. In this work, we ask how to imagine goal-directed visual plans -- a plausible sequence of observations that transition a dynamical system from its current configuration to a desired goal state, which can later be used as a reference trajectory for control. We focus on systems with high-dimensional observations, such as images, and propose an approach that naturally combines representation learning and planning. Our framework learns a generative model of sequential observations, where the generative process is induced by a transition in a low-dimensional planning model, and an additional noise. By maximizing the mutual information between the generated observations and the transition in the planning model, we obtain a low-dimensional representation that best explains the causal nature of the data. We structure the planning model to be compatible with efficient planning algorithms, and we propose several such models based on either discrete or continuous states. Finally, to generate a visual plan, we project the current and goal observations onto their respective states in the planning model, plan a trajectory, and then use the generative model to transform the trajectory to a sequence of observations. We demonstrate our method on imagining plausible visual plans of rope manipulation.\n",
      "Knowledge graphs have emerged as an important model for studying complex multi-relational data. This has given rise to the construction of numerous large scale but incomplete knowledge graphs encoding information extracted from various resources. An effective and scalable approach to jointly learn over multiple graphs and eventually construct a unified graph is a crucial next step for the success of knowledge-based inference for many downstream applications. To this end, we propose LinkNBed, a deep relational learning framework that learns entity and relationship representations across multiple graphs. We identify entity linkage across graphs as a vital component to achieve our goal. We design a novel objective that leverage entity linkage and build an efficient multi-task training procedure. Experiments on link prediction and entity linkage demonstrate substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art relational learning approaches.\n",
      "We demonstrate an approach to face attribute detection that retains or improves attribute detection accuracy across gender and race subgroups by learning demographic information prior to learning the attribute detection task. The system, which we call InclusiveFaceNet, detects face attributes by transferring race and gender representations learned from a held-out dataset of public race and gender identities. Leveraging learned demographic representations while withholding demographic inference from the downstream face attribute detection task preserves potential users' demographic privacy while resulting in some of the best reported numbers to date on attribute detection in the Faces of the World and CelebA datasets.\n",
      "Using established principles from Statistics and Information Theory, we show that invariance to nuisance factors in a deep neural network is equivalent to information minimality of the learned representation, and that stacking layers and injecting noise during training naturally bias the network towards learning invariant representations. We then decompose the cross-entropy loss used during training and highlight the presence of an inherent overfitting term. We propose regularizing the loss by bounding such a term in two equivalent ways: One with a Kullbach-Leibler term, which relates to a PAC-Bayes perspective; the other using the information in the weights as a measure of complexity of a learned model, yielding a novel Information Bottleneck for the weights. Finally, we show that invariance and independence of the components of the representation learned by the network are bounded above and below by the information in the weights, and therefore are implicitly optimized during training. The theory enables us to quantify and predict sharp phase transitions between underfitting and overfitting of random labels when using our regularized loss, which we verify in experiments, and sheds light on the relation between the geometry of the loss function, invariance properties of the learned representation, and generalization error.\n",
      "Recent deep learning approaches for representation learning on graphs follow a neighborhood aggregation procedure. We analyze some important properties of these models, and propose a strategy to overcome those. In particular, the range of \"neighboring\" nodes that a node's representation draws from strongly depends on the graph structure, analogous to the spread of a random walk. To adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture -- jumping knowledge (JK) networks -- that flexibly leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models' performance.\n",
      "A cognitive model of human learning provides information about skills a learner must acquire to perform accurately in a task domain. Cognitive models of learning are not only of scientific interest, but are also valuable in adaptive online tutoring systems. A more accurate model yields more effective tutoring through better instructional decisions. Prior methods of automated cognitive model discovery have typically focused on well-structured domains, relied on student performance data or involved substantial human knowledge engineering. In this paper, we propose Cognitive Representation Learner (CogRL), a novel framework to learn accurate cognitive models in ill-structured domains with no data and little to no human knowledge engineering. Our contribution is two-fold: firstly, we show that representations learnt using CogRL can be used for accurate automatic cognitive model discovery without using any student performance data in several ill-structured domains: Rumble Blocks, Chinese Character, and Article Selection. This is especially effective and useful in domains where an accurate human-authored cognitive model is unavailable or authoring a cognitive model is difficult. Secondly, for domains where a cognitive model is available, we show that representations learned through CogRL can be used to get accurate estimates of skill difficulty and learning rate parameters without using any student performance data. These estimates are shown to highly correlate with estimates using student performance data on an Article Selection dataset.\n",
      "Learning expressive low-dimensional representations of ultrahigh-dimensional data, e.g., data with thousands/millions of features, has been a major way to enable learning methods to address the curse of dimensionality. However, existing unsupervised representation learning methods mainly focus on preserving the data regularity information and learning the representations independently of subsequent outlier detection methods, which can result in suboptimal and unstable performance of detecting irregularities (i.e., outliers).   This paper introduces a ranking model-based framework, called RAMODO, to address this issue. RAMODO unifies representation learning and outlier detection to learn low-dimensional representations that are tailored for a state-of-the-art outlier detection approach - the random distance-based approach. This customized learning yields more optimal and stable representations for the targeted outlier detectors. Additionally, RAMODO can leverage little labeled data as prior knowledge to learn more expressive and application-relevant representations. We instantiate RAMODO to an efficient method called REPEN to demonstrate the performance of RAMODO.   Extensive empirical results on eight real-world ultrahigh dimensional data sets show that REPEN (i) enables a random distance-based detector to obtain significantly better AUC performance and two orders of magnitude speedup; (ii) performs substantially better and more stably than four state-of-the-art representation learning methods; and (iii) leverages less than 1% labeled data to achieve up to 32% AUC improvement.\n",
      "In this work, we take a representation learning perspective on hierarchical reinforcement learning, where the problem of learning lower layers in a hierarchy is transformed into the problem of learning trajectory-level generative models. We show that we can learn continuous latent representations of trajectories, which are effective in solving temporally extended and multi-stage problems. Our proposed model, SeCTAR, draws inspiration from variational autoencoders, and learns latent representations of trajectories. A key component of this method is to learn both a latent-conditioned policy and a latent-conditioned model which are consistent with each other. Given the same latent, the policy generates a trajectory which should match the trajectory predicted by the model. This model provides a built-in prediction mechanism, by predicting the outcome of closed loop policy behavior. We propose a novel algorithm for performing hierarchical RL with this model, combining model-based planning in the learned latent space with an unsupervised exploration objective. We show that our model is effective at reasoning over long horizons with sparse rewards for several simulated tasks, outperforming standard reinforcement learning methods and prior methods for hierarchical reasoning, model-based planning, and exploration.\n",
      "Domain adaptation is an important open problem in deep reinforcement learning (RL). In many scenarios of interest data is hard to obtain, so agents may learn a source policy in a setting where data is readily available, with the hope that it generalises well to the target domain. We propose a new multi-stage RL agent, DARLA (DisentAngled Representation Learning Agent), which learns to see before learning to act. DARLA's vision is based on learning a disentangled representation of the observed environment. Once DARLA can see, it is able to acquire source policies that are robust to many domain shifts - even with no access to the target domain. DARLA significantly outperforms conventional baselines in zero-shot domain adaptation scenarios, an effect that holds across a variety of RL environments (Jaco arm, DeepMind Lab) and base RL algorithms (DQN, A3C and EC).\n",
      "Observational studies are rising in importance due to the widespread accumulation of data in fields such as healthcare, education, employment and ecology. We consider the task of answering counterfactual questions such as, \"Would this patient have lower blood sugar had she received a different medication?\". We propose a new algorithmic framework for counterfactual inference which brings together ideas from domain adaptation and representation learning. In addition to a theoretical justification, we perform an empirical comparison with previous approaches to causal inference from observational data. Our deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.\n",
      "Representation learning is at the heart of what makes deep learning effective. In this work, we introduce a new framework for representation learning that we call \"Holographic Neural Architectures\" (HNAs). In the same way that an observer can experience the 3D structure of a holographed object by looking at its hologram from several angles, HNAs derive Holographic Representations from the training set. These representations can then be explored by moving along a continuous bounded single dimension. We show that HNAs can be used to make generative networks, state-of-the-art regression models and that they are inherently highly resistant to noise. Finally, we argue that because of their denoising abilities and their capacity to generalize well from very few examples, models based upon HNAs are particularly well suited for biological applications where training examples are rare or noisy.\n",
      "Current deep learning based text classification methods are limited by their ability to achieve fast learning and generalization when the data is scarce. We address this problem by integrating a meta-learning procedure that uses the knowledge learned across many tasks as an inductive bias towards better natural language understanding. Based on the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning framework (MAML), we introduce the Attentive Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (ATAML) algorithm for text classification. The essential difference between MAML and ATAML is in the separation of task-agnostic representation learning and task-specific attentive adaptation. The proposed ATAML is designed to encourage task-agnostic representation learning by way of task-agnostic parameterization and facilitate task-specific adaptation via attention mechanisms. We provide evidence to show that the attention mechanism in ATAML has a synergistic effect on learning performance. In comparisons with models trained from random initialization, pretrained models and meta trained MAML, our proposed ATAML method generalizes better on single-label and multi-label classification tasks in miniRCV1 and miniReuters-21578 datasets.\n",
      "While deep learning methods are increasingly being applied to tasks such as computer-aided diagnosis, these models are difficult to interpret, do not incorporate prior domain knowledge, and are often considered as a \"black-box.\" The lack of model interpretability hinders them from being fully understood by target users such as radiologists. In this paper, we present a novel interpretable deep hierarchical semantic convolutional neural network (HSCNN) to predict whether a given pulmonary nodule observed on a computed tomography (CT) scan is malignant. Our network provides two levels of output: 1) low-level radiologist semantic features, and 2) a high-level malignancy prediction score. The low-level semantic outputs quantify the diagnostic features used by radiologists and serve to explain how the model interprets the images in an expert-driven manner. The information from these low-level tasks, along with the representations learned by the convolutional layers, are then combined and used to infer the high-level task of predicting nodule malignancy. This unified architecture is trained by optimizing a global loss function including both low- and high-level tasks, thereby learning all the parameters within a joint framework. Our experimental results using the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) show that the proposed method not only produces interpretable lung cancer predictions but also achieves significantly better results compared to common 3D CNN approaches.\n",
      "Few-shot learning that trains image classifiers over few labeled examples per category is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose to exploit an additional big dataset with different categories to improve the accuracy of few-shot learning over our target dataset. Our approach is based on the observation that images can be decomposed into objects, which may appear in images from both the additional dataset and our target dataset. We use the object-level relation learned from the additional dataset to infer the similarity of images in our target dataset with unseen categories. Nearest neighbor search is applied to do image classification, which is a non-parametric model and thus does not need fine-tuning. We evaluate our algorithm on two popular datasets, namely Omniglot and MiniImagenet. We obtain 8.5\\% and 2.7\\% absolute improvements for 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot experiments on MiniImagenet, respectively. Source code will be published upon acceptance.\n",
      "Learning the disentangled representation of interpretable generative factors of data is one of the foundations to allow artificial intelligence to think like people. In this paper, we propose the analogical training strategy for the unsupervised disentangled representation learning in generative models. The analogy is one of the typical cognitive processes, and our proposed strategy is based on the observation that sample pairs in which one is different from the other in one specific generative factor show the same analogical relation. Thus, the generator is trained to generate sample pairs from which a designed classifier can identify the underlying analogical relation. In addition, we propose a disentanglement metric called the subspace score, which is inspired by subspace learning methods and does not require supervised information. Experiments show that our proposed training strategy allows the generative models to find the disentangled factors, and that our methods can give competitive performances as compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Being able to predict what may happen in the future requires an in-depth understanding of the physical and causal rules that govern the world. A model that is able to do so has a number of appealing applications, from robotic planning to representation learning. However, learning to predict raw future observations, such as frames in a video, is exceedingly challenging -- the ambiguous nature of the problem can cause a naively designed model to average together possible futures into a single, blurry prediction. Recently, this has been addressed by two distinct approaches: (a) latent variational variable models that explicitly model underlying stochasticity and (b) adversarially-trained models that aim to produce naturalistic images. However, a standard latent variable model can struggle to produce realistic results, and a standard adversarially-trained model underutilizes latent variables and fails to produce diverse predictions. We show that these distinct methods are in fact complementary. Combining the two produces predictions that look more realistic to human raters and better cover the range of possible futures. Our method outperforms prior and concurrent work in these aspects.\n",
      "A key challenge in complex visuomotor control is learning abstract representations that are effective for specifying goals, planning, and generalization. To this end, we introduce universal planning networks (UPN). UPNs embed differentiable planning within a goal-directed policy. This planning computation unrolls a forward model in a latent space and infers an optimal action plan through gradient descent trajectory optimization. The plan-by-gradient-descent process and its underlying representations are learned end-to-end to directly optimize a supervised imitation learning objective. We find that the representations learned are not only effective for goal-directed visual imitation via gradient-based trajectory optimization, but can also provide a metric for specifying goals using images. The learned representations can be leveraged to specify distance-based rewards to reach new target states for model-free reinforcement learning, resulting in substantially more effective learning when solving new tasks described via image-based goals. We were able to achieve successful transfer of visuomotor planning strategies across robots with significantly different morphologies and actuation capabilities.\n",
      "Deep metric learning has been demonstrated to be highly effective in learning semantic representation and encoding information that can be used to measure data similarity, by relying on the embedding learned from metric learning. At the same time, variational autoencoder (VAE) has widely been used to approximate inference and proved to have a good performance for directed probabilistic models. However, for traditional VAE, the data label or feature information are intractable. Similarly, traditional representation learning approaches fail to represent many salient aspects of the data. In this project, we propose a novel integrated framework to learn latent embedding in VAE by incorporating deep metric learning. The features are learned by optimizing a triplet loss on the mean vectors of VAE in conjunction with standard evidence lower bound (ELBO) of VAE. This approach, which we call Triplet based Variational Autoencoder (TVAE), allows us to capture more fine-grained information in the latent embedding. Our model is tested on MNIST data set and achieves a high triplet accuracy of 95.60% while the traditional VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2013) achieves triplet accuracy of 75.08%.\n",
      "The meteoric rise of deep learning models in computer vision research, having achieved human-level accuracy in image recognition tasks is firm evidence of the impact of representation learning of deep neural networks. In the chemistry domain, recent advances have also led to the development of similar CNN models, such as Chemception, that is trained to predict chemical properties using images of molecular drawings. In this work, we investigate the effects of systematically removing and adding localized domain-specific information to the image channels of the training data. By augmenting images with only 3 additional basic information, and without introducing any architectural changes, we demonstrate that an augmented Chemception (AugChemception) outperforms the original model in the prediction of toxicity, activity, and solvation free energy. Then, by altering the information content in the images, and examining the resulting model's performance, we also identify two distinct learning patterns in predicting toxicity/activity as compared to solvation free energy. These patterns suggest that Chemception is learning about its tasks in the manner that is consistent with established knowledge. Thus, our work demonstrates that advanced chemical knowledge is not a pre-requisite for deep learning models to accurately predict complex chemical properties.\n",
      "Options in reinforcement learning allow agents to hierarchically decompose a task into subtasks, having the potential to speed up learning and planning. However, autonomously learning effective sets of options is still a major challenge in the field. In this paper we focus on the recently introduced idea of using representation learning methods to guide the option discovery process. Specifically, we look at eigenoptions, options obtained from representations that encode diffusive information flow in the environment. We extend the existing algorithms for eigenoption discovery to settings with stochastic transitions and in which handcrafted features are not available. We propose an algorithm that discovers eigenoptions while learning non-linear state representations from raw pixels. It exploits recent successes in the deep reinforcement learning literature and the equivalence between proto-value functions and the successor representation. We use traditional tabular domains to provide intuition about our approach and Atari 2600 games to demonstrate its potential.\n",
      "Learning meaningful representations that maintain the content necessary for a particular task while filtering away detrimental variations is a problem of great interest in machine learning. In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning representations invariant to a specific factor or trait of data. The representation learning process is formulated as an adversarial minimax game. We analyze the optimal equilibrium of such a game and find that it amounts to maximizing the uncertainty of inferring the detrimental factor given the representation while maximizing the certainty of making task-specific predictions. On three benchmark tasks, namely fair and bias-free classification, language-independent generation, and lighting-independent image classification, we show that the proposed framework induces an invariant representation, and leads to better generalization evidenced by the improved performance.\n",
      "Time series data constitutes a distinct and growing problem in machine learning. As the corpus of time series data grows larger, deep models that simultaneously learn features and classify with these features can be intractable or suboptimal. In this paper, we present feature learning via long short term memory (LSTM) networks and prediction via gradient boosting trees (XGB). Focusing on the consequential setting of electronic health record data, we predict the occurrence of hypoxemia five minutes into the future based on past features. We make two observations: 1) long short term memory networks are effective at capturing long term dependencies based on a single feature and 2) gradient boosting trees are capable of tractably combining a large number of features including static features like height and weight. With these observations in mind, we generate features by performing \"supervised\" representation learning with LSTM networks. Augmenting the original XGB model with these features gives significantly better performance than either individual method.\n",
      "Graphs (networks) are ubiquitous and allow us to model entities (nodes) and the dependencies (edges) between them. Learning a useful feature representation from graph data lies at the heart and success of many machine learning tasks such as classification, anomaly detection, link prediction, among many others. Many existing techniques use random walks as a basis for learning features or estimating the parameters of a graph model for a downstream prediction task. Examples include recent node embedding methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, as well as graph-based deep learning algorithms. However, the simple random walk used by these methods is fundamentally tied to the identity of the node. This has three main disadvantages. First, these approaches are inherently transductive and do not generalize to unseen nodes and other graphs. Second, they are not space-efficient as a feature vector is learned for each node which is impractical for large graphs. Third, most of these approaches lack support for attributed graphs.   To make these methods more generally applicable, we propose a framework for inductive network representation learning based on the notion of attributed random walk that is not tied to node identity and is instead based on learning a function $\\Phi : \\mathrm{\\rm \\bf x} \\rightarrow w$ that maps a node attribute vector $\\mathrm{\\rm \\bf x}$ to a type $w$. This framework serves as a basis for generalizing existing methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and many other previous methods that leverage traditional random walks.\n",
      "Random walks are at the heart of many existing deep learning algorithms for graph data. However, such algorithms have many limitations that arise from the use of random walks, e.g., the features resulting from these methods are unable to transfer to new nodes and graphs as they are tied to node identity. In this work, we introduce the notion of attributed random walks which serves as a basis for generalizing existing methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and many others that leverage random walks. Our proposed framework enables these methods to be more widely applicable for both transductive and inductive learning as well as for use on graphs with attributes (if available). This is achieved by learning functions that generalize to new nodes and graphs. We show that our proposed framework is effective with an average AUC improvement of 16.1% while requiring on average 853 times less space than existing methods on a variety of graphs from several domains.\n",
      "The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with high capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of large-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10x or 100x? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.\n",
      "Video Question Answering is a challenging problem in visual information retrieval, which provides the answer to the referenced video content according to the question. However, the existing visual question answering approaches mainly tackle the problem of static image question, which may be ineffectively for video question answering due to the insufficiency of modeling the temporal dynamics of video contents. In this paper, we study the problem of video question answering by modeling its temporal dynamics with frame-level attention mechanism. We propose the attribute-augmented attention network learning framework that enables the joint frame-level attribute detection and unified video representation learning for video question answering. We then incorporate the multi-step reasoning process for our proposed attention network to further improve the performance. We construct a large-scale video question answering dataset. We conduct the experiments on both multiple-choice and open-ended video question answering tasks to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",
      "Representation learning and option discovery are two of the biggest challenges in reinforcement learning (RL). Proto-value functions (PVFs) are a well-known approach for representation learning in MDPs. In this paper we address the option discovery problem by showing how PVFs implicitly define options. We do it by introducing eigenpurposes, intrinsic reward functions derived from the learned representations. The options discovered from eigenpurposes traverse the principal directions of the state space. They are useful for multiple tasks because they are discovered without taking the environment's rewards into consideration. Moreover, different options act at different time scales, making them helpful for exploration. We demonstrate features of eigenpurposes in traditional tabular domains as well as in Atari 2600 games.\n",
      "We present Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (DGCCA) -- a method for learning nonlinear transformations of arbitrarily many views of data, such that the resulting transformations are maximally informative of each other. While methods for nonlinear two-view representation learning (Deep CCA, (Andrew et al., 2013)) and linear many-view representation learning (Generalized CCA (Horst, 1961)) exist, DGCCA is the first CCA-style multiview representation learning technique that combines the flexibility of nonlinear (deep) representation learning with the statistical power of incorporating information from many independent sources, or views. We present the DGCCA formulation as well as an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for solving it. We learn DGCCA representations on two distinct datasets for three downstream tasks: phonetic transcription from acoustic and articulatory measurements, and recommending hashtags and friends on a dataset of Twitter users. We find that DGCCA representations soundly beat existing methods at phonetic transcription and hashtag recommendation, and in general perform no worse than standard linear many-view techniques.\n",
      "Combining abstract, symbolic reasoning with continuous neural reasoning is a grand challenge of representation learning. As a step in this direction, we propose a new architecture, called neural equivalence networks, for the problem of learning continuous semantic representations of algebraic and logical expressions. These networks are trained to represent semantic equivalence, even of expressions that are syntactically very different. The challenge is that semantic representations must be computed in a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional, but at the same time, small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in semantics, which can be difficult for continuous neural architectures. We perform an exhaustive evaluation on the task of checking equivalence on a highly diverse class of symbolic algebraic and boolean expression types, showing that our model significantly outperforms existing architectures.\n",
      "A framework is presented for unsupervised learning of representations based on infomax principle for large-scale neural populations. We use an asymptotic approximation to the Shannon's mutual information for a large neural population to demonstrate that a good initial approximation to the global information-theoretic optimum can be obtained by a hierarchical infomax method. Starting from the initial solution, an efficient algorithm based on gradient descent of the final objective function is proposed to learn representations from the input datasets, and the method works for complete, overcomplete, and undercomplete bases. As confirmed by numerical experiments, our method is robust and highly efficient for extracting salient features from input datasets. Compared with the main existing methods, our algorithm has a distinct advantage in both the training speed and the robustness of unsupervised representation learning. Furthermore, the proposed method is easily extended to the supervised or unsupervised model for training deep structure networks.\n",
      "Advances in neural network based classifiers have transformed automatic feature learning from a pipe dream of stronger AI to a routine and expected property of practical systems. Since the emergence of AlexNet every winning submission of the ImageNet challenge has employed end-to-end representation learning, and due to the utility of good representations for transfer learning, representation learning has become as an important and distinct task from supervised learning. At present, this distinction is inconsequential, as supervised methods are state-of-the-art in learning transferable representations. But recent work has shown that generative models can also be powerful agents of representation learning. Will the representations learned from these generative methods ever rival the quality of those from their supervised competitors? In this work, we argue in the affirmative, that from an information theoretic perspective, generative models have greater potential for representation learning. Based on several experimentally validated assumptions, we show that supervised learning is upper bounded in its capacity for representation learning in ways that certain generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are not. We hope that our analysis will provide a rigorous motivation for further exploration of generative representation learning.\n",
      "While great strides have been made in using deep learning algorithms to solve supervised learning tasks, the problem of unsupervised learning - leveraging unlabeled examples to learn about the structure of a domain - remains a difficult unsolved challenge. Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a video sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the structure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network (\"PredNet\") architecture that is inspired by the concept of \"predictive coding\" from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks learn internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. Altogether, these results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure.\n",
      "In application domains such as healthcare, we want accurate predictive models that are also causally interpretable. In pursuit of such models, we propose a causal regularizer to steer predictive models towards causally-interpretable solutions and theoretically study its properties. In a large-scale analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR), our causally-regularized model outperforms its L1-regularized counterpart in causal accuracy and is competitive in predictive performance. We perform non-linear causality analysis by causally regularizing a special neural network architecture. We also show that the proposed causal regularizer can be used together with neural representation learning algorithms to yield up to 20% improvement over multilayer perceptron in detecting multivariate causation, a situation common in healthcare, where many causal factors should occur simultaneously to have an effect on the target variable.\n",
      "In this paper, we focus on online representation learning in non-stationary environments which may require continuous adaptation of model architecture. We propose a novel online dictionary-learning (sparse-coding) framework which incorporates the addition and deletion of hidden units (dictionary elements), and is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be associated with improved cognitive function and adaptation to new environments. In the online learning setting, where new input instances arrive sequentially in batches, the neuronal-birth is implemented by adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate. Neuronal-death is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity) on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each iteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates between the code and dictionary updates. Finally, hidden unit connectivity adaptation is facilitated by introducing sparsity in dictionary elements. Our empirical evaluation on several real-life datasets (images and language) as well as on synthetic data demonstrates that the proposed approach can considerably outperform the state-of-art fixed-size (nonadaptive) online sparse coding of Mairal et al. (2009) in the presence of nonstationary data. Moreover, we identify certain properties of the data (e.g., sparse inputs with nearly non-overlapping supports) and of the model (e.g., dictionary sparsity) associated with such improvements.\n",
      "Limited annotated data available for the recognition of facial expression and action units embarrasses the training of deep networks, which can learn disentangled invariant features. However, a linear model with just several parameters normally is not demanding in terms of training data. In this paper, we propose an elegant linear model to untangle confounding factors in challenging realistic multichannel signals such as 2D face videos. The simple yet powerful model does not rely on huge training data and is natural for recognizing facial actions without explicitly disentangling the identity. Base on well-understood intuitive linear models such as Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC), previous attempts require a prepossessing of explicit decoupling which is practically inexact. Instead, we exploit the low-rank property across frames to subtract the underlying neutral faces which are modeled jointly with sparse representation on the action components with group sparsity enforced. On the extended Cohn-Kanade dataset (CK+), our one-shot automatic method on raw face videos performs as competitive as SRC applied on manually prepared action components and performs even better than SRC in terms of true positive rate. We apply the model to the even more challenging task of facial action unit recognition, verified on the MPI Face Video Database (MPI-VDB) achieving a decent performance. All the programs and data have been made publicly available.\n",
      "In this paper, we study learning generalized driving style representations from automobile GPS trip data. We propose a novel Autoencoder Regularized deep neural Network (ARNet) and a trip encoding framework trip2vec to learn drivers' driving styles directly from GPS records, by combining supervised and unsupervised feature learning in a unified architecture. Experiments on a challenging driver number estimation problem and the driver identification problem show that ARNet can learn a good generalized driving style representation: It significantly outperforms existing methods and alternative architectures by reaching the least estimation error on average (0.68, less than one driver) and the highest identification accuracy (by at least 3% improvement) compared with traditional supervised learning methods.\n",
      "With the resurgence of interest in neural networks, representation learning has re-emerged as a central focus in artificial intelligence. Representation learning refers to the discovery of useful encodings of data that make domain-relevant information explicit. Factorial representations identify underlying independent causal factors of variation in data. A factorial representation is compact and faithful, makes the causal factors explicit, and facilitates human interpretation of data. Factorial representations support a variety of applications, including the generation of novel examples, indexing and search, novelty detection, and transfer learning.   This article surveys various constraints that encourage a learning algorithm to discover factorial representations. I dichotomize the constraints in terms of unsupervised and supervised inductive bias. Unsupervised inductive biases exploit assumptions about the environment, such as the statistical distribution of factor coefficients, assumptions about the perturbations a factor should be invariant to (e.g. a representation of an object can be invariant to rotation, translation or scaling), and assumptions about how factors are combined to synthesize an observation. Supervised inductive biases are constraints on the representations based on additional information connected to observations. Supervisory labels come in variety of types, which vary in how strongly they constrain the representation, how many factors are labeled, how many observations are labeled, and whether or not we know the associations between the constraints and the factors they are related to.   This survey brings together a wide variety of models that all touch on the problem of learning factorial representations and lays out a framework for comparing these models based on the strengths of the underlying supervised and unsupervised inductive biases.\n",
      "Methods based on representation learning currently hold the state-of-the-art in many natural language processing and knowledge base inference tasks. Yet, a major challenge is how to efficiently incorporate commonsense knowledge into such models. A recent approach regularizes relation and entity representations by propositionalization of first-order logic rules. However, propositionalization does not scale beyond domains with only few entities and rules. In this paper we present a highly efficient method for incorporating implication rules into distributed representations for automated knowledge base construction. We map entity-tuple embeddings into an approximately Boolean space and encourage a partial ordering over relation embeddings based on implication rules mined from WordNet. Surprisingly, we find that the strong restriction of the entity-tuple embedding space does not hurt the expressiveness of the model and even acts as a regularizer that improves generalization. By incorporating few commonsense rules, we achieve an increase of 2 percentage points mean average precision over a matrix factorization baseline, while observing a negligible increase in runtime.\n",
      "Probabilistic models learned as density estimators can be exploited in representation learning beside being toolboxes used to answer inference queries only. However, how to extract useful representations highly depends on the particular model involved. We argue that tractable inference, i.e. inference that can be computed in polynomial time, can enable general schemes to extract features from black box models. We plan to investigate how Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) can be exploited to generate embeddings by random query evaluations. We devise two experimental designs to assess and compare different TPMs as feature extractors in an unsupervised representation learning framework. We show some experimental results on standard image datasets by applying such a method to Sum-Product Networks and Mixture of Trees as tractable models generating embeddings.\n",
      "Deep neural networks have become increasingly successful at solving classic perception problems such as object recognition, semantic segmentation, and scene understanding, often reaching or surpassing human-level accuracy. This success is due in part to the ability of DNNs to learn useful representations of high-dimensional inputs, a problem that humans must also solve. We examine the relationship between the representations learned by these networks and human psychological representations recovered from similarity judgments. We find that deep features learned in service of object classification account for a significant amount of the variance in human similarity judgments for a set of animal images. However, these features do not capture some qualitative distinctions that are a key part of human representations. To remedy this, we develop a method for adapting deep features to align with human similarity judgments, resulting in image representations that can potentially be used to extend the scope of psychological experiments.\n",
      "This paper addresses classification tasks on a particular target domain in which labeled training data are only available from source domains different from (but related to) the target. Two closely related frameworks, domain adaptation and domain generalization, are concerned with such tasks, where the only difference between those frameworks is the availability of the unlabeled target data: domain adaptation can leverage unlabeled target information, while domain generalization cannot. We propose Scatter Component Analyis (SCA), a fast representation learning algorithm that can be applied to both domain adaptation and domain generalization. SCA is based on a simple geometrical measure, i.e., scatter, which operates on reproducing kernel Hilbert space. SCA finds a representation that trades between maximizing the separability of classes, minimizing the mismatch between domains, and maximizing the separability of data; each of which is quantified through scatter. The optimization problem of SCA can be reduced to a generalized eigenvalue problem, which results in a fast and exact solution. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark cross-domain object recognition datasets verify that SCA performs much faster than several state-of-the-art algorithms and also provides state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both domain adaptation and domain generalization. We also show that scatter can be used to establish a theoretical generalization bound in the case of domain adaptation.\n",
      "What is the right supervisory signal to train visual representations? Current approaches in computer vision use category labels from datasets such as ImageNet to train ConvNets. However, in case of biological agents, visual representation learning does not require millions of semantic labels. We argue that biological agents use physical interactions with the world to learn visual representations unlike current vision systems which just use passive observations (images and videos downloaded from web). For example, babies push objects, poke them, put them in their mouth and throw them to learn representations. Towards this goal, we build one of the first systems on a Baxter platform that pushes, pokes, grasps and observes objects in a tabletop environment. It uses four different types of physical interactions to collect more than 130K datapoints, with each datapoint providing supervision to a shared ConvNet architecture allowing us to learn visual representations. We show the quality of learned representations by observing neuron activations and performing nearest neighbor retrieval on this learned representation. Quantitatively, we evaluate our learned ConvNet on image classification tasks and show improvements compared to learning without external data. Finally, on the task of instance retrieval, our network outperforms the ImageNet network on recall@1 by 3%\n",
      "Cross-domain visual data matching is one of the fundamental problems in many real-world vision tasks, e.g., matching persons across ID photos and surveillance videos. Conventional approaches to this problem usually involves two steps: i) projecting samples from different domains into a common space, and ii) computing (dis-)similarity in this space based on a certain distance. In this paper, we present a novel pairwise similarity measure that advances existing models by i) expanding traditional linear projections into affine transformations and ii) fusing affine Mahalanobis distance and Cosine similarity by a data-driven combination. Moreover, we unify our similarity measure with feature representation learning via deep convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we incorporate the similarity measure matrix into the deep architecture, enabling an end-to-end way of model optimization. We extensively evaluate our generalized similarity model in several challenging cross-domain matching tasks: person re-identification under different views and face verification over different modalities (i.e., faces from still images and videos, older and younger faces, and sketch and photo portraits). The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of our model over other state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Most recent work focused on affect from facial expressions, and not as much on body. This work focuses on body affect analysis. Affect does not occur in isolation. Humans usually couple affect with an action in natural interactions; for example, a person could be talking and smiling. Recognizing body affect in sequences requires efficient algorithms to capture both the micro movements that differentiate between happy and sad and the macro variations between different actions. We depart from traditional approaches for time-series data analytics by proposing a multi-task learning model that learns a shared representation that is well-suited for action-affect classification as well as generation. For this paper we choose Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines to be our building block. We propose a new model that enhances the CRBM model with a factored multi-task component to become Multi-Task Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (MTCRBMs). We evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets, the Body Affect dataset and the Tower Game dataset, and show superior classification performance improvement over the state-of-the-art, as well as the generative abilities of our model.\n",
      "This paper investigates the connections between two state of the art classifiers: decision forests (DFs, including decision jungles) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Decision forests are computationally efficient thanks to their conditional computation property (computation is confined to only a small region of the tree, the nodes along a single branch). CNNs achieve state of the art accuracy, thanks to their representation learning capabilities. We present a systematic analysis of how to fuse conditional computation with representation learning and achieve a continuum of hybrid models with different ratios of accuracy vs. efficiency. We call this new family of hybrid models conditional networks. Conditional networks can be thought of as: i) decision trees augmented with data transformation operators, or ii) CNNs, with block-diagonal sparse weight matrices, and explicit data routing functions. Experimental validation is performed on the common task of image classification on both the CIFAR and Imagenet datasets. Compared to state of the art CNNs, our hybrid models yield the same accuracy with a fraction of the compute cost and much smaller number of parameters.\n",
      "A key element in transfer learning is representation learning; if representations can be developed that expose the relevant factors underlying the data, then new tasks and domains can be learned readily based on mappings of these salient factors. We propose that an important aim for these representations are to be unbiased. Different forms of representation learning can be derived from alternative definitions of unwanted bias, e.g., bias to particular tasks, domains, or irrelevant underlying data dimensions. One very useful approach to estimating the amount of bias in a representation comes from maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) [5], a measure of distance between probability distributions. We are not the first to suggest that MMD can be a useful criterion in developing representations that apply across multiple domains or tasks [1]. However, in this paper we describe a number of novel applications of this criterion that we have devised, all based on the idea of developing unbiased representations. These formulations include: a standard domain adaptation framework; a method of learning invariant representations; an approach based on noise-insensitive autoencoders; and a novel form of generative model.\n",
      "Variational autoencoders (VAEs), as an important aspect of generative models, have received a lot of research interests and reached many successful applications. However, it is always a challenge to achieve the consistency between the learned latent distribution and the prior latent distribution when optimizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), and finally leads to an unsatisfactory performance in data generation. In this paper, we propose a latent distribution consistency approach to avoid such substantial inconsistency between the posterior and prior latent distributions in ELBO optimizing. We name our method as latent distribution consistency VAE (LDC-VAE). We achieve this purpose by assuming the real posterior distribution in latent space as a Gibbs form, and approximating it by using our encoder. However, there is no analytical solution for such Gibbs posterior in approximation, and traditional approximation ways are time consuming, such as using the iterative sampling-based MCMC. To address this problem, we use the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to approximate the Gibbs posterior. Meanwhile, we use the SVGD to train a sampler net which can obtain efficient samples from the Gibbs posterior. Comparative studies on the popular image generation datasets show that our method has achieved comparable or even better performance than several powerful improvements of VAEs.\n",
      "A novel explainable AI method called CLEAR Image is introduced in this paper. CLEAR Image is based on the view that a satisfactory explanation should be contrastive, counterfactual and measurable. CLEAR Image explains an image's classification probability by contrasting the image with a corresponding image generated automatically via adversarial learning. This enables both salient segmentation and perturbations that faithfully determine each segment's importance. CLEAR Image was successfully applied to a medical imaging case study where it outperformed methods such as Grad-CAM and LIME by an average of 27% using a novel pointing game metric. CLEAR Image excels in identifying cases of \"causal overdetermination\" where there are multiple patches in an image, any one of which is sufficient by itself to cause the classification probability to be close to one.\n",
      "Generating portrait images by controlling the motions of existing faces is an important task of great consequence to social media industries. For easy use and intuitive control, semantically meaningful and fully disentangled parameters should be used as modifications. However, many existing techniques do not provide such fine-grained controls or use indirect editing methods i.e. mimic motions of other individuals. In this paper, a Portrait Image Neural Renderer (PIRenderer) is proposed to control the face motions with the parameters of three-dimensional morphable face models (3DMMs). The proposed model can generate photo-realistic portrait images with accurate movements according to intuitive modifications. Experiments on both direct and indirect editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of this model. Meanwhile, we further extend this model to tackle the audio-driven facial reenactment task by extracting sequential motions from audio inputs. We show that our model can generate coherent videos with convincing movements from only a single reference image and a driving audio stream. Our source code is available at https://github.com/RenYurui/PIRender.\n",
      "Recent advance in diffusion models incorporates the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), which brings the state-of-the art performance on image generation tasks. This paper improves such diffusion models by analyzing the model at the zero diffusion time. In real datasets, the score function diverges as the diffusion time ($t$) decreases to zero, and this observation leads an argument that the score estimation fails at $t=0$ with any neural network structure. Subsequently, we introduce Unbounded Diffusion Model (UDM) that resolves the score diverging problem with an easily applicable modification to any diffusion models. Additionally, we introduce a new SDE that overcomes the theoretic and practical limitations of Variance Exploding SDE. On top of that, the introduced Soft Truncation method improves the sample quality by mitigating the loss scale issue that happens at $t=0$. We further provide a theoretic result of the proposed method to uncover the behind mechanism of the diffusion models.\n",
      "Training real-world neural network models to achieve high performance and generalizability typically requires a substantial amount of labeled data, spanning a broad range of variation. This data-labeling process can be both labor and cost intensive. To achieve desirable predictive performance, a trained model is typically applied into a domain where the data distribution is similar to the training dataset. However, for many agricultural machine learning problems, training datasets are collected at a specific location, during a specific period in time of the growing season. Since agricultural systems exhibit substantial variability in terms of crop type, cultivar, management, seasonal growth dynamics, lighting condition, sensor type, etc, a model trained from one dataset often does not generalize well across domains. To enable more data efficient and generalizable neural network models in agriculture, we propose a method that generates photorealistic agricultural images from a synthetic 3D crop model domain into real world crop domains. The method uses a semantically constrained GAN (generative adversarial network) to preserve the fruit position and geometry. We observe that a baseline CycleGAN method generates visually realistic target domain images but does not preserve fruit position information while our method maintains fruit positions well. Image generation results in vineyard grape day and night images show the visual outputs of our network are much better compared to a baseline network. Incremental training experiments in vineyard grape detection tasks show that the images generated from our method can significantly speed the domain adaption process, increase performance for a given number of labeled images (i.e. data efficiency), and decrease labeling requirements.\n",
      "Latest Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are gathering outstanding results through a large-scale training, thus employing models composed of millions of parameters requiring extensive computational capabilities. Building such huge models undermines their replicability and increases the training instability. Moreover, multi-channel data, such as images or audio, are usually processed by realvalued convolutional networks that flatten and concatenate the input, often losing intra-channel spatial relations. To address these issues related to complexity and information loss, we propose a family of quaternion-valued generative adversarial networks (QGANs). QGANs exploit the properties of quaternion algebra, e.g., the Hamilton product, that allows to process channels as a single entity and capture internal latent relations, while reducing by a factor of 4 the overall number of parameters. We show how to design QGANs and to extend the proposed approach even to advanced models.We compare the proposed QGANs with real-valued counterparts on several image generation benchmarks. Results show that QGANs are able to obtain better FID scores than real-valued GANs and to generate visually pleasing images. Furthermore, QGANs save up to 75% of the training parameters. We believe these results may pave the way to novel, more accessible, GANs capable of improving performance and saving computational resources.\n",
      "We show that cascaded diffusion models are capable of generating high fidelity images on the class-conditional ImageNet generation challenge, without any assistance from auxiliary image classifiers to boost sample quality. A cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that generate images of increasing resolution, beginning with a standard diffusion model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64x64, 3.52 at 128x128 and 4.88 at 256x256 resolutions, outperforming BigGAN-deep, and classification accuracy scores of 63.02% (top-1) and 84.06% (top-5) at 256x256, outperforming VQ-VAE-2.\n",
      "In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixel arrays. However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image is represented as an implicit neural representation (INR) - an MLP that predicts an RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose two novel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders: factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to build a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs for image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to complex real-world data. Our proposed INR-GAN architecture improves the performance of continuous image generators by several times, greatly reducing the gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. Apart from that, we explore several exciting properties of the INR-based decoders, like out-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation, accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate outside of image boundaries, and strong geometric prior.

      "In this paper, we propose a novel encoder, called ShapeEditor, for high-resolution, realistic and high-fidelity face exchange. First of all, in order to ensure sufficient clarity and authenticity, our key idea is to use an advanced pretrained high-quality random face image generator, i.e. StyleGAN, as backbone. Secondly, we design ShapeEditor, a two-step encoder, to make the swapped face integrate the identity and attribute of the input faces. In the first step, we extract the identity vector of the source image and the attribute vector of the target image respectively; in the second step, we map the concatenation of identity vector and attribute vector into the $\\mathcal{W+}$ potential space. In addition, for learning to map into the latent space of StyleGAN, we propose a set of self-supervised loss functions with which the training data do not need to be labeled manually. Extensive experiments on the test dataset show that the results of our method not only have a great advantage in clarity and authenticity than other state-of-the-art methods, but also reflect the sufficient integration of identity and attribute.\n",
      "We propose a novel and unified Cycle in Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (C2GAN) for generating human faces, hands, bodies, and natural scenes. Our proposed C2GAN is a cross-modal model exploring the joint exploitation of the input image data and guidance data in an interactive manner. C2GAN contains two different generators, i.e., an image-generation generator and a guidance-generation generator. Both generators are mutually connected and trained in an end-to-end fashion and explicitly form three cycled subnets, i.e., one image generation cycle and two guidance generation cycles. Each cycle aims at reconstructing the input domain and simultaneously produces a useful output involved in the generation of another cycle. In this way, the cycles constrain each other implicitly providing complementary information from both image and guidance modalities and bringing an extra supervision gradient across the cycles, facilitating a more robust optimization of the whole model. Extensive results on four guided image-to-image translation subtasks demonstrate that the proposed C2GAN is effective in generating more realistic images compared with state-of-the-art models. The code is available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/C2GAN.\n",
      "Deep visual models are susceptible to adversarial perturbations to inputs. Although these signals are carefully crafted, they still appear noise-like patterns to humans. This observation has led to the argument that deep visual representation is misaligned with human perception. We counter-argue by providing evidence of human-meaningful patterns in adversarial perturbations. We first propose an attack that fools a network to confuse a whole category of objects (source class) with a target label. Our attack also limits the unintended fooling by samples from non-sources classes, thereby circumscribing human-defined semantic notions for network fooling. We show that the proposed attack not only leads to the emergence of regular geometric patterns in the perturbations, but also reveals insightful information about the decision boundaries of deep models. Exploring this phenomenon further, we alter the `adversarial' objective of our attack to use it as a tool to `explain' deep visual representation. We show that by careful channeling and projection of the perturbations computed by our method, we can visualize a model's understanding of human-defined semantic notions. Finally, we exploit the explanability properties of our perturbations to perform image generation, inpainting and interactive image manipulation by attacking adversarialy robust `classifiers'.In all, our major contribution is a novel pragmatic adversarial attack that is subsequently transformed into a tool to interpret the visual models. The article also makes secondary contributions in terms of establishing the utility of our attack beyond the adversarial objective with multiple interesting applications.\n",
      "State-of-the-art (SOTA) Generative Models (GMs) can synthesize photo-realistic images that are hard for humans to distinguish from genuine photos. We propose to perform reverse engineering of GMs to infer the model hyperparameters from the images generated by these models. We define a novel problem, \"model parsing\", as estimating GM network architectures and training loss functions by examining their generated images -- a task seemingly impossible for human beings. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework with two components: a Fingerprint Estimation Network (FEN), which estimates a GM fingerprint from a generated image by training with four constraints to encourage the fingerprint to have desired properties, and a Parsing Network (PN), which predicts network architecture and loss functions from the estimated fingerprints. To evaluate our approach, we collect a fake image dataset with $100$K images generated by $100$ GMs. Extensive experiments show encouraging results in parsing the hyperparameters of the unseen models. Finally, our fingerprint estimation can be leveraged for deepfake detection and image attribution, as we show by reporting SOTA results on both the recent Celeb-DF and image attribution benchmarks.\n",
      "Conditional generative models of high-dimensional images have many applications, but supervision signals from conditions to images can be expensive to acquire. This paper describes Diffusion-Decoding models with Contrastive representations (D2C), a paradigm for training unconditional variational autoencoders (VAEs) for few-shot conditional image generation. D2C uses a learned diffusion-based prior over the latent representations to improve generation and contrastive self-supervised learning to improve representation quality. D2C can adapt to novel generation tasks conditioned on labels or manipulation constraints, by learning from as few as 100 labeled examples. On conditional generation from new labels, D2C achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art VAEs and diffusion models. On conditional image manipulation, D2C generations are two orders of magnitude faster to produce over StyleGAN2 ones and are preferred by 50% - 60% of the human evaluators in a double-blind study.\n",
      "Current vision systems are trained on huge datasets, and these datasets come with costs: curation is expensive, they inherit human biases, and there are concerns over privacy and usage rights. To counter these costs, interest has surged in learning from cheaper data sources, such as unlabeled images. In this paper we go a step further and ask if we can do away with real image datasets entirely, instead learning from noise processes. We investigate a suite of image generation models that produce images from simple random processes. These are then used as training data for a visual representation learner with a contrastive loss. We study two types of noise processes, statistical image models and deep generative models under different random initializations. Our findings show that it is important for the noise to capture certain structural properties of real data but that good performance can be achieved even with processes that are far from realistic. We also find that diversity is a key property to learn good representations. Datasets, models, and code are available at https://mbaradad.github.io/learning_with_noise.\n",
      "Fooling people with highly realistic fake images generated with Deepfake or GANs brings a great social disturbance to our society. Many methods have been proposed to detect fake images, but they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations -- intentionally designed noises that can lead to the wrong prediction. Existing methods of attacking fake image detectors usually generate adversarial perturbations to perturb almost the entire image. This is redundant and increases the perceptibility of perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel method to disrupt the fake image detection by determining key pixels to a fake image detector and attacking only the key pixels, which results in the $L_0$ and the $L_2$ norms of adversarial perturbations much less than those of existing works. Experiments on two public datasets with three fake image detectors indicate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both white-box and black-box attacks.\n",
      "The objective of person re-identification (re-ID) is to retrieve a person's images from an image gallery, given a single instance of the person of interest. Despite several advancements, learning discriminative identity-sensitive and viewpoint invariant features for robust Person Re-identification is a major challenge owing to the large pose variation of humans. This paper proposes a re-ID pipeline that utilizes the image generation capability of Generative Adversarial Networks combined with pose clustering and feature fusion to achieve pose invariant feature learning. The objective is to model a given person under different viewpoints and large pose changes and extract the most discriminative features from all the appearances. The pose transformational GAN (pt-GAN) module is trained to generate a person's image in any given pose. In order to identify the most significant poses for discriminative feature extraction, a Pose Clustering module is proposed. The given instance of the person is modelled in varying poses and these features are effectively combined through the Feature Fusion Network. The final re-ID model consisting of these 3 sub-blocks, alleviates the pose dependence in person re-ID. Also, The proposed model is robust to occlusion, scale, rotation and illumination, providing a framework for viewpoint invariant feature learning. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art GAN based models in 4 benchmark datasets. It also surpasses the state-of-the-art models that report higher re-ID accuracy in terms of improvement over baseline.\n",
      "Deep generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained growing popularity in numerous scenarios, while usually suffer from high parameter complexities for resource-constrained real-world applications. However, the compression of GANs has less been explored. A few works show that heuristically applying compression techniques normally leads to unsatisfactory results, due to the notorious training instability of GANs. In parallel, the lottery ticket hypothesis shows prevailing success on discriminative models, in locating sparse matching subnetworks capable of training in isolation to full model performance. In this work, we for the first time study the existence of such trainable matching subnetworks in deep GANs. For a range of GANs, we certainly find matching subnetworks at 67%-74% sparsity. We observe that with or without pruning discriminator has a minor effect on the existence and quality of matching subnetworks, while the initialization weights used in the discriminator play a significant role. We then show the powerful transferability of these subnetworks to unseen tasks. Furthermore, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our found subnetworks substantially outperform previous state-of-the-art GAN compression approaches in both image generation (e.g. SNGAN) and image-to-image translation GANs (e.g. CycleGAN).

      "Malicious application of deepfakes (i.e., technologies can generate target faces or face attributes) has posed a huge threat to our society. The fake multimedia content generated by deepfake models can harm the reputation and even threaten the property of the person who has been impersonated. Fortunately, the adversarial watermark could be used for combating deepfake models, leading them to generate distorted images. The existing methods require an individual training process for every facial image, to generate the adversarial watermark against a specific deepfake model, which are extremely inefficient. To address this problem, we propose a universal adversarial attack method on deepfake models, to generate a Cross-Model Universal Adversarial Watermark (CMUA-Watermark) that can protect thousands of facial images from multiple deepfake models. Specifically, we first propose a cross-model universal attack pipeline by attacking multiple deepfake models and combining gradients from these models iteratively. Then we introduce a batch-based method to alleviate the conflict of adversarial watermarks generated by different facial images. Finally, we design a more reasonable and comprehensive evaluation method for evaluating the effectiveness of the adversarial watermark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMUA-Watermark can effectively distort the fake facial images generated by deepfake models and successfully protect facial images from deepfakes in real scenes.\n",
      "There has been a rise in the use of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) Vision APIs as they offer multiple services including pre-built models and algorithms, which otherwise take a huge amount of resources if built from scratch. As these APIs get deployed for high-stakes applications, it's very important that they are robust to different manipulations. Recent works have only focused on typical adversarial attacks when evaluating the robustness of vision APIs. We propose two new aspects of adversarial image generation methods and evaluate them on the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API's optical character recognition service and object detection APIs deployed in real-world settings such as sightengine.com, picpurify.com, Google Cloud Vision API, and Microsoft Azure's Computer Vision API. Specifically, we go beyond the conventional small-noise adversarial attacks and introduce secret embedding and transparent adversarial examples as a simpler way to evaluate robustness. These methods are so straightforward that even non-specialists can craft such attacks. As a result, they pose a serious threat where APIs are used for high-stakes applications. Our transparent adversarial examples successfully evade state-of-the art object detections APIs such as Azure Cloud Vision (attack success rate 52%) and Google Cloud Vision (attack success rate 36%). 90% of the images have a secret embedded text that successfully fools the vision of time-limited humans but is detected by Google Cloud Vision API's optical character recognition. Complementing to current research, our results provide simple but unconventional methods on robustness evaluation.\n",
      "The content based image retrieval aims to find the similar images from a large scale dataset against a query image. Generally, the similarity between the representative features of the query image and dataset images is used to rank the images for retrieval. In early days, various hand designed feature descriptors have been investigated based on the visual cues such as color, texture, shape, etc. that represent the images. However, the deep learning has emerged as a dominating alternative of hand-designed feature engineering from a decade. It learns the features automatically from the data. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of deep learning based developments in the past decade for content based image retrieval. The categorization of existing state-of-the-art methods from different perspectives is also performed for greater understanding of the progress. The taxonomy used in this survey covers different supervision, different networks, different descriptor type and different retrieval type. A performance analysis is also performed using the state-of-the-art methods. The insights are also presented for the benefit of the researchers to observe the progress and to make the best choices. The survey presented in this paper will help in further research progress in image retrieval using deep learning.\n",
      "Person re-identification (re-ID) concerns the matching of subject images across different camera views in a multi camera surveillance system. One of the major challenges in person re-ID is pose variations across the camera network, which significantly affects the appearance of a person. Existing development data lack adequate pose variations to carry out effective training of person re-ID systems. To solve this issue, in this paper we propose an end-to-end pose-driven attention-guided generative adversarial network, to generate multiple poses of a person. We propose to attentively learn and transfer the subject pose through an attention mechanism. A semantic-consistency loss is proposed to preserve the semantic information of the person during pose transfer. To ensure fine image details are realistic after pose translation, an appearance discriminator is used while a pose discriminator is used to ensure the pose of the transferred images will exactly be the same as the target pose. We show that by incorporating the proposed approach in a person re-identification framework, realistic pose transferred images and state-of-the-art re-identification results can be achieved.\n",
      "We consider image completion from the perspective of amortized inference in an image generative model. We leverage recent state of the art variational auto-encoder architectures that have been shown to produce photo-realistic natural images at non-trivial resolutions. Through amortized inference in such a model we can train neural artifacts that produce diverse, realistic image completions even when the vast majority of an image is missing. We demonstrate superior sample quality and diversity compared to prior art on the CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets. We conclude by describing and demonstrating an application that requires an in-painting model with the capabilities ours exhibits: the use of Bayesian optimal experimental design to select the most informative sequence of small field of view x-rays for chest pathology detection.\n",
      "Despite all the challenges and limitations, vision-based vehicle speed detection is gaining research interest due to its great potential benefits such as cost reduction, and enhanced additional functions. As stated in a recent survey [1], the use of learning-based approaches to address this problem is still in its infancy. One of the main difficulties is the need for a large amount of data, which must contain the input sequences and, more importantly, the output values corresponding to the actual speed of the vehicles. Data collection in this context requires a complex and costly setup to capture the images from the camera synchronized with a high precision speed sensor to generate the ground truth speed values. In this paper we explore, for the first time, the use of synthetic images generated from a driving simulator (e.g., CARLA) to address vehicle speed detection using a learning-based approach. We simulate a virtual camera placed over a stretch of road, and generate thousands of images with variability corresponding to multiple speeds, different vehicle types and colors, and lighting and weather conditions. Two different approaches to map the sequence of images to an output speed (regression) are studied, including CNN-GRU and 3D-CNN. We present preliminary results that support the high potential of this approach to address vehicle speed detection.\n",
      "We propose a novel loss for generative models, dubbed as GRaWD (Generative Random Walk Deviation), to improve learning representations of unexplored visual spaces. Quality learning representation of unseen classes (or styles) is crucial to facilitate novel image generation and better generative understanding of unseen visual classes (a.k.a. Zero-Shot Learning, ZSL). By generating representations of unseen classes from their semantic descriptions, such as attributes or text, Generative ZSL aims at identifying unseen categories discriminatively from seen ones. We define GRaWD by constructing a dynamic graph, including the seen class/style centers and generated samples in the current mini-batch. Our loss starts a random walk probability from each center through visual generations produced from hallucinated unseen classes. As a deviation signal, we encourage the random walk to eventually land after t steps in a feature representation that is hard to classify to any of the seen classes. We show that our loss can improve unseen class representation quality on four text-based ZSL benchmarks on CUB and NABirds datasets and three attribute-based ZSL benchmarks on AWA2, SUN, and aPY datasets. We also study our loss's ability to produce meaningful novel visual art generations on WikiArt dataset. Our experiments and human studies show that our loss can improve StyleGAN1 and StyleGAN2 generation quality, creating novel art that is significantly more preferred. Code will be made available.\n",
      "Localized Narratives is a dataset with detailed natural language descriptions of images paired with mouse traces that provide a sparse, fine-grained visual grounding for phrases. We propose TReCS, a sequential model that exploits this grounding to generate images. TReCS uses descriptions to retrieve segmentation masks and predict object labels aligned with mouse traces. These alignments are used to select and position masks to generate a fully covered segmentation canvas; the final image is produced by a segmentation-to-image generator using this canvas. This multi-step, retrieval-based approach outperforms existing direct text-to-image generation models on both automatic metrics and human evaluations: overall, its generated images are more photo-realistic and better match descriptions.\n",
      "The first step toward Seed Phenotyping i.e. the comprehensive assessment of complex seed traits such as growth, development, tolerance, resistance, ecology, yield, and the measurement of pa-rameters that form more complex traits is the identification of seed type. Generally, a plant re-searcher inspects the visual attributes of a seed such as size, shape, area, color and texture to identify the seed type, a process that is tedious and labor-intensive. Advances in the areas of computer vision and deep learning have led to the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN) that aid in classification using images. While they classify efficiently, a key bottleneck is the need for an extensive amount of labelled data to train the CNN before it can be put to the task of classification. The work leverages the concepts of Contrastive Learning and Domain Randomi-zation in order to achieve the same. Briefly, domain randomization is the technique of applying models trained on images containing simulated objects to real-world objects. The use of synthetic images generated from a representational sample crop of real-world images alleviates the need for a large volume of test subjects. As part of the work, synthetic image datasets of five different types of seed images namely, canola, rough rice, sorghum, soy and wheat are applied to three different self-supervised learning frameworks namely, SimCLR, Momentum Contrast (MoCo) and Build Your Own Latent (BYOL) where ResNet-50 is used as the backbone in each of the networks. When the self-supervised models are fine-tuned with only 5% of the labels from the synthetic dataset, results show that MoCo, the model that yields the best performance of the self-supervised learning frameworks in question, achieves an accuracy of 77% on the test dataset which is only ~13% less than the accuracy of 90% achieved by ResNet-50 trained on 100% of the labels.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) advance face synthesis through learning the underlying distribution of observed data. Despite the high-quality generated faces, some minority groups can be rarely generated from the trained models due to a biased image generation process. To study the issue, we first conduct an empirical study on a pre-trained face synthesis model. We observe that after training the GAN model not only carries the biases in the training data but also amplifies them to some degree in the image generation process. To further improve the fairness of image generation, we propose an interpretable baseline method to balance the output facial attributes without retraining. The proposed method shifts the interpretable semantic distribution in the latent space for a more balanced image generation while preserving the sample diversity. Besides producing more balanced data regarding a particular attribute (e.g., race, gender, etc.), our method is generalizable to handle more than one attribute at a time and synthesize samples of fine-grained subgroups. We further show the positive applicability of the balanced data sampled from GANs to quantify the biases in other face recognition systems, like commercial face attribute classifiers and face super-resolution algorithms.\n",
      "In this work, we propose TediGAN, a novel framework for multi-modal image generation and manipulation with textual descriptions. The proposed method consists of three components: StyleGAN inversion module, visual-linguistic similarity learning, and instance-level optimization. The inversion module maps real images to the latent space of a well-trained StyleGAN. The visual-linguistic similarity learns the text-image matching by mapping the image and text into a common embedding space. The instance-level optimization is for identity preservation in manipulation. Our model can produce diverse and high-quality images with an unprecedented resolution at 1024. Using a control mechanism based on style-mixing, our TediGAN inherently supports image synthesis with multi-modal inputs, such as sketches or semantic labels, with or without instance guidance. To facilitate text-guided multi-modal synthesis, we propose the Multi-Modal CelebA-HQ, a large-scale dataset consisting of real face images and corresponding semantic segmentation map, sketch, and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments on the introduced dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. Code and data are available at https://github.com/weihaox/TediGAN.\n",
      "The conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is a powerful tool of generating high-quality images, but existing approaches mostly suffer unsatisfying performance or the risk of mode collapse. This paper presents Omni-GAN, a variant of cGAN that reveals the devil in designing a proper discriminator for training the model. The key is to ensure that the discriminator receives strong supervision to perceive the concepts and moderate regularization to avoid collapse. Omni-GAN is easily implemented and freely integrated with off-the-shelf encoding methods (e.g., implicit neural representation, INR). Experiments validate the superior performance of Omni-GAN and Omni-INR-GAN in a wide range of image generation and restoration tasks. In particular, Omni-INR-GAN sets new records on the ImageNet dataset with impressive Inception scores of 262.85 and 343.22 for the image sizes of 128 and 256, respectively, surpassing the previous records by 100+ points. Moreover, leveraging the generator prior, Omni-INR-GAN can extrapolate low-resolution images to arbitrary resolution, even up to x60+ higher resolution. Code is available.\n",
      "The recently introduced introspective variational autoencoder (IntroVAE) exhibits outstanding image generations, and allows for amortized inference using an image encoder. The main idea in IntroVAE is to train a VAE adversarially, using the VAE encoder to discriminate between generated and real data samples. However, the original IntroVAE loss function relied on a particular hinge-loss formulation that is very hard to stabilize in practice, and its theoretical convergence analysis ignored important terms in the loss. In this work, we take a step towards better understanding of the IntroVAE model, its practical implementation, and its applications. We propose the Soft-IntroVAE, a modified IntroVAE that replaces the hinge-loss terms with a smooth exponential loss on generated samples. This change significantly improves training stability, and also enables theoretical analysis of the complete algorithm. Interestingly, we show that the IntroVAE converges to a distribution that minimizes a sum of KL distance from the data distribution and an entropy term. We discuss the implications of this result, and demonstrate that it induces competitive image generation and reconstruction. Finally, we describe two applications of Soft-IntroVAE to unsupervised image translation and out-of-distribution detection, and demonstrate compelling results. Code and additional information is available on the project website -- https://taldatech.github.io/soft-intro-vae-web\n",
      "How to improve generative modeling by better exploiting spatial regularities and coherence in images? We introduce a novel neural network for building image generators (decoders) and apply it to variational autoencoders (VAEs). In our spatial dependency networks (SDNs), feature maps at each level of a deep neural net are computed in a spatially coherent way, using a sequential gating-based mechanism that distributes contextual information across 2-D space. We show that augmenting the decoder of a hierarchical VAE by spatial dependency layers considerably improves density estimation over baseline convolutional architectures and the state-of-the-art among the models within the same class. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SDN can be applied to large images by synthesizing samples of high quality and coherence. In a vanilla VAE setting, we find that a powerful SDN decoder also improves learning disentangled representations, indicating that neural architectures play an important role in this task. Our results suggest favoring spatial dependency over convolutional layers in various VAE settings. The accompanying source code is given at https://github.com/djordjemila/sdn.\n",
      "Although highly accurate automated diagnostic techniques for melanoma have been reported, the realization of a system capable of providing diagnostic evidence based on medical indices remains an open issue because of difficulties in obtaining reliable training data. In this paper, we propose bulk production augmentation (BPA) to generate high-quality, diverse pseudo-skin tumor images with the desired structural malignant features for additional training images from a limited number of labeled images. The proposed BPA acts as an effective data augmentation in constructing the feature detector for the atypical pigment network (APN), which is a key structure in melanoma diagnosis. Experiments show that training with images generated by our BPA largely boosts the APN detection performance by 20.0 percentage points in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which is 11.5 to 13.7 points higher than that of conventional CycleGAN-based augmentations in AUC.\n",
      "We present Sandwich Batch Normalization (SaBN), an embarrassingly easy improvement of Batch Normalization (BN) with only a few lines of code changes. SaBN is motivated by addressing the inherent feature distribution heterogeneity that one can be identified in many tasks, which can arise from data heterogeneity (multiple input domains) or model heterogeneity (dynamic architectures, model conditioning, etc.). Our SaBN factorizes the BN affine layer into one shared sandwich affine layer, cascaded by several parallel independent affine layers. Concrete analysis reveals that, during optimization, SaBN promotes balanced gradient norms while still preserving diverse gradient directions: a property that many application tasks seem to favor. We demonstrate the prevailing effectiveness of SaBN as a drop-in replacement in four tasks: $\\textbf{conditional image generation}$, $\\textbf{neural architecture search}$ (NAS), $\\textbf{adversarial training}$, and $\\textbf{arbitrary style transfer}$. Leveraging SaBN immediately achieves better Inception Score and FID on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet conditional image generation with three state-of-the-art GANs; boosts the performance of a state-of-the-art weight-sharing NAS algorithm significantly on NAS-Bench-201; substantially improves the robust and standard accuracies for adversarial defense; and produces superior arbitrary stylized results. We also provide visualizations and analysis to help understand why SaBN works. Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Sandwich-Batch-Normalization.\n",
      "Convolutional neural networks are able to learn realistic image priors from numerous training samples in low-level image generation and restoration. We show that, for high-level image recognition tasks, we can further reconstruct \"realistic\" images of each category by leveraging intrinsic Batch Normalization (BN) statistics without any training data. Inspired by the popular VAE/GAN methods, we regard the zero-shot optimization process of synthetic images as generative modeling to match the distribution of BN statistics. The generated images serve as a calibration set for the following zero-shot network quantizations. Our method meets the needs for quantizing models based on sensitive information, \\textit{e.g.,} due to privacy concerns, no data is available. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that, with the help of generated data, our approach consistently outperforms existing data-free quantization methods.\n",
      "Discrete latent spaces in variational autoencoders have been shown to effectively capture the data distribution for many real-world problems such as natural language understanding, human intent prediction, and visual scene representation. However, discrete latent spaces need to be sufficiently large to capture the complexities of real-world data, rendering downstream tasks computationally challenging. For instance, performing motion planning in a high-dimensional latent representation of the environment could be intractable. We consider the problem of sparsifying the discrete latent space of a trained conditional variational autoencoder, while preserving its learned multimodality. As a post hoc latent space reduction technique, we use evidential theory to identify the latent classes that receive direct evidence from a particular input condition and filter out those that do not. Experiments on diverse tasks, such as image generation and human behavior prediction, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique at reducing the discrete latent sample space size of a model while maintaining its learned multimodality.\n",
      "To detect bias in face recognition networks, it can be useful to probe a network under test using samples in which only specific attributes vary in some controlled way. However, capturing a sufficiently large dataset with specific control over the attributes of interest is difficult. In this work, we describe a simulator that applies specific head pose and facial expression adjustments to images of previously unseen people. The simulator first fits a 3D morphable model to a provided image, applies the desired head pose and facial expression controls, then renders the model into an image. Next, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) conditioned on the original image and the rendered morphable model is used to produce the image of the original person with the new facial expression and head pose. We call this conditional GAN -- MorphGAN. Images generated using MorphGAN conserve the identity of the person in the original image, and the provided control over head pose and facial expression allows test sets to be created to identify robustness issues of a facial recognition deep network with respect to pose and expression. Images generated by MorphGAN can also serve as data augmentation when training data are scarce. We show that by augmenting small datasets of faces with new poses and expressions improves the recognition performance by up to 9% depending on the augmentation and data scarcity.\n",
      "Existing image generator networks rely heavily on spatial convolutions and, optionally, self-attention blocks in order to gradually synthesize images in a coarse-to-fine manner. Here, we present a new architecture for image generators, where the color value at each pixel is computed independently given the value of a random latent vector and the coordinate of that pixel. No spatial convolutions or similar operations that propagate information across pixels are involved during the synthesis. We analyze the modeling capabilities of such generators when trained in an adversarial fashion, and observe the new generators to achieve similar generation quality to state-of-the-art convolutional generators. We also investigate several interesting properties unique to the new architecture.\n",
      "Semantic editing on segmentation map has been proposed as an intermediate interface for image generation, because it provides flexible and strong assistance in various image generation tasks. This paper aims to improve quality of edited segmentation map conditioned on semantic inputs. Even though recent studies apply global and local adversarial losses extensively to generate images for higher image quality, we find that they suffer from the misalignment of the boundary area in the mask area. To address this, we propose MExGAN for semantic editing on segmentation map, which uses a novel Multi-Expansion (MEx) loss implemented by adversarial losses on MEx areas. Each MEx area has the mask area of the generation as the majority and the boundary of original context as the minority. To boost convenience and stability of MEx loss, we further propose an Approximated MEx (A-MEx) loss. Besides, in contrast to previous model that builds training data for semantic editing on segmentation map with part of the whole image, which leads to model performance degradation, MExGAN applies the whole image to build the training data. Extensive experiments on semantic editing on segmentation map and natural image inpainting show competitive results on four datasets.\n",
      "In game development, designing compelling visual assets that convey gameplay-relevant features requires time and experience. Recent image generation methods that create high-quality content could reduce development costs, but these approaches do not consider game mechanics. We propose a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) system to modify and generate new game visuals based on their gameplay relevance. We test this approach with Pok\\'emon sprites and Pok\\'emon type information, since types are one of the game's core mechanics and they directly impact the game's visuals. Our experimental results indicate that adopting a transfer learning approach can help to improve visual quality and stability over unseen data.\n",
      "Mirroring the success of masked language models, vision-and-language counterparts like ViLBERT, LXMERT and UNITER have achieved state of the art performance on a variety of multimodal discriminative tasks like visual question answering and visual grounding. Recent work has also successfully adapted such models towards the generative task of image captioning. This begs the question: Can these models go the other way and generate images from pieces of text? Our analysis of a popular representative from this model family - LXMERT - finds that it is unable to generate rich and semantically meaningful imagery with its current training setup. We introduce X-LXMERT, an extension to LXMERT with training refinements including: discretizing visual representations, using uniform masking with a large range of masking ratios and aligning the right pre-training datasets to the right objectives which enables it to paint. X-LXMERT's image generation capabilities rival state of the art generative models while its question answering and captioning abilities remains comparable to LXMERT. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of these training refinements by adding image generation capabilities into UNITER to produce X-UNITER.\n",
      "Conditional image generation (CIG) is a widely studied problem in computer vision and machine learning. Given a class, CIG takes the name of this class as input and generates a set of images that belong to this class. In existing CIG works, for different classes, their corresponding images are generated independently, without considering the relationship among classes. In real-world applications, the classes are organized into a hierarchy and their hierarchical relationships are informative for generating high-fidelity images. In this paper, we aim to leverage the class hierarchy for conditional image generation. We propose two ways of incorporating class hierarchy: prior control and post constraint. In prior control, we first encode the class hierarchy, then feed it as a prior into the conditional generator to generate images. In post constraint, after the images are generated, we measure their consistency with the class hierarchy and use the consistency score to guide the training of the generator. Based on these two ideas, we propose a TreeGAN model which consists of three modules: (1) a class hierarchy encoder (CHE) which takes the hierarchical structure of classes and their textual names as inputs and learns an embedding for each class; the embedding captures the hierarchical relationship among classes; (2) a conditional image generator (CIG) which takes the CHE-generated embedding of a class as input and generates a set of images belonging to this class; (3) a consistency checker which performs hierarchical classification on the generated images and checks whether the generated images are compatible with the class hierarchy; the consistency score is used to guide the CIG to generate hierarchy-compatible images. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\n",
      "Most existing text-to-image synthesis tasks are static single-turn generation, based on pre-defined textual descriptions of images. To explore more practical and interactive real-life applications, we introduce a new task - Interactive Image Editing, where users can guide an agent to edit images via multi-turn textual commands on-the-fly. In each session, the agent takes a natural language description from the user as the input and modifies the image generated in the previous turn to a new design, following the user description. The main challenges in this sequential and interactive image generation task are two-fold: 1) contextual consistency between a generated image and the provided textual description; 2) step-by-step region-level modification to maintain visual consistency across the generated image sequence in each session. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Sequential Attention Generative Adversarial Net-work (SeqAttnGAN), which applies a neural state tracker to encode the previous image and the textual description in each turn of the sequence, and uses a GAN framework to generate a modified version of the image that is consistent with the preceding images and coherent with the description. To achieve better region-specific refinement, we also introduce a sequential attention mechanism into the model. To benchmark on the new task, we introduce two new datasets, Zap-Seq and DeepFashion-Seq, which contain multi-turn sessions with image-description sequences in the fashion domain. Experiments on both datasets show that the proposed SeqAttnGANmodel outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the interactive image editing task across all evaluation metrics including visual quality, image sequence coherence, and text-image consistency.\n",
      "Generating an image from a provided descriptive text is quite a challenging task because of the difficulty in incorporating perceptual information (object shapes, colors, and their interactions) along with providing high relevancy related to the provided text. Current methods first generate an initial low-resolution image, which typically has irregular object shapes, colors, and interaction between objects. This initial image is then improved by conditioning on the text. However, these methods mainly address the problem of using text representation efficiently in the refinement of the initially generated image, while the success of this refinement process depends heavily on the quality of the initially generated image, as pointed out in the DM-GAN paper. Hence, we propose a method to provide good initialized images by incorporating perceptual understanding in the discriminator module. We improve the perceptual information at the first stage itself, which results in significant improvement in the final generated image. In this paper, we have applied our approach to the novel StackGAN architecture. We then show that the perceptual information included in the initial image is improved while modeling image distribution at multiple stages. Finally, we generated realistic multi-colored images conditioned by text. These images have good quality along with containing improved basic perceptual information. More importantly, the proposed method can be integrated into the pipeline of other state-of-the-art text-based-image-generation models to generate initial low-resolution images. We also worked on improving the refinement process in StackGAN by augmenting the third stage of the generator-discriminator pair in the StackGAN architecture. Our experimental analysis and comparison with the state-of-the-art on a large but sparse dataset MS COCO further validate the usefulness of our proposed approach.\n",
      "Pose-guided person image generation is to transform a source person image to a target pose. This task requires spatial manipulations of source data. However, Convolutional Neural Networks are limited by the lack of ability to spatially transform the inputs. In this paper, we propose a differentiable global-flow local-attention framework to reassemble the inputs at the feature level. Specifically, our model first calculates the global correlations between sources and targets to predict flow fields. Then, the flowed local patch pairs are extracted from the feature maps to calculate the local attention coefficients. Finally, we warp the source features using a content-aware sampling method with the obtained local attention coefficients. The results of both subjective and objective experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model. Besides, additional results in video animation and view synthesis show that our model is applicable to other tasks requiring spatial transformation. Our source code is available at https://github.com/RenYurui/Global-Flow-Local-Attention.\n",
      "Over the past few years many research efforts have been devoted to the field of affect analysis. Various approaches have been proposed for: i) discrete emotion recognition in terms of the primary facial expressions; ii) emotion analysis in terms of facial Action Units (AUs), assuming a fixed expression intensity; iii) dimensional emotion analysis, in terms of valence and arousal (VA). These approaches can only be effective, if they are developed using large, appropriately annotated databases, showing behaviors of people in-the-wild, i.e., in uncontrolled environments. Aff-Wild has been the first, large-scale, in-the-wild database (including around 1,200,000 frames of 300 videos), annotated in terms of VA. In the vast majority of existing emotion databases, their annotation is limited to either primary expressions, or valence-arousal, or action units. In this paper, we first annotate a part (around $234,000$ frames) of the Aff-Wild database in terms of $8$ AUs and another part (around $288,000$ frames) in terms of the $7$ basic emotion categories, so that parts of this database are annotated in terms of VA, as well as AUs, or primary expressions. Then, we set up and tackle multi-task learning for emotion recognition, as well as for facial image generation. Multi-task learning is performed using: i) a deep neural network with shared hidden layers, which learns emotional attributes by exploiting their inter-dependencies; ii) a discriminator of a generative adversarial network (GAN). On the other hand, image generation is implemented through the generator of the GAN. For these two tasks, we carefully design loss functions that fit the examined set-up. Experiments are presented which illustrate the good performance of the proposed approach when applied to the new annotated parts of the Aff-Wild database.\n",
      "There is a growing interest in using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce image content that is indistinguishable from real images as judged by a typical person. A number of GAN variants for this purpose have been proposed, however, evaluating GANs performance is inherently difficult because current methods for measuring the quality of their output are not always consistent with what a human perceives. We propose a novel approach that combines a brain-computer interface (BCI) with GANs to generate a measure we call Neuroscore, which closely mirrors the behavioral ground truth measured from participants tasked with discerning real from synthetic images. This technique we call a neuro-AI interface, as it provides an interface between a human's neural systems and an AI process. In this paper, we first compare the three most widely used metrics in the literature for evaluating GANs in terms of visual quality and compare their outputs with human judgments. Secondly we propose and demonstrate a novel approach using neural signals and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) that directly measures a human perceptual response to facial production quality, independent of a behavioral response measurement. The correlation between our proposed Neuroscore and human perceptual judgments has Pearson correlation statistics: $\\mathrm{r}(48) = -0.767, \\mathrm{p} = 2.089e-10$. We also present the bootstrap result for the correlation i.e., $\\mathrm{p}\\leq 0.0001$. Results show that our Neuroscore is more consistent with human judgment compared to the conventional metrics we evaluated. We conclude that neural signals have potential applications for high quality, rapid evaluation of GANs in the context of visual image synthesis.\n",
      "Discovering and exploiting the causality in deep neural networks (DNNs) are crucial challenges for understanding and reasoning causal effects (CE) on an explainable visual model. \"Intervention\" has been widely used for recognizing a causal relation ontologically. In this paper, we propose a causal inference framework for visual reasoning via do-calculus. To study the intervention effects on pixel-level features for causal reasoning, we introduce pixel-wise masking and adversarial perturbation. In our framework, CE is calculated using features in a latent space and perturbed prediction from a DNN-based model. We further provide the first look into the characteristics of discovered CE of adversarially perturbed images generated by gradient-based methods \\footnote{~~https://github.com/jjaacckkyy63/Causal-Intervention-AE-wAdvImg}. Experimental results show that CE is a competitive and robust index for understanding DNNs when compared with conventional methods such as class-activation mappings (CAMs) on the Chest X-Ray-14 dataset for human-interpretable feature(s) (e.g., symptom) reasoning. Moreover, CE holds promises for detecting adversarial examples as it possesses distinct characteristics in the presence of adversarial perturbations.\n",
      "Recent progress in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has shown promising signs of improving GAN training via architectural change. Despite some early success, at present the design of GAN architectures requires human expertise, laborious trial-and-error testings, and often draws inspiration from its image classification counterpart. In the current paper, we present the first neural architecture search algorithm, automated neural architecture search for deep generative models, or AGAN for abbreviation, that is specifically suited for GAN training. For unsupervised image generation tasks on CIFAR-10, our algorithm finds architecture that outperforms state-of-the-art models under same regularization techniques. For supervised tasks, the automatically searched architectures also achieve highly competitive performance, outperforming best human-invented architectures at resolution $32\\times32$. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that the modules learned by AGAN are transferable to other image generation tasks such as STL-10.\n",
      "Recent years have witnessed some exciting developments in the domain of generating images from scene-based text descriptions. These approaches have primarily focused on generating images from a static text description and are limited to generating images in a single pass. They are unable to generate an image interactively based on an incrementally additive text description (something that is more intuitive and similar to the way we describe an image). We propose a method to generate an image incrementally based on a sequence of graphs of scene descriptions (scene-graphs). We propose a recurrent network architecture that preserves the image content generated in previous steps and modifies the cumulative image as per the newly provided scene information. Our model utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to cater to variable-sized scene graphs along with Generative Adversarial image translation networks to generate realistic multi-object images without needing any intermediate supervision during training. We experiment with Coco-Stuff dataset which has multi-object images along with annotations describing the visual scene and show that our model significantly outperforms other approaches on the same dataset in generating visually consistent images for incrementally growing scene graphs.\n",
      "We study two important concepts in adversarial deep learning---adversarial training and generative adversarial network (GAN). Adversarial training is the technique used to improve the robustness of discriminator by combining adversarial attacker and discriminator in the training phase. GAN is commonly used for image generation by jointly optimizing discriminator and generator. We show these two concepts are indeed closely related and can be used to strengthen each other---adding a generator to the adversarial training procedure can improve the robustness of discriminators, and adding an adversarial attack to GAN training can improve the convergence speed and lead to better generators. Combining these two insights, we develop a framework called Rob-GAN to jointly optimize generator and discriminator in the presence of adversarial attacks---the generator generates fake images to fool discriminator; the adversarial attacker perturbs real images to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator wants to minimize loss under fake and adversarial images. Through this end-to-end training procedure, we are able to simultaneously improve the convergence speed of GAN training, the quality of synthetic images, and the robustness of discriminator under strong adversarial attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the obtained classifier is more robust than the state-of-the-art adversarial training approach, and the generator outperforms SN-GAN on ImageNet-143.\n",
      "Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) have led to large improvements in the task of conditional image generation, which lies at the heart of computer vision. The major focus so far has been on performance improvement, while there has been little effort in making cGAN more robust to noise. The regression (of the generator) might lead to arbitrarily large errors in the output, which makes cGAN unreliable for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a novel conditional GAN model, called RoCGAN, which leverages structure in the target space of the model to address the issue. Our model augments the generator with an unsupervised pathway, which promotes the outputs of the generator to span the target manifold even in the presence of intense noise. We prove that RoCGAN share similar theoretical properties as GAN and experimentally verify that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art cGAN architectures by a large margin in a variety of domains including images from natural scenes and faces.\n",
      "Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is an asymptomatic retinal disease which may result in loss of vision. There is limited access to high-quality relevant retinal images and poor understanding of the features defining sub-classes of this disease. Motivated by recent advances in machine learning we specifically explore the potential of generative modeling, using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and style transferring, to facilitate clinical diagnosis and disease understanding by feature extraction. We design an analytic pipeline which first generates synthetic retinal images from clinical images; a subsequent verification step is applied. In the synthesizing step we merge GANs (DCGANs and WGANs architectures) and style transferring for the image generation, whereas the verified step controls the accuracy of the generated images. We find that the generated images contain sufficient pathological details to facilitate ophthalmologists' task of disease classification and in discovery of disease relevant features. In particular, our system predicts the drusen and geographic atrophy sub-classes of AMD. Furthermore, the performance using CFP images for GANs outperforms the classification based on using only the original clinical dataset. Our results are evaluated using existing classifier of retinal diseases and class activated maps, supporting the predictive power of the synthetic images and their utility for feature extraction. Our code examples are available online.\n",
      "We describe TF-Replicator, a framework for distributed machine learning designed for DeepMind researchers and implemented as an abstraction over TensorFlow. TF-Replicator simplifies writing data-parallel and model-parallel research code. The same models can be effortlessly deployed to different cluster architectures (i.e. one or many machines containing CPUs, GPUs or TPU accelerators) using synchronous or asynchronous training regimes. To demonstrate the generality and scalability of TF-Replicator, we implement and benchmark three very different models: (1) A ResNet-50 for ImageNet classification, (2) a SN-GAN for class-conditional ImageNet image generation, and (3) a D4PG reinforcement learning agent for continuous control. Our results show strong scalability performance without demanding any distributed systems expertise of the user. The TF-Replicator programming model will be open-sourced as part of TensorFlow 2.0 (see https://github.com/tensorflow/community/pull/25).\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) receive great attentions recently due to its excellent performance in image generation, transformation, and super-resolution. However, GAN has rarely been studied and trained for classification, leading that the generated images may not be appropriate for classification. In this paper, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Classifier (GAC) particularly for low-resolution Handwriting Character Recognition. Specifically, involving additionally a classifier in the training process of normal GANs, GAC is calibrated for learning suitable structures and restored characters images that benefits the classification. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve remarkable performance in handwriting characters 8x super-resolution, approximately 10% and 20% higher than the present state-of-the-art methods respectively on benchmark data CASIA-HWDB1.1 and MNIST.\n",
      "Which generative model is the most suitable for Continual Learning? This paper aims at evaluating and comparing generative models on disjoint sequential image generation tasks. We investigate how several models learn and forget, considering various strategies: rehearsal, regularization, generative replay and fine-tuning. We used two quantitative metrics to estimate the generation quality and memory ability. We experiment with sequential tasks on three commonly used benchmarks for Continual Learning (MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10). We found that among all models, the original GAN performs best and among Continual Learning strategies, generative replay outperforms all other methods. Even if we found satisfactory combinations on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, training generative models sequentially on CIFAR10 is particularly instable, and remains a challenge. Our code is available online \\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/TLESORT/Generative\\_Continual\\_Learning}}.\n",
      "The extension of image generation to video generation turns out to be a very difficult task, since the temporal dimension of videos introduces an extra challenge during the generation process. Besides, due to the limitation of memory and training stability, the generation becomes increasingly challenging with the increase of the resolution/duration of videos. In this work, we exploit the idea of progressive growing of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for higher resolution video generation. In particular, we begin to produce video samples of low-resolution and short-duration, and then progressively increase both resolution and duration alone (or jointly) by adding new spatiotemporal convolutional layers to the current networks. Starting from the learning on a very raw-level spatial appearance and temporal movement of the video distribution, the proposed progressive method learns spatiotemporal information incrementally to generate higher resolution videos. Furthermore, we introduce a sliced version of Wasserstein GAN (SWGAN) loss to improve the distribution learning on the video data of high-dimension and mixed-spatiotemporal distribution. SWGAN loss replaces the distance between joint distributions by that of one-dimensional marginal distributions, making the loss easier to compute. We evaluate the proposed model on our collected face video dataset of 10,900 videos to generate photorealistic face videos of 256x256x32 resolution. In addition, our model also reaches a record inception score of 14.57 in unsupervised action recognition dataset UCF-101.\n",
      "Generating large quantities of quality labeled data in medical imaging is very time consuming and expensive. The performance of supervised algorithms for various tasks on imaging has improved drastically over the years, however the availability of data to train these algorithms have become one of the main bottlenecks for implementation. To address this, we propose a semi-supervised learning method where pseudo-negative labels from unlabeled data are used to further refine the performance of a pulmonary nodule detection network in chest radiographs. After training with the proposed network, the false positive rate was reduced to 0.1266 from 0.4864 while maintaining sensitivity at 0.89.\n",
      "In this paper we introduce Curriculum GANs, a curriculum learning strategy for training Generative Adversarial Networks that increases the strength of the discriminator over the course of training, thereby making the learning task progressively more difficult for the generator. We demonstrate that this strategy is key to obtaining state-of-the-art results in image generation. We also show evidence that this strategy may be broadly applicable to improving GAN training in other data modalities.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) provide impressive image generations from Gaussian white noise, but the underlying mathematics are not well understood. We compute deep convolutional network generators by inverting a fixed embedding operator. Therefore, they do not require to be optimized with a discriminator or an encoder. The embedding is Lipschitz continuous to deformations so that generators transform linear interpolations between input white noise vectors into deformations between output images. This embedding is computed with a wavelet Scattering transform. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting Scattering generators have similar properties as GANs or VAEs, without learning a discriminative network or an encoder.\n",
      "Person Re-identification (re-id) faces two major challenges: the lack of cross-view paired training data and learning discriminative identity-sensitive and view-invariant features in the presence of large pose variations. In this work, we address both problems by proposing a novel deep person image generation model for synthesizing realistic person images conditional on the pose. The model is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) designed specifically for pose normalization in re-id, thus termed pose-normalization GAN (PN-GAN). With the synthesized images, we can learn a new type of deep re-id feature free of the influence of pose variations. We show that this feature is strong on its own and complementary to features learned with the original images. Importantly, under the transfer learning setting, we show that our model generalizes well to any new re-id dataset without the need for collecting any training data for model fine-tuning. The model thus has the potential to make re-id model truly scalable.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose the Cross-Domain Adversarial Auto-Encoder (CDAAE) to address the problem of cross-domain image inference, generation and transformation. We make the assumption that images from different domains share the same latent code space for content, while having separate latent code space for style. The proposed framework can map cross-domain data to a latent code vector consisting of a content part and a style part. The latent code vector is matched with a prior distribution so that we can generate meaningful samples from any part of the prior space. Consequently, given a sample of one domain, our framework can generate various samples of the other domain with the same content of the input. This makes the proposed framework different from the current work of cross-domain transformation. Besides, the proposed framework can be trained with both labeled and unlabeled data, which makes it also suitable for domain adaptation. Experimental results on data sets SVHN, MNIST and CASIA show the proposed framework achieved visually appealing performance for image generation task. Besides, we also demonstrate the proposed method achieved superior results for domain adaptation. Code of our experiments is available in https://github.com/luckycallor/CDAAE.\n",
      "Generative models have made significant progress in the tasks of modeling complex data distributions such as natural images. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and auto-encoders lead to the possibility of training on big data sets in an unsupervised manner. However, for many generative models it is not possible to specify what kind of image should be generated and it is not possible to translate existing images into new images of similar domains. Furthermore, models that can perform image-to-image translation often need distinct models for each domain, making it hard to scale these systems to multiple domain image-to-image translation. We introduce a model that can do both, controllable image generation and image-to-image translation between multiple domains. We split our image representation into two parts encoding unstructured and structured information respectively. The latter is designed in a disentangled manner, so that different parts encode different image characteristics. We train an encoder to encode images into these representations and use a small amount of labeled data to specify what kind of information should be encoded in the disentangled part. A generator is trained to generate images from these representations using the characteristics provided by the disentangled part of the representation. Through this we can control what kind of images the generator generates, translate images between different domains, and even learn unknown data-generating factors while only using one single model.\n",
      "Neural text generation models are often autoregressive language models or seq2seq models. These models generate text by sampling words sequentially, with each word conditioned on the previous word, and are state-of-the-art for several machine translation and summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks are often defined by validation perplexity even though this is not a direct measure of the quality of the generated text. Additionally, these models are typically trained via maxi- mum likelihood and teacher forcing. These methods are well-suited to optimizing perplexity but can result in poor sample quality since generating text requires conditioning on sequences of words that may have never been observed at training time. We propose to improve sample quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which explicitly train the generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in image generation. GANs were originally designed to output differentiable values, so discrete language generation is challenging for them. We claim that validation perplexity alone is not indicative of the quality of text generated by a model. We introduce an actor-critic conditional GAN that fills in missing text conditioned on the surrounding context. We show qualitatively and quantitatively, evidence that this produces more realistic conditional and unconditional text samples compared to a maximum likelihood trained model.\n",
      "Compatibility between items, such as clothes and shoes, is a major factor among customer's purchasing decisions. However, learning \"compatibility\" is challenging due to (1) broader notions of compatibility than those of similarity, (2) the asymmetric nature of compatibility, and (3) only a small set of compatible and incompatible items are observed. We propose an end-to-end trainable system to embed each item into a latent vector and project a query item into K compatible prototypes in the same space. These prototypes reflect the broad notions of compatibility. We refer to both the embedding and prototypes as \"Compatibility Family\". In our learned space, we introduce a novel Projected Compatibility Distance (PCD) function which is differentiable and ensures diversity by aiming for at least one prototype to be close to a compatible item, whereas none of the prototypes are close to an incompatible item. We evaluate our system on a toy dataset, two Amazon product datasets, and Polyvore outfit dataset. Our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we show that we can visualize the candidate compatible prototypes using a Metric-regularized Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (MrCGAN), where the input is a projected prototype and the output is a generated image of a compatible item. We ask human evaluators to judge the relative compatibility between our generated images and images generated by CGANs conditioned directly on query items. Our generated images are significantly preferred, with roughly twice the number of votes as others.\n",
      "Recent research has demonstrated the ability to estimate gaze on mobile devices by performing inference on the image from the phone's front-facing camera, and without requiring specialized hardware. While this offers wide potential applications such as in human-computer interaction, medical diagnosis and accessibility (e.g., hands free gaze as input for patients with motor disorders), current methods are limited as they rely on collecting data from real users, which is a tedious and expensive process that is hard to scale across devices. There have been some attempts to synthesize eye region data using 3D models that can simulate various head poses and camera settings, however these lack in realism.   In this paper, we improve upon a recently suggested method, and propose a generative adversarial framework to generate a large dataset of high resolution colorful images with high diversity (e.g., in subjects, head pose, camera settings) and realism, while simultaneously preserving the accuracy of gaze labels. The proposed approach operates on extended regions of the eye, and even completes missing parts of the image. Using this rich synthesized dataset, and without using any additional training data from real users, we demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art for estimating 2D gaze position on mobile devices. We further demonstrate cross-device generalization of model performance, as well as improved robustness to diverse head pose, blur and distance.\n",
      "We present a framework to systematically analyze convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in classification of cars in autonomous vehicles. Our analysis procedure comprises an image generator that produces synthetic pictures by sampling in a lower dimension image modification subspace and a suite of visualization tools. The image generator produces images which can be used to test the CNN and hence expose its vulnerabilities. The presented framework can be used to extract insights of the CNN classifier, compare across classification models, or generate training and validation datasets.\n",
      "Communicating and sharing intelligence among agents is an important facet of achieving Artificial General Intelligence. As a first step towards this challenge, we introduce a novel framework for image generation: Message Passing Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Networks (MPM GANs). While GANs have recently been shown to be very effective for image generation and other tasks, these networks have been limited to mostly single generator-discriminator networks. We show that we can obtain multi-agent GANs that communicate through message passing to achieve better image generation. The objectives of the individual agents in this framework are two fold: a co-operation objective and a competing objective. The co-operation objective ensures that the message sharing mechanism guides the other generator to generate better than itself while the competing objective encourages each generator to generate better than its counterpart. We analyze and visualize the messages that these GANs share among themselves in various scenarios. We quantitatively show that the message sharing formulation serves as a regularizer for the adversarial training. Qualitatively, we show that the different generators capture different traits of the underlying data distribution.\n",
      "We present an image-conditional image generation model. The model transfers an input domain to a target domain in semantic level, and generates the target image in pixel level. To generate realistic target images, we employ the real/fake-discriminator as in Generative Adversarial Nets, but also introduce a novel domain-discriminator to make the generated image relevant to the input image. We verify our model through a challenging task of generating a piece of clothing from an input image of a dressed person. We present a high quality clothing dataset containing the two domains, and succeed in demonstrating decent results.\n",
      "This paper investigates a novel problem of generating images from visual attributes. We model the image as a composite of foreground and background and develop a layered generative model with disentangled latent variables that can be learned end-to-end using a variational auto-encoder. We experiment with natural images of faces and birds and demonstrate that the proposed models are capable of generating realistic and diverse samples with disentangled latent representations. We use a general energy minimization algorithm for posterior inference of latent variables given novel images. Therefore, the learned generative models show excellent quantitative and visual results in the tasks of attribute-conditioned image reconstruction and completion.\n",
      "Humans have an impressive ability to reason about new concepts and experiences from just a single example. In particular, humans have an ability for one-shot generalization: an ability to encounter a new concept, understand its structure, and then be able to generate compelling alternative variations of the concept. We develop machine learning systems with this important capacity by developing new deep generative models, models that combine the representational power of deep learning with the inferential power of Bayesian reasoning. We develop a class of sequential generative models that are built on the principles of feedback and attention. These two characteristics lead to generative models that are among the state-of-the art in density estimation and image generation. We demonstrate the one-shot generalization ability of our models using three tasks: unconditional sampling, generating new exemplars of a given concept, and generating new exemplars of a family of concepts. In all cases our models are able to generate compelling and diverse samples---having seen new examples just once---providing an important class of general-purpose models for one-shot machine learning.\n",
      "This paper presents Pix2Seq, a simple and generic framework for object detection. Unlike existing approaches that explicitly integrate prior knowledge about the task, we simply cast object detection as a language modeling task conditioned on the observed pixel inputs. Object descriptions (e.g., bounding boxes and class labels) are expressed as sequences of discrete tokens, and we train a neural net to perceive the image and generate the desired sequence. Our approach is based mainly on the intuition that if a neural net knows about where and what the objects are, we just need to teach it how to read them out. Beyond the use of task-specific data augmentations, our approach makes minimal assumptions about the task, yet it achieves competitive results on the challenging COCO dataset, compared to highly specialized and well optimized detection algorithms.\n",
      "Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision. While approaches for axis-aligned bounding box detection have made substantial progress in recent years, they perform poorly on oriented objects which are common in several real-world scenarios such as aerial view imagery and security camera footage. In these cases, a large part of a predicted bounding box will, undesirably, cover non-object related areas. Therefore, oriented object detection has emerged with the aim of generalizing object detection to arbitrary orientations. This enables a tighter fit to oriented objects, leading to a better separation of bounding boxes especially in case of dense object distributions. The vast majority of the work in this area has focused on complex two-stage anchor-based approaches. Anchors act as priors on the bounding box shape and require attentive hyper-parameter fine-tuning on a per-dataset basis, increased model size, and come with computational overhead. In this work, we present DAFNe: A Dense one-stage Anchor-Free deep Network for oriented object detection. As a one-stage model, DAFNe performs predictions on a dense grid over the input image, being architecturally simpler and faster, as well as easier to optimize than its two-stage counterparts. Furthermore, as an anchor-free model, DAFNe reduces the prediction complexity by refraining from employing bounding box anchors. Moreover, we introduce an orientation-aware generalization of the center-ness function for arbitrarily oriented bounding boxes to down-weight low-quality predictions and a center-to-corner bounding box prediction strategy that improves object localization performance. DAFNe improves the prediction accuracy over the previous best one-stage anchor-free model results on DOTA 1.0 by 4.65% mAP, setting the new state-of-the-art results by achieving 76.95% mAP.\n",
      "In this paper, we present an efficient and high-performance neural architecture, termed Point-Voxel Transformer (PVT)for 3D deep learning, which deeply integrates both 3D voxel-based and point-based self-attention computation to learn more discriminative features from 3D data. Specifically, we conduct multi-head self-attention (MSA) computation in voxels to obtain the efficient learning pattern and the coarse-grained local features while performing self-attention in points to provide finer-grained information about the global context. In addition, to reduce the cost of MSA computation with high efficiency, we design a cyclic shifted boxing scheme by limiting the MSA computation to non-overlapping local box and also preserving cross-box connection. Evaluated on classification benchmark, our method not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.0% (no voting) but outperforms previous Transformer-based models with 7x measured speedup on average. On part and semantic segmentation, our model also obtains strong performance(86.5% and 68.2% mIoU, respectively). For 3D object detection task, we replace the primitives in Frustrum PointNet with PVT block and achieve an improvement of 8.6% AP.\n",
      "Rotated object detection is a challenging task in aerial images as the object in aerial images are displayed in arbitrary directions and usually densely packed. Although considerable progress has been made, there are still challenges that existing regression-based rotation detectors suffer the problem of discontinuous boundaries, which is directly caused by angular periodicity or corner ordering. In this paper, we propose a simple effective framework to address the above challenges. Instead of directly regressing the five parameters (coordinates of the central point, width, height, and rotation angle) or the four vertices, we use the area ratio of parallelogram (ARP) to accurately describe a multi-oriented object. Specifically, we regress coordinates of center point, height and width of minimum circumscribed rectangle of oriented object and three area ratios {\\lambda}_1, {\\lambda}_2 and {\\lambda}_3. This may facilitate the offset learning and avoid the issue of angular periodicity or label points sequence for oriented objects. To further remedy the confusion issue nearly horizontal objects, we employ the area ratio between the object and its horizontal bounding box (minimum circumscribed rectangle) to guide the selection of horizontal or oriented detection for each object. We also propose a rotation efficient IoU loss (R-EIoU) to connect the horizontal bounding box with the three area ratios and improve the accurate for the rotating bounding box. Experimental results on three remote sensing datasets including HRSC2016, DOTA and UCAS-AOD and scene text including ICDAR2015 show that our method achieves superior detection performance compared with many state-of-the-art approaches. The code and model will be coming with paper published.\n",
      "Few-shot object detection has been extensively investigated by incorporating meta-learning into region-based detection frameworks. Despite its success, the said paradigm is constrained by several factors, such as (i) low-quality region proposals for novel classes and (ii) negligence of the inter-class correlation among different classes. Such limitations hinder the generalization of base-class knowledge for the detection of novel-class objects. In this work, we design Meta-DETR, a novel few-shot detection framework that incorporates correlational aggregation for meta-learning into DETR detection frameworks. Meta-DETR works entirely at image level without any region proposals, which circumvents the constraint of inaccurate proposals in prevalent few-shot detection frameworks. Besides, Meta-DETR can simultaneously attend to multiple support classes within a single feed-forward. This unique design allows capturing the inter-class correlation among different classes, which significantly reduces the misclassification of similar classes and enhances knowledge generalization to novel classes. Experiments over multiple few-shot object detection benchmarks show that the proposed Meta-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. The implementation codes will be released at https://github.com/ZhangGongjie/Meta-DETR.\n",
      "Computer Vision has played a major role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and traffic surveillance. Along with the rapidly growing automated vehicles and crowded cities, the automated and advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) using video surveillance infrastructures have been evolved by the implementation of Deep Neural Networks. In this research, we provide a practical platform for real-time traffic monitoring, including 3D vehicle/pedestrian detection, speed detection, trajectory estimation, congestion detection, as well as monitoring the interaction of vehicles and pedestrians, all using a single CCTV traffic camera. We adapt a custom YOLOv5 deep neural network model for vehicle/pedestrian detection and an enhanced SORT tracking algorithm. For the first time, a hybrid satellite-ground based inverse perspective mapping (SG-IPM) method for camera auto-calibration is also developed which leads to an accurate 3D object detection and visualisation. We also develop a hierarchical traffic modelling solution based on short- and long-term temporal video data stream to understand the traffic flow, bottlenecks, and risky spots for vulnerable road users. Several experiments on real-world scenarios and comparisons with state-of-the-art are conducted using various traffic monitoring datasets, including MIO-TCD, UA-DETRAC and GRAM-RTM collected from highways, intersections, and urban areas under different lighting and weather conditions.\n",
      "Neural network quantization enables the deployment of models on edge devices. An essential requirement for their hardware efficiency is that the quantizers are hardware-friendly: uniform, symmetric, and with power-of-two thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, current post-training quantization methods do not support all of these constraints simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a hardware-friendly post training quantization (HPTQ) framework, which addresses this problem by synergistically combining several known quantization methods. We perform a large-scale study on four tasks: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and pose estimation over a wide variety of network architectures. Our extensive experiments show that competitive results can be obtained under hardware-friendly constraints.\n",
      "Knowledge distillation methods are proved to be promising in improving the performance of neural networks and no additional computational expenses are required during the inference time. For the sake of boosting the accuracy of object detection, a great number of knowledge distillation methods have been proposed particularly designed for object detection. However, most of these methods only focus on feature-level distillation and label-level distillation, leaving the label assignment step, a unique and paramount procedure for object detection, by the wayside. In this work, we come up with a simple but effective knowledge distillation approach focusing on label assignment in object detection, in which the positive and negative samples of student network are selected in accordance with the predictions of teacher network. Our method shows encouraging results on the MSCOCO2017 benchmark, and can not only be applied to both one-stage detectors and two-stage detectors but also be utilized orthogonally with other knowledge distillation methods.\n",
      "We propose 3DETR, an end-to-end Transformer based object detection model for 3D point clouds. Compared to existing detection methods that employ a number of 3D-specific inductive biases, 3DETR requires minimal modifications to the vanilla Transformer block. Specifically, we find that a standard Transformer with non-parametric queries and Fourier positional embeddings is competitive with specialized architectures that employ libraries of 3D-specific operators with hand-tuned hyperparameters. Nevertheless, 3DETR is conceptually simple and easy to implement, enabling further improvements by incorporating 3D domain knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we show 3DETR outperforms the well-established and highly optimized VoteNet baselines on the challenging ScanNetV2 dataset by 9.5%. Furthermore, we show 3DETR is applicable to 3D tasks beyond detection, and can serve as a building block for future research.\n",
      "We present a new and complex traffic dataset, METEOR, which captures traffic patterns in unstructured scenarios in India. METEOR consists of more than 1000 one-minute video clips, over 2 million annotated frames with ego-vehicle trajectories, and more than 13 million bounding boxes for surrounding vehicles or traffic agents. METEOR is a unique dataset in terms of capturing the heterogeneity of microscopic and macroscopic traffic characteristics. Furthermore, we provide annotations for rare and interesting driving behaviors such as cut-ins, yielding, overtaking, overspeeding, zigzagging, sudden lane changing, running traffic signals, driving in the wrong lanes, taking wrong turns, lack of right-of-way rules at intersections, etc. We also present diverse traffic scenarios corresponding to rainy weather, nighttime driving, driving in rural areas with unmarked roads, and high-density traffic scenarios. We use our novel dataset to evaluate the performance of object detection and behavior prediction algorithms. We show that state-of-the-art object detectors fail in these challenging conditions and also propose a new benchmark test: action-behavior prediction with a baseline mAP score of 70.74.\n",
      "Deep Bregman divergence measures divergence of data points using neural networks which is beyond Euclidean distance and capable of capturing divergence over distributions. In this paper, we propose deep Bregman divergences for contrastive learning of visual representation and we aim to enhance contrastive loss used in self-supervised learning by training additional networks based on functional Bregman divergence. In contrast to the conventional contrastive learning methods which are solely based on divergences between single points, our framework can capture the divergence between distributions which improves the quality of learned representation. By combining conventional contrastive loss with the proposed divergence loss, our method outperforms baseline and most of previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on multiple classifications and object detection tasks and datasets. The source code of the method and of all the experiments are available at supplementary.\n",
      "Physical adversarial attacks in object detection have attracted increasing attention. However, most previous works focus on hiding the objects from the detector by generating an individual adversarial patch, which only covers the planar part of the vehicle's surface and fails to attack the detector in physical scenarios for multi-view, long-distance and partially occluded objects. To bridge the gap between digital attacks and physical attacks, we exploit the full 3D vehicle surface to propose a robust Full-coverage Camouflage Attack (FCA) to fool detectors. Specifically, we first try rendering the non-planar camouflage texture over the full vehicle surface. To mimic the real-world environment conditions, we then introduce a transformation function to transfer the rendered camouflaged vehicle into a photo-realistic scenario. Finally, we design an efficient loss function to optimize the camouflage texture. Experiments show that the full-coverage camouflage attack can not only outperform state-of-the-art methods under various test cases but also generalize to different environments, vehicles, and object detectors.\n",
      "Multi-task learning (MTL) is an efficient way to improve the performance of related tasks by sharing knowledge. However, most existing MTL networks run on a single end and are not suitable for collaborative intelligence (CI) scenarios. In this work, we propose an MTL network with a deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, which allows operating under CI scenarios. We first propose a feature fusion based MTL network (FFMNet) for joint object detection and semantic segmentation. Compared with other MTL networks, FFMNet gets higher performance with fewer parameters. Then FFMNet is split into two parts, which run on a mobile device and an edge server respectively. The feature generated by the mobile device is transmitted through the wireless channel to the edge server. To reduce the transmission overhead of the intermediate feature, a deep JSCC network is designed. By combining two networks together, the whole model achieves 512 times compression for the intermediate feature and a performance loss within 2% on both tasks. At last, by training with noise, the FFMNet with JSCC is robust to various channel conditions and outperforms the separate source and channel coding scheme.\n",
      "Unsupervised domain adaptation, which involves transferring knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain, can be used to substantially reduce annotation costs in the field of object detection. In this study, we demonstrate that adversarial training in the source domain can be employed as a new approach for unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, we establish that adversarially trained detectors achieve improved detection performance in target domains that are significantly shifted from source domains. This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that adversarially trained detectors can be used to extract robust features that are in alignment with human perception and worth transferring across domains while discarding domain-specific non-robust features. In addition, we propose a method that combines adversarial training and feature alignment to ensure the improved alignment of robust features with the target domain. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach on large domain shifts from real to artistic images. Compared to the baseline models, the adversarially trained detectors improve the mean average precision by up to 7.7\\%, and further by up to 11.8\\% when feature alignments are incorporated.\n",
      "Multitask learning is a common approach in machine learning, which allows to train multiple objectives with a shared architecture. It has been shown that by training multiple tasks together inference time and compute resources can be saved, while the objectives performance remains on a similar or even higher level. However, in perception related multitask networks only closely related tasks can be found, such as object detection, instance and semantic segmentation or depth estimation. Multitask networks with diverse tasks and their effects with respect to efficiency on one another are not well studied. In this paper we augment the CenterNet anchor-free approach for training multiple diverse perception related tasks together, including the task of object detection and semantic segmentation as well as human pose estimation. We refer to this DNN as Multitask-CenterNet (MCN). Additionally, we study different MCN settings for efficiency. The MCN can perform several tasks at once while maintaining, and in some cases even exceeding, the performance values of its corresponding single task networks. More importantly, the MCN architecture decreases inference time and reduces network size when compared to a composition of single task networks.\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that hierarchical Vision Transformer with a macro architecture of interleaved non-overlapped window-based self-attention \\& shifted-window operation is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various visual recognition tasks, and challenges the ubiquitous convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using densely slid kernels. Most follow-up works attempt to replace the shifted-window operation with other kinds of cross-window communication paradigms, while treating self-attention as the de-facto standard for window-based information aggregation. In this manuscript, we question whether self-attention is the only choice for hierarchical Vision Transformer to attain strong performance, and the effects of different kinds of cross-window communication. To this end, we replace self-attention layers with embarrassingly simple linear mapping layers, and the resulting proof-of-concept architecture termed as LinMapper can achieve very strong performance in ImageNet-1k image recognition. Moreover, we find that LinMapper is able to better leverage the pre-trained representations from image recognition and demonstrates excellent transfer learning properties on downstream dense prediction tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. We also experiment with other alternatives to self-attention for content aggregation inside each non-overlapped window under different cross-window communication approaches, which all give similar competitive results. Our study reveals that the \\textbf{macro architecture} of Swin model families, other than specific aggregation layers or specific means of cross-window communication, may be more responsible for its strong performance and is the real challenger to the ubiquitous CNN's dense sliding window paradigm. Code and models will be publicly available to facilitate future research.\n",
      "Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works.\n",
      "The use of mobiles phones when driving have been a major factor when it comes to road traffic incidents and the process of capturing such violations can be a laborious task. Advancements in both modern object detection frameworks and high-performance hardware has paved the way for a more automated approach when it comes to video surveillance. In this work, we propose a custom-trained state-of-the-art object detector to work with roadside cameras to capture driver phone usage without the need for human intervention. The proposed approach also addresses the issues caused by windscreen glare and introduces the steps required to remedy this. Twelve pre-trained models are fine-tuned with our custom dataset using four popular object detection methods: YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and CenterNet. Out of all the object detectors tested, the YOLO yields the highest accuracy levels of up to 96% (AP10) and frame rates of up to ~30 FPS. DeepSort object tracking algorithm is also integrated into the best-performing model to collect records of only the unique violations, and enable the proposed approach to count the number of vehicles. The proposed automated system will collect the output images of the identified violations, timestamps of each violation, and total vehicle count. Data can be accessed via a purpose-built user interface.\n",
      "Moving object detection is a crucial task in computer vision. Event-based cameras are bio-inspired cameras that work by mimicking the working of the human eye. These cameras have multiple advantages over conventional frame-based cameras, like reduced latency, HDR, reduced motion blur during high motion, low power consumption, etc. However, these advantages come at a high cost, as event-based cameras are noise sensitive and have low resolution. Moreover, the task of moving object detection in these cameras is difficult, as event-based sensors capture only the binary changes in brightness of a scene, lacking useful visual features like texture and color. In this paper, we investigate the application of the k-means clustering technique in detecting moving objects in event-based data. Experimental results in publicly available datasets using k-means show significant improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Knowledge distillation has become one of the most important model compression techniques by distilling knowledge from larger teacher networks to smaller student ones. Although great success has been achieved by prior distillation methods via delicately designing various types of knowledge, they overlook the functional properties of neural networks, which makes the process of applying those techniques to new tasks unreliable and non-trivial. To alleviate such problem, in this paper, we initially leverage Lipschitz continuity to better represent the functional characteristic of neural networks and guide the knowledge distillation process. In particular, we propose a novel Lipschitz Continuity Guided Knowledge Distillation framework to faithfully distill knowledge by minimizing the distance between two neural networks' Lipschitz constants, which enables teacher networks to better regularize student networks and improve the corresponding performance. We derive an explainable approximation algorithm with an explicit theoretical derivation to address the NP-hard problem of calculating the Lipschitz constant. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms other benchmarks over several knowledge distillation tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation and object detection) on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and PASCAL VOC datasets.\n",
      "Learning requires both study and curiosity. A good learner is not only good at extracting information from the data given to it, but also skilled at finding the right new information to learn from. This is especially true when a human operator is required to provide the ground truth - such a source should only be queried sparingly. In this work, we address the problem of curiosity as it relates to online, real-time, human-in-the-loop training of an object detection algorithm onboard a robotic platform, one where motion produces new views of the subject. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach that decides when to ask the human user for ground truth, and when to move. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our agent learns a movement and request policy that is at least 3x more effective at using human user interactions to train an object detector than untrained approaches, and is generalizable to a variety of subjects and environments.\n",
      "Object detection on drone-captured scenarios is a recent popular task. As drones always navigate in different altitudes, the object scale varies violently, which burdens the optimization of networks. Moreover, high-speed and low-altitude flight bring in the motion blur on the densely packed objects, which leads to great challenge of object distinction. To solve the two issues mentioned above, we propose TPH-YOLOv5. Based on YOLOv5, we add one more prediction head to detect different-scale objects. Then we replace the original prediction heads with Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH) to explore the prediction potential with self-attention mechanism. We also integrate convolutional block attention model (CBAM) to find attention region on scenarios with dense objects. To achieve more improvement of our proposed TPH-YOLOv5, we provide bags of useful strategies such as data augmentation, multiscale testing, multi-model integration and utilizing extra classifier. Extensive experiments on dataset VisDrone2021 show that TPH-YOLOv5 have good performance with impressive interpretability on drone-captured scenarios. On DET-test-challenge dataset, the AP result of TPH-YOLOv5 are 39.18%, which is better than previous SOTA method (DPNetV3) by 1.81%. On VisDrone Challenge 2021, TPHYOLOv5 wins 5th place and achieves well-matched results with 1st place model (AP 39.43%). Compared to baseline model (YOLOv5), TPH-YOLOv5 improves about 7%, which is encouraging and competitive.\n",
      "Activation functions play a pivotal role in determining the training dynamics and neural network performance. The widely adopted activation function ReLU despite being simple and effective has few disadvantages including the Dying ReLU problem. In order to tackle such problems, we propose a novel activation function called Serf which is self-regularized and nonmonotonic in nature. Like Mish, Serf also belongs to the Swish family of functions. Based on several experiments on computer vision (image classification and object detection) and natural language processing (machine translation, sentiment classification and multimodal entailment) tasks with different state-of-the-art architectures, it is observed that Serf vastly outperforms ReLU (baseline) and other activation functions including both Swish and Mish, with a markedly bigger margin on deeper architectures. Ablation studies further demonstrate that Serf based architectures perform better than those of Swish and Mish in varying scenarios, validating the effectiveness and compatibility of Serf with varying depth, complexity, optimizers, learning rates, batch sizes, initializers and dropout rates. Finally, we investigate the mathematical relation between Swish and Serf, thereby showing the impact of preconditioner function ingrained in the first derivative of Serf which provides a regularization effect making gradients smoother and optimization faster.\n",
      "Transformer architectures have become the model of choice in natural language processing and are now being introduced into computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, in the field of human pose estimation, convolutional architectures still remain dominant. In this work, we present PoseFormer, a purely transformer-based approach for 3D human pose estimation in videos without convolutional architectures involved. Inspired by recent developments in vision transformers, we design a spatial-temporal transformer structure to comprehensively model the human joint relations within each frame as well as the temporal correlations across frames, then output an accurate 3D human pose of the center frame. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method on two popular and standard benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments show that PoseFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/zczcwh/PoseFormer}\n",
      "Existing point-cloud based 3D object detectors use convolution-like operators to process information in a local neighbourhood with fixed-weight kernels and aggregate global context hierarchically. However, non-local neural networks and self-attention for 2D vision have shown that explicitly modeling long-range interactions can lead to more robust and competitive models. In this paper, we propose two variants of self-attention for contextual modeling in 3D object detection by augmenting convolutional features with self-attention features. We first incorporate the pairwise self-attention mechanism into the current state-of-the-art BEV, voxel and point-based detectors and show consistent improvement over strong baseline models of up to 1.5 3D AP while simultaneously reducing their parameter footprint and computational cost by 15-80% and 30-50%, respectively, on the KITTI validation set. We next propose a self-attention variant that samples a subset of the most representative features by learning deformations over randomly sampled locations. This not only allows us to scale explicit global contextual modeling to larger point-clouds, but also leads to more discriminative and informative feature descriptors. Our method can be flexibly applied to most state-of-the-art detectors with increased accuracy and parameter and compute efficiency. We show our proposed method improves 3D object detection performance on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/AutoVision-cloud/SA-Det3D.\n",
      "Incremental few-shot learning has emerged as a new and challenging area in deep learning, whose objective is to train deep learning models using very few samples of new class data, and none of the old class data. In this work we tackle the problem of batch incremental few-shot road object detection using data from the India Driving Dataset (IDD). Our approach, DualFusion, combines object detectors in a manner that allows us to learn to detect rare objects with very limited data, all without severely degrading the performance of the detector on the abundant classes. In the IDD OpenSet incremental few-shot detection task, we achieve a mAP50 score of 40.0 on the base classes and an overall mAP50 score of 38.8, both of which are the highest to date. In the COCO batch incremental few-shot detection task, we achieve a novel AP score of 9.9, surpassing the state-of-the-art novel class performance on the same by over 6.6 times.\n",
      "3D point cloud understanding has made great progress in recent years. However, one major bottleneck is the scarcity of annotated real datasets, especially compared to 2D object detection tasks, since a large amount of labor is involved in annotating the real scans of a scene. A promising solution to this problem is to make better use of the synthetic dataset, which consists of CAD object models, to boost the learning on real datasets. This can be achieved by the pre-training and fine-tuning procedure. However, recent work on 3D pre-training exhibits failure when transfer features learned on synthetic objects to other real-world applications. In this work, we put forward a new method called RandomRooms to accomplish this objective. In particular, we propose to generate random layouts of a scene by making use of the objects in the synthetic CAD dataset and learn the 3D scene representation by applying object-level contrastive learning on two random scenes generated from the same set of synthetic objects. The model pre-trained in this way can serve as a better initialization when later fine-tuning on the 3D object detection task. Empirically, we show consistent improvement in downstream 3D detection tasks on several base models, especially when less training data are used, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Benefiting from the rich semantic knowledge and diverse objects from synthetic data, our method establishes the new state-of-the-art on widely-used 3D detection benchmarks ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D. We expect our attempt to provide a new perspective for bridging object and scene-level 3D understanding.\n",
      "Convolutional Neural Networks achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in object detection tasks. However, they have large computational and energy requirements that challenge their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Object detection takes an image as an input, and identifies the existing object classes as well as their locations in the image. In this paper, we leverage the prior knowledge about the probabilities that different object categories can occur jointly to increase the efficiency of object detection models. In particular, our technique clusters the object categories based on their spatial co-occurrence probability. We use those clusters to design an adaptive network. During runtime, a branch controller decides which part(s) of the network to execute based on the spatial context of the input frame. Our experiments using COCO dataset show that our adaptive object detection model achieves up to 45% reduction in the energy consumption, and up to 27% reduction in the latency, with a small loss in the average precision (AP) of object detection.\n",
      "In this paper, we present a self-training method, named ST3D++, with a holistic pseudo label denoising pipeline for unsupervised domain adaptation on 3D object detection. ST3D++ aims at reducing noise in pseudo label generation as well as alleviating the negative impacts of noisy pseudo labels on model training. First, ST3D++ pre-trains the 3D object detector on the labeled source domain with random object scaling (ROS) which is designed to reduce target domain pseudo label noise arising from object scale bias of the source domain. Then, the detector is progressively improved through alternating between generating pseudo labels and training the object detector with pseudo-labeled target domain data. Here, we equip the pseudo label generation process with a hybrid quality-aware triplet memory to improve the quality and stability of generated pseudo labels. Meanwhile, in the model training stage, we propose a source data assisted training strategy and a curriculum data augmentation policy to effectively rectify noisy gradient directions and avoid model over-fitting to noisy pseudo labeled data. These specific designs enable the detector to be trained on meticulously refined pseudo labeled target data with denoised training signals, and thus effectively facilitate adapting an object detector to a target domain without requiring annotations. Finally, our method is assessed on four 3D benchmark datasets (i.e., Waymo, KITTI, Lyft, and nuScenes) for three common categories (i.e., car, pedestrian and bicycle). ST3D++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on all evaluated settings, outperforming the corresponding baseline by a large margin (e.g., 9.6% $\\sim$ 38.16% on Waymo $\\rightarrow$ KITTI in terms of AP$_{\\text{3D}}$), and even surpasses the fully supervised oracle results on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark with target prior. Code will be available.\n",
      "Monocular 3D object detection is an important task for autonomous driving considering its advantage of low cost. It is much more challenging than conventional 2D cases due to its inherent ill-posed property, which is mainly reflected in the lack of depth information. Recent progress on 2D detection offers opportunities to better solving this problem. However, it is non-trivial to make a general adapted 2D detector work in this 3D task. In this paper, we study this problem with a practice built on a fully convolutional single-stage detector and propose a general framework FCOS3D. Specifically, we first transform the commonly defined 7-DoF 3D targets to the image domain and decouple them as 2D and 3D attributes. Then the objects are distributed to different feature levels with consideration of their 2D scales and assigned only according to the projected 3D-center for the training procedure. Furthermore, the center-ness is redefined with a 2D Gaussian distribution based on the 3D-center to fit the 3D target formulation. All of these make this framework simple yet effective, getting rid of any 2D detection or 2D-3D correspondence priors. Our solution achieves 1st place out of all the vision-only methods in the nuScenes 3D detection challenge of NeurIPS 2020. Code and models are released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d.\n",
      "Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous systems which intend to operate in the real world. Single task vision networks extract information only based on some aspects of the scene. In multi-task learning (MTL), on the other hand, these single tasks are jointly learned, thereby providing an opportunity for tasks to share information and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. To this end, we develop UniNet, a unified scene understanding network that accurately and efficiently infers vital vision tasks including object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, monocular depth estimation, and monocular instance depth prediction. As these tasks look at different semantic and geometric information, they can either complement or conflict with each other. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can provide useful cues to enable complementary information sharing. We evaluate the task relationships in UniNet through the lens of adversarial attacks based on the notion that they can exploit learned biases and task interactions in the neural network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset, using untargeted and targeted attacks reveal that semantic tasks strongly interact amongst themselves, and the same holds for geometric tasks. Additionally, we show that the relationship between semantic and geometric tasks is asymmetric and their interaction becomes weaker as we move towards higher-level representations.\n",
      "Salient object detection (SOD) is viewed as a pixel-wise saliency modeling task by traditional deep learning-based methods. A limitation of current SOD models is insufficient utilization of inter-pixel information, which usually results in imperfect segmentation near edge regions and low spatial coherence. As we demonstrate, using a saliency mask as the only label is suboptimal. To address this limitation, we propose a connectivity-based approach called bilateral connectivity network (BiconNet), which uses connectivity masks together with saliency masks as labels for effective modeling of inter-pixel relationships and object saliency. Moreover, we propose a bilateral voting module to enhance the output connectivity map, and a novel edge feature enhancement method that efficiently utilizes edge-specific features. Through comprehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method can be plugged into any existing state-of-the-art saliency-based SOD framework to improve its performance with negligible parameter increase.\n",
      "This paper presents an end-to-end semi-supervised object detection approach, in contrast to previous more complex multi-stage methods. The end-to-end training gradually improves pseudo label qualities during the curriculum, and the more and more accurate pseudo labels in turn benefit object detection training. We also propose two simple yet effective techniques within this framework: a soft teacher mechanism where the classification loss of each unlabeled bounding box is weighed by the classification score produced by the teacher network; a box jittering approach to select reliable pseudo boxes for the learning of box regression. On the COCO benchmark, the proposed approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin under various labeling ratios, i.e. 1\\%, 5\\% and 10\\%. Moreover, our approach proves to perform also well when the amount of labeled data is relatively large. For example, it can improve a 40.9 mAP baseline detector trained using the full COCO training set by +3.6 mAP, reaching 44.5 mAP, by leveraging the 123K unlabeled images of COCO. On the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer based object detector (58.9 mAP on test-dev), it can still significantly improve the detection accuracy by +1.5 mAP, reaching 60.4 mAP, and improve the instance segmentation accuracy by +1.2 mAP, reaching 52.4 mAP. Further incorporating with the Object365 pre-trained model, the detection accuracy reaches 61.3 mAP and the instance segmentation accuracy reaches 53.0 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art.\n",
      "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer with a high mortality rate. Colonoscopy is the preferred procedure for CRC screening and has proven to be effective in reducing CRC mortality. Thus, a reliable computer-aided polyp detection and classification system can significantly increase the effectiveness of colonoscopy. In this paper, we create an endoscopic dataset collected from various sources and annotate the ground truth of polyp location and classification results with the help of experienced gastroenterologists. The dataset can serve as a benchmark platform to train and evaluate the machine learning models for polyp classification. We have also compared the performance of eight state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection models. The results demonstrate that deep CNN models are promising in CRC screening. This work can serve as a baseline for future research in polyp detection and classification.\n",
      "Unsupervised learning is just at a tipping point where it could really take off. Among these approaches, contrastive learning has seen tremendous progress and led to state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we construct a novel probabilistic graphical model that effectively incorporates the low rank promoting prior into the framework of contrastive learning, referred to as LORAC. In contrast to the existing conventional self-supervised approaches that only considers independent learning, our hypothesis explicitly requires that all the samples belonging to the same instance class lie on the same subspace with small dimension. This heuristic poses particular joint learning constraints to reduce the degree of freedom of the problem during the search of the optimal network parameterization. Most importantly, we argue that the low rank prior employed here is not unique, and many different priors can be invoked in a similar probabilistic way, corresponding to different hypotheses about underlying truth behind the contrastive features. Empirical evidences show that the proposed algorithm clearly surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation and keypoint detection.\n",

      "We present BoTNet, a conceptually simple yet powerful backbone architecture that incorporates self-attention for multiple computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes, our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through the design of BoTNet, we also point out how ResNet bottleneck blocks with self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. Without any bells and whistles, BoTNet achieves 44.4% Mask AP and 49.7% Box AP on the COCO Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt evaluated on the COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of 84.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to 1.64x faster in compute time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3 hardware.

      "Confluence is a novel non-Intersection over Union (IoU) alternative to Non-Maxima Suppression (NMS) in bounding box post-processing in object detection. It overcomes the inherent limitations of IoU-based NMS variants to provide a more stable, consistent predictor of bounding box clustering by using a normalized Manhattan Distance inspired proximity metric to represent bounding box clustering. Unlike Greedy and Soft NMS, it does not rely solely on classification confidence scores to select optimal bounding boxes, instead selecting the box which is closest to every other box within a given cluster and removing highly confluent neighboring boxes. Confluence is experimentally validated on the MS COCO and CrowdHuman benchmarks, improving Average Precision by up to 2.3-3.8% and Average Recall by up to 5.3-7.2% when compared against de-facto standard and state of the art NMS variants. Quantitative results are supported by extensive qualitative analysis and threshold sensitivity analysis experiments support the conclusion that Confluence is more robust than NMS variants. Confluence represents a paradigm shift in bounding box processing, with potential to replace IoU in bounding box regression processes.\n",
      "This paper revisits human-object interaction (HOI) recognition at image level without using supervisions of object location and human pose. We name it detection-free HOI recognition, in contrast to the existing detection-supervised approaches which rely on object and keypoint detections to achieve state of the art. With our method, not only the detection supervision is evitable, but superior performance can be achieved by properly using image-text pre-training (such as CLIP) and the proposed Log-Sum-Exp Sign (LSE-Sign) loss function. Specifically, using text embeddings of class labels to initialize the linear classifier is essential for leveraging the CLIP pre-trained image encoder. In addition, LSE-Sign loss facilitates learning from multiple labels on an imbalanced dataset by normalizing gradients over all classes in a softmax format. Surprisingly, our detection-free solution achieves 60.5 mAP on the HICO dataset, outperforming the detection-supervised state of the art by 13.4 mAP\n",

      "Transformer with self-attention has led to the revolutionizing of natural language processing field, and recently inspires the emergence of Transformer-style architecture design with competitive results in numerous computer vision tasks. Nevertheless, most of existing designs directly employ self-attention over a 2D feature map to obtain the attention matrix based on pairs of isolated queries and keys at each spatial location, but leave the rich contexts among neighbor keys under-exploited. In this work, we design a novel Transformer-style module, i.e., Contextual Transformer (CoT) block, for visual recognition. Such design fully capitalizes on the contextual information among input keys to guide the learning of dynamic attention matrix and thus strengthens the capacity of visual representation. Technically, CoT block first contextually encodes input keys via a $3\\times3$ convolution, leading to a static contextual representation of inputs. We further concatenate the encoded keys with input queries to learn the dynamic multi-head attention matrix through two consecutive $1\\times1$ convolutions. The learnt attention matrix is multiplied by input values to achieve the dynamic contextual representation of inputs. The fusion of the static and dynamic contextual representations are finally taken as outputs. Our CoT block is appealing in the view that it can readily replace each $3\\times3$ convolution in ResNet architectures, yielding a Transformer-style backbone named as Contextual Transformer Networks (CoTNet). Through extensive experiments over a wide range of applications (e.g., image recognition, object detection and instance segmentation), we validate the superiority of CoTNet as a stronger backbone.

      "The quantification of positively buoyant marine plastic debris is critical to understanding how concentrations of trash from across the world's ocean and identifying high concentration garbage hotspots in dire need of trash removal. Currently, the most common monitoring method to quantify floating plastic requires the use of a manta trawl. Techniques requiring manta trawls (or similar surface collection devices) utilize physical removal of marine plastic debris as the first step and then analyze collected samples as a second step. The need for physical removal before analysis incurs high costs and requires intensive labor preventing scalable deployment of a real-time marine plastic monitoring service across the entirety of Earth's ocean bodies. Without better monitoring and sampling methods, the total impact of plastic pollution on the environment as a whole, and details of impact within specific oceanic regions, will remain unknown. This study presents a highly scalable workflow that utilizes images captured within the epipelagic layer of the ocean as an input. It produces real-time quantification of marine plastic debris for accurate quantification and physical removal. The workflow includes creating and preprocessing a domain-specific dataset, building an object detection model utilizing a deep neural network, and evaluating the model's performance. YOLOv5-S was the best performing model, which operates at a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.851 and an F1-Score of 0.89 while maintaining near-real-time speed.\n",

      "As one of the prevalent components, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is widely used in the current object detection models to improve the performance of multi-scale detection. However, its interaction is still in a local and lossy manner, thus limiting the representation power. In this paper, to simulate a global view of human vision in object detection and address the inherent defects of interaction mode in FPN, we construct a novel architecture termed Content-Augmented Feature Pyramid Network (CA-FPN). Unlike the vanilla FPN, which fuses features within a local receptive field, CA-FPN can adaptively aggregate similar features from a global view. It is equipped with a global content extraction module and light linear spatial transformers. The former allows to extract multi-scale context information and the latter can deeply combine the global content extraction module with the vanilla FPN using the linearized attention function, which is designed to reduce model complexity. Furthermore, CA-FPN can be readily plugged into existing FPN-based models. Extensive experiments on the challenging COCO and PASCAL VOC object detection datasets demonstrated that our CA-FPN significantly outperforms competitive FPN-based detectors without bells and whistles. When plugging CA-FPN into Cascade R-CNN framework built upon a standard ResNet-50 backbone, our method can achieve 44.8 AP on COCO mini-val. Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 1.5 AP, demonstrating the potentiality of application.\n",

Explainability is essential for critical applications, such as defense, health care, law and order, and autonomous driving vehicles, etc, where the know-how is required for trust and transparency. A number of XAI techniques so far have been purposed for such applications. This paper provides an overview of these techniques from a multimedia (i.e., text, image, audio, and video) point of view. The advantages and shortcomings of these techniques have been discussed, and pointers to some future directions have also been provided.\n",
      "This study delves into semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) to improve detector performance with additional unlabeled data. State-of-the-art SSOD performance has been achieved recently by self-training, in which training supervision consists of ground truths and pseudo-labels. In current studies, we observe that class imbalance in SSOD severely impedes the effectiveness of self-training. To address the class imbalance, we propose adaptive class-rebalancing self-training (ACRST) with a novel memory module called CropBank. ACRST adaptively rebalances the training data with foreground instances extracted from the CropBank, thereby alleviating the class imbalance. Owing to the high complexity of detection tasks, we observe that both self-training and data-rebalancing suffer from noisy pseudo-labels in SSOD. Therefore, we propose a novel two-stage filtering algorithm to generate accurate pseudo-labels. Our method achieves satisfactory improvements on MS-COCO and VOC benchmarks. When using only 1\\% labeled data in MS-COCO, our method achieves 17.02 mAP improvement over supervised baselines, and 5.32 mAP improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Object detection in autonomous cars is commonly based on camera images and Lidar inputs, which are often used to train prediction models such as deep artificial neural networks for decision making for object recognition, adjusting speed, etc. A mistake in such decision making can be damaging; thus, it is vital to measure the reliability of decisions made by such prediction models via uncertainty measurement. Uncertainty, in deep learning models, is often measured for classification problems. However, deep learning models in autonomous driving are often multi-output regression models. Hence, we propose a novel method called PURE (Prediction sURface uncErtainty) for measuring prediction uncertainty of such regression models. We formulate the object recognition problem as a regression model with more than one outputs for finding object locations in a 2-dimensional camera view. For evaluation, we modified three widely-applied object recognition models (i.e., YoLo, SSD300 and SSD512) and used the KITTI, Stanford Cars, Berkeley DeepDrive, and NEXET datasets. Results showed the statistically significant negative correlation between prediction surface uncertainty and prediction accuracy suggesting that uncertainty significantly impacts the decisions made by autonomous driving.\n",
      "Annotating user interfaces (UIs) that involves localization and classification of meaningful UI elements on a screen is a critical step for many mobile applications such as screen readers and voice control of devices. Annotating object icons, such as menu, search, and arrow backward, is especially challenging due to the lack of explicit labels on screens, their similarity to pictures, and their diverse shapes. Existing studies either use view hierarchy or pixel based methods to tackle the task. Pixel based approaches are more popular as view hierarchy features on mobile platforms are often incomplete or inaccurate, however it leaves out instructional information in the view hierarchy such as resource-ids or content descriptions. We propose a novel deep learning based multi-modal approach that combines the benefits of both pixel and view hierarchy features as well as leverages the state-of-the-art object detection techniques. In order to demonstrate the utility provided, we create a high quality UI dataset by manually annotating the most commonly used 29 icons in Rico, a large scale mobile design dataset consisting of 72k UI screenshots. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our multi-modal approach. Our model not only outperforms a widely used object classification baseline but also pixel based object detection models. Our study sheds light on how to combine view hierarchy with pixel features for annotating UI elements.\n",
      "Point clouds and RGB images are naturally complementary modalities for 3D visual understanding - the former provides sparse but accurate locations of points on objects, while the latter contains dense color and texture information. Despite this potential for close sensor fusion, many methods train two models in isolation and use simple feature concatenation to represent 3D sensor data. This separated training scheme results in potentially sub-optimal performance and prevents 3D tasks from being used to benefit 2D tasks that are often useful on their own. To provide a more integrated approach, we propose a novel Multi-Modality Task Cascade network (MTC-RCNN) that leverages 3D box proposals to improve 2D segmentation predictions, which are then used to further refine the 3D boxes. We show that including a 2D network between two stages of 3D modules significantly improves both 2D and 3D task performance. Moreover, to prevent the 3D module from over-relying on the overfitted 2D predictions, we propose a dual-head 2D segmentation training and inference scheme, allowing the 2nd 3D module to learn to interpret imperfect 2D segmentation predictions. Evaluating our model on the challenging SUN RGB-D dataset, we improve upon state-of-the-art results of both single modality and fusion networks by a large margin ($\\textbf{+3.8}$ mAP@0.5). Code will be released $\\href{https://github.com/Divadi/MTC_RCNN}{\\text{here.}}$\n",
      "Vanilla models for object detection and instance segmentation suffer from the heavy bias toward detecting frequent objects in the long-tailed setting. Existing methods address this issue mostly during training, e.g., by re-sampling or re-weighting. In this paper, we investigate a largely overlooked approach -- post-processing calibration of confidence scores. We propose NorCal, Normalized Calibration for long-tailed object detection and instance segmentation, a simple and straightforward recipe that reweighs the predicted scores of each class by its training sample size. We show that separately handling the background class and normalizing the scores over classes for each proposal are keys to achieving superior performance. On the LVIS dataset, NorCal can effectively improve nearly all the baseline models not only on rare classes but also on common and frequent classes. Finally, we conduct extensive analysis and ablation studies to offer insights into various modeling choices and mechanisms of our approach.\n",
      "The detection of semantic relationships between objects represented in an image is one of the fundamental challenges in image interpretation. Neural-Symbolic techniques, such as Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs), allow the combination of semantic knowledge representation and reasoning with the ability to efficiently learn from examples typical of neural networks. We here propose Faster-LTN, an object detector composed of a convolutional backbone and an LTN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine both frameworks in an end-to-end training setting. This architecture is trained by optimizing a grounded theory which combines labelled examples with prior knowledge, in the form of logical axioms. Experimental comparisons show competitive performance with respect to the traditional Faster R-CNN architecture.\n",
      "Recently, Vision Transformer and its variants have shown great promise on various computer vision tasks. The ability of capturing short- and long-range visual dependencies through self-attention is arguably the main source for the success. But it also brings challenges due to quadratic computational overhead, especially for the high-resolution vision tasks (e.g., object detection). In this paper, we present focal self-attention, a new mechanism that incorporates both fine-grained local and coarse-grained global interactions. Using this new mechanism, each token attends the closest surrounding tokens at fine granularity but the tokens far away at coarse granularity, and thus can capture both short- and long-range visual dependencies efficiently and effectively. With focal self-attention, we propose a new variant of Vision Transformer models, called Focal Transformer, which achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art vision Transformers on a range of public image classification and object detection benchmarks. In particular, our Focal Transformer models with a moderate size of 51.1M and a larger size of 89.8M achieve 83.5 and 83.8 Top-1 accuracy, respectively, on ImageNet classification at 224x224 resolution. Using Focal Transformers as the backbones, we obtain consistent and substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art Swin Transformers for 6 different object detection methods trained with standard 1x and 3x schedules. Our largest Focal Transformer yields 58.7/58.9 box mAPs and 50.9/51.3 mask mAPs on COCO mini-val/test-dev, and 55.4 mIoU on ADE20K for semantic segmentation, creating new SoTA on three of the most challenging computer vision tasks.\n",
      "The speed-accuracy Pareto curve of object detection systems have advanced through a combination of better model architectures, training and inference methods. In this paper, we methodically evaluate a variety of these techniques to understand where most of the improvements in modern detection systems come from. We benchmark these improvements on the vanilla ResNet-FPN backbone with RetinaNet and RCNN detectors. The vanilla detectors are improved by 7.7% in accuracy while being 30% faster in speed. We further provide simple scaling strategies to generate family of models that form two Pareto curves, named RetinaNet-RS and Cascade RCNN-RS. These simple rescaled detectors explore the speed-accuracy trade-off between the one-stage RetinaNet detectors and two-stage RCNN detectors. Our largest Cascade RCNN-RS models achieve 52.9% AP with a ResNet152-FPN backbone and 53.6% with a SpineNet143L backbone. Finally, we show the ResNet architecture, with three minor architectural changes, outperforms EfficientNet as the backbone for object detection and instance segmentation systems.\n",
      "To reduce annotation labor associated with object detection, an increasing number of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods assume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which ignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple source domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster R-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which can simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power. Specifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo target subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to conduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features, respectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second, we develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal parameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in different source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region proposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract invariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n",
      "Object detection plays an important role in self-driving cars for security development. However, mobile systems on self-driving cars with limited computation resources lead to difficulties for object detection. To facilitate this, we propose a compiler-aware neural pruning search framework to achieve high-speed inference on autonomous vehicles for 2D and 3D object detection. The framework automatically searches the pruning scheme and rate for each layer to find a best-suited pruning for optimizing detection accuracy and speed performance under compiler optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that for the first time, the proposed method achieves (close-to) real-time, 55ms and 99ms inference times for YOLOv4 based 2D object detection and PointPillars based 3D detection, respectively, on an off-the-shelf mobile phone with minor (or no) accuracy loss.\n",
      "Remote examination and job interviews have gained popularity and become indispensable because of both pandemics and the advantage of remote working circumstances. Most companies and academic institutions utilize these systems for their recruitment processes and also for online exams. However, one of the critical problems of the remote examination systems is conducting the exams in a reliable environment. In this work, we present a cheating analysis pipeline for online interviews and exams. The system only requires a video of the candidate, which is recorded during the exam. Then cheating detection pipeline is employed to detect another person, electronic device usage, and candidate absence status. The pipeline consists of face detection, face recognition, object detection, and face tracking algorithms. To evaluate the performance of the pipeline we collected a private video dataset. The video dataset includes both cheating activities and clean videos. Ultimately, our pipeline presents an efficient and fast guideline to detect and analyze cheating activities in an online interview and exam video.\n",
      "In this paper, we present a real-time 3D detection approach considering time-spatial feature map aggregation from different time steps of deep neural model inference (named feature map flow, FMF). Proposed approach improves the quality of 3D detection center-based baseline and provides real-time performance on the nuScenes and Waymo benchmark. Code is available at https://github.com/YoushaaMurhij/FMFNet\n",
      "Recently, query based deep networks catch lots of attention owing to their end-to-end pipeline and competitive results on several fundamental computer vision tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. However, how to establish a query based video instance segmentation (VIS) framework with elegant architecture and strong performance remains to be settled. In this paper, we present \\textbf{QueryTrack} (i.e., tracking instances as queries), a unified query based VIS framework fully leveraging the intrinsic one-to-one correspondence between instances and queries in QueryInst. The proposed method obtains 52.7 / 52.3 AP on YouTube-VIS-2019 / 2021 datasets, which wins the 2-nd place in the YouTube-VIS Challenge at CVPR 2021 \\textbf{with a single online end-to-end model, single scale testing \\& modest amount of training data}. We also provide QueryTrack-ResNet-50 baseline results on YouTube-VIS-2021 val set as references for the VIS community.\n",
      "While common image object detection tasks focus on bounding boxes or segmentation masks as object representations, we consider the problem of finding objects based on four arbitrary vertices. We propose a novel model, named TetraPackNet, to tackle this problem. TetraPackNet is based on CornerNet and uses similar algorithms and ideas. It is designated for applications requiring high-accuracy detection of regularly shaped objects, which is the case in the logistics use-case of packaging structure recognition. We evaluate our model on our specific real-world dataset for this use-case. Baselined against a previous solution, consisting of a Mask R-CNN model and suitable post-processing steps, TetraPackNet achieves superior results (9% higher in accuracy) in the sub-task of four-corner based transport unit side detection.\n",
      "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects using only few examples. It's critically needed for many practical applications but so far remains challenging. We propose a meta-learning based few-shot object detection method by transferring meta-knowledge learned from data-abundant base classes to data-scarce novel classes. Our method incorporates a coarse-to-fine approach into the proposal based object detection framework and integrates prototype based classifiers into both the proposal generation and classification stages. To improve proposal generation for few-shot novel classes, we propose to learn a lightweight matching network to measure the similarity between each spatial position in the query image feature map and spatially-pooled class features, instead of the traditional object/nonobject classifier, thus generating category-specific proposals and improving proposal recall for novel classes. To address the spatial misalignment between generated proposals and few-shot class examples, we propose a novel attentive feature alignment method, thus improving the performance of few-shot object detection. Meanwhile we jointly learn a Faster R-CNN detection head for base classes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple FSOD benchmarks show our proposed approach achieves state of the art results under (incremental) few-shot learning settings.\n",
      "In recent years, a lot of attention is paid to deep learning methods in the context of vision-based construction site safety systems, especially regarding personal protective equipment. However, despite all this attention, there is still no reliable way to establish the relationship between workers and their hard hats. To answer this problem a combination of deep learning, object detection and head keypoint localization, with simple rule-based reasoning is proposed in this article. In tests, this solution surpassed the previous methods based on the relative bounding box position of different instances, as well as direct detection of hard hat wearers and non-wearers. The results show that the conjunction of novel deep learning methods with humanly-interpretable rule-based systems can result in a solution that is both reliable and can successfully mimic manual, on-site supervision. This work is the next step in the development of fully autonomous construction site safety systems and shows that there is still room for improvement in this area.\n",
      "Can Transformer perform $2\\mathrm{D}$ object-level recognition from a pure sequence-to-sequence perspective with minimal knowledge about the $2\\mathrm{D}$ spatial structure? To answer this question, we present You Only Look at One Sequence (YOLOS), a series of object detection models based on the na\\\"ive Vision Transformer with the fewest possible modifications as well as inductive biases. We find that YOLOS pre-trained on the mid-sized ImageNet-$1k$ dataset only can already achieve competitive object detection performance on COCO, \\textit{e.g.}, YOLOS-Base directly adopted from BERT-Base can achieve $42.0$ box AP. We also discuss the impacts as well as limitations of current pre-train schemes and model scaling strategies for Transformer in vision through object detection. Code and model weights are available at \\url{https://github.com/hustvl/YOLOS}.\n",
      "Occlusion is one of the most significant challenges encountered by object detectors and trackers. While both object detection and tracking has received a lot of attention in the past, most existing methods in this domain do not target detecting or tracking objects when they are occluded. However, being able to detect or track an object of interest through occlusion has been a long standing challenge for different autonomous tasks. Traditional methods that employ visual object trackers with explicit occlusion modeling experience drift and make several fundamental assumptions about the data. We propose to address this with a `tracking-by-detection` approach that builds upon the success of region based video object detectors. Our video level object detector uses a novel recurrent computational unit at its core that enables long term propagation of object features even under occlusion. Finally, we compare our approach with existing state-of-the-art video object detectors and show that our approach achieves superior results on a dataset of furniture assembly videos collected from the internet, where small objects like screws, nuts, and bolts often get occluded from the camera viewpoint.\n",
      "When interacting with objects through cameras, or pictures, users often have a specific intent. For example, they may want to perform a visual search. However, most object detection models ignore the user intent, relying on image pixels as their only input. This often leads to incorrect results, such as lack of a high-confidence detection on the object of interest, or detection with a wrong class label. In this paper we investigate techniques to modulate standard object detectors to explicitly account for the user intent, expressed as an embedding of a simple query. Compared to standard object detectors, query-modulated detectors show superior performance at detecting objects for a given label of interest. Thanks to large-scale training data synthesized from standard object detection annotations, query-modulated detectors can also outperform specialized referring expression recognition systems. Furthermore, they can be simultaneously trained to solve for both query-modulated detection and standard object detection.\n",
      "With the rise of deep learning models in the field of computer vision, new possibilities for their application in industrial processes proves to return great benefits. Nevertheless, the actual fit of machine learning for highly standardised industrial processes is still under debate. This paper addresses the challenges on the industrial realization of the AI tools, considering the use case of Laser Beam Welding quality control as an example. We use object detection algorithms from the TensorFlow object detection API and adapt them to our use case using transfer learning. The baseline models we develop are used as benchmarks and evaluated and compared to models that undergo dataset scaling and hyperparameter tuning. We find that moderate scaling of the dataset via image augmentation leads to improvements in intersection over union (IoU) and recall, whereas high levels of augmentation and scaling may lead to deterioration of results. Finally, we put our results into perspective of the underlying use case and evaluate their fit.\n",
      "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective in solving many real-world problems. Larger DNN models usually exhibit better quality (e.g., accuracy) but their excessive computation results in long training and inference time. Model sparsification can reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining model quality. Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove weights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in each layer. The inefficiency of the algorithms reduces the achievable sparsity level. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained dense models and thus suffer from large memory footprint and long training time. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduled grow-and-prune (GaP) methodology without pre-training the dense models. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous works by repeatedly growing a subset of layers to dense and then pruning back to sparse after some training. Experiments have shown that such models can match or beat the quality of highly optimized dense models at 80% sparsity on a variety of tasks, such as image classification, objective detection, 3D object part segmentation, and translation. They also outperform other state-of-the-art (SOTA) pruning methods, including pruning from pre-trained dense models. As an example, a 90% sparse ResNet-50 obtained via GaP achieves 77.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, improving the SOTA results by 1.5%.\n",
      "This paper starts by revealing a surprising finding: without any learning, a randomly initialized CNN can localize objects surprisingly well. That is, a CNN has an inductive bias to naturally focus on objects, named as Tobias (``The object is at sight'') in this paper. This empirical inductive bias is further analyzed and successfully applied to self-supervised learning. A CNN is encouraged to learn representations that focus on the foreground object, by transforming every image into various versions with different backgrounds, where the foreground and background separation is guided by Tobias. Experimental results show that the proposed Tobias significantly improves downstream tasks, especially for object detection. This paper also shows that Tobias has consistent improvements on training sets of different sizes, and is more resilient to changes in image augmentations. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/CupidJay/Tobias.\n",
      "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly closing the gap with supervised methods on large computer vision benchmarks. A successful approach to SSL is to learn embeddings which are invariant to distortions of the input sample. However, a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial constant solutions. Most current methods avoid such solutions by careful implementation details. We propose an objective function that naturally avoids collapse by measuring the cross-correlation matrix between the outputs of two identical networks fed with distorted versions of a sample, and making it as close to the identity matrix as possible. This causes the embedding vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar, while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors. The method is called Barlow Twins, owing to neuroscientist H. Barlow's redundancy-reduction principle applied to a pair of identical networks. Barlow Twins does not require large batches nor asymmetry between the network twins such as a predictor network, gradient stopping, or a moving average on the weight updates. Intriguingly it benefits from very high-dimensional output vectors. Barlow Twins outperforms previous methods on ImageNet for semi-supervised classification in the low-data regime, and is on par with current state of the art for ImageNet classification with a linear classifier head, and for transfer tasks of classification and object detection.\n",
      "We present FedScale, a diverse set of challenging and realistic benchmark datasets to facilitate scalable, comprehensive, and reproducible federated learning (FL) research. FedScale datasets are large-scale, encompassing a diverse range of important FL tasks, such as image classification, object detection, language modeling, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. For each dataset, we provide a unified evaluation protocol using realistic data splits and evaluation metrics.

      "Detecting small objects in video streams of head-worn augmented reality devices in near real-time is a huge challenge: training data is typically scarce, the input video stream can be of limited quality, and small objects are notoriously hard to detect. In industrial scenarios, however, it is often possible to leverage contextual knowledge for the detection of small objects. Furthermore, CAD data of objects are typically available and can be used to generate synthetic training data. We describe a near real-time small object detection pipeline for egocentric perception in a manual assembly scenario: We generate a training data set based on CAD data and realistic backgrounds in Unity. We then train a YOLOv4 model for a two-stage detection process: First, the context is recognized, then the small object of interest is detected. We evaluate our pipeline on the augmented reality device Microsoft Hololens 2.\n",
      "We propose D-RISE, a method for generating visual explanations for the predictions of object detectors. Utilizing the proposed similarity metric that accounts for both localization and categorization aspects of object detection allows our method to produce saliency maps that show image areas that most affect the prediction. D-RISE can be considered \"black-box\" in the software testing sense, as it only needs access to the inputs and outputs of an object detector. Compared to gradient-based methods, D-RISE is more general and agnostic to the particular type of object detector being tested, and does not need knowledge of the inner workings of the model. We show that D-RISE can be easily applied to different object detectors including one-stage detectors such as YOLOv3 and two-stage detectors such as Faster-RCNN. We present a detailed analysis of the generated visual explanations to highlight the utilization of context and possible biases learned by object detectors.\n",
      "Knowledge distillation constitutes a simple yet effective way to improve the performance of a compact student network by exploiting the knowledge of a more powerful teacher. Nevertheless, the knowledge distillation literature remains limited to the scenario where the student and the teacher tackle the same task. Here, we investigate the problem of transferring knowledge not only across architectures but also across tasks. To this end, we study the case of object detection and, instead of following the standard detector-to-detector distillation approach, introduce a classifier-to-detector knowledge transfer framework. In particular, we propose strategies to exploit the classification teacher to improve both the detector's recognition accuracy and localization performance. Our experiments on several detectors with different backbones demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, allowing us to outperform the state-of-the-art detector-to-detector distillation methods.\n",
      "Human identification plays a prominent role in terms of security. In modern times security is becoming the key term for an individual or a country, especially for countries which are facing internal or external threats. Gait analysis is interpreted as the systematic study of the locomotive in humans. It can be used to extract the exact walking features of individuals. Walking features depends on biological as well as the physical feature of the object; hence, it is unique to every individual. In this work, gait features are used to identify an individual. The steps involve object detection, background subtraction, silhouettes extraction, skeletonization, and training 3D Convolution Neural Network on these gait features. The model is trained and evaluated on the dataset acquired by CASIA B Gait, which consists of 15000 videos of 124 subjects walking pattern captured from 11 different angles carrying objects such as bag and coat. The proposed method focuses more on the lower body part to extract features such as the angle between knee and thighs, hip angle, angle of contact, and many other features. The experimental results are compared with amongst accuracies of silhouettes as datasets for training and skeletonized image as training data. The results show that extracting the information from skeletonized data yields improved accuracy.\n",
      "Road infrastructure maintenance inspection is typically a labour-intensive and critical task to ensure the safety of all the road users. In this work, we propose a detailed methodology to use state-of-the-art techniques in artificial intelligence and computer vision to automate a sizeable portion of the maintenance inspection subtasks and reduce the labour costs. The proposed methodology uses state-of-the-art computer vision techniques such as object detection and semantic segmentation to automate inspections on primary road structures such as the road surface, markings, barriers (guardrails) and traffic signs. The models are mostly trained on commercially viable datasets and augmented with proprietary data. We demonstrate that our AI models can not only automate and scale maintenance inspections on primary road structures but also result in higher recall compared to traditional manual inspections.\n",
      "We show that object detectors can hallucinate and detect missing objects; potentially even accurately localized at their expected, but non-existing, position. This is particularly problematic for applications that rely on visual part verification: detecting if an object part is present or absent. We show how popular object detectors hallucinate objects in a visual part verification task and introduce the first visual part verification dataset: DelftBikes, which has 10,000 bike photographs, with 22 densely annotated parts per image, where some parts may be missing. We explicitly annotated an extra object state label for each part to reflect if a part is missing or intact. We propose to evaluate visual part verification by relying on recall and compare popular object detectors on DelftBikes.\n",
      "Existing rotated object detectors are mostly inherited from the horizontal detection paradigm, as the latter has evolved into a well-developed area. However, these detectors are difficult to perform prominently in high-precision detection due to the limitation of current regression loss design, especially for objects with large aspect ratios. Taking the perspective that horizontal detection is a special case for rotated object detection, in this paper, we are motivated to change the design of rotation regression loss from induction paradigm to deduction methodology, in terms of the relation between rotation and horizontal detection. We show that one essential challenge is how to modulate the coupled parameters in the rotation regression loss, as such the estimated parameters can influence to each other during the dynamic joint optimization, in an adaptive and synergetic way. Specifically, we first convert the rotated bounding box into a 2-D Gaussian distribution, and then calculate the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the Gaussian distributions as the regression loss. By analyzing the gradient of each parameter, we show that KLD (and its derivatives) can dynamically adjust the parameter gradients according to the characteristics of the object. It will adjust the importance (gradient weight) of the angle parameter according to the aspect ratio. This mechanism can be vital for high-precision detection as a slight angle error would cause a serious accuracy drop for large aspect ratios objects. More importantly, we have proved that KLD is scale invariant. We further show that the KLD loss can be degenerated into the popular $l_{n}$-norm loss for horizontal detection. Experimental results on seven datasets using different detectors show its consistent superiority, and codes are available at https://github.com/yangxue0827/RotationDetection.\n",
      "Vision-language pre-training (VLP) on large-scale image-text pairs has achieved huge success for the cross-modal downstream tasks. The most existing pre-training methods mainly adopt a two-step training procedure, which firstly employs a pre-trained object detector to extract region-based visual features, then concatenates the image representation and text embedding as the input of Transformer to train. However, these methods face problems of using task-specific visual representation of the specific object detector for generic cross-modal understanding, and the computation inefficiency of two-stage pipeline. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end vision-language pre-trained model for both V+L understanding and generation, namely E2E-VLP, where we build a unified Transformer framework to jointly learn visual representation, and semantic alignments between image and text. We incorporate the tasks of object detection and image captioning into pre-training with a unified Transformer encoder-decoder architecture for enhancing visual learning. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted on well-established vision-language downstream tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel VLP paradigm.\n",
      "Human activity recognition in videos is a challenging problem that has drawn a lot of interest, particularly when the goal requires the analysis of a large video database. AOLME project provides a collaborative learning environment for middle school students to explore mathematics, computer science, and engineering by processing digital images and videos. As part of this project, around 2200 hours of video data was collected for analysis. Because of the size of the dataset, it is hard to analyze all the videos of the dataset manually. Thus, there is a huge need for reliable computer-based methods that can detect activities of interest. My thesis is focused on the development of accurate methods for detecting and tracking objects in long videos. All the models are validated on videos from 7 different sessions, ranging from 45 minutes to 90 minutes. The keyboard detector achieved a very high average precision (AP) of 92% at 0.5 intersection over union (IoU). Furthermore, a combined system of the detector with a fast tracker KCF (159fps) was developed so that the algorithm runs significantly faster without sacrificing accuracy. For a video of 23 minutes having resolution 858X480 @ 30 fps, the detection alone runs at 4.7Xthe real-time, and the combined algorithm runs at 21Xthe real-time for an average IoU of 0.84 and 0.82, respectively. The hand detector achieved average precision (AP) of 72% at 0.5 IoU. The detection results were improved to 81% using optimal data augmentation parameters. The hand detector runs at 4.7Xthe real-time with AP of 81% at 0.5 IoU. The hand detection method was integrated with projections and clustering for accurate proposal generation. This approach reduced the number of false-positive hand detections by 80%.

      "In this paper, two novel automatic and real-time systems for the detection and classification of two genera of scorpions found in La Plata city (Argentina) were developed using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The object detection technique was implemented with two different methods, YOLO (You Only Look Once) and MobileNet, based on the shape features of the scorpions. High accuracy values of 88% and 91%, and high recall values of 90% and 97%, have been achieved for both models, respectively, which guarantees that they can successfully detect scorpions. In addition, the MobileNet method has been shown to have excellent performance to detect scorpions within an uncontrolled environment and to perform multiple detections. The MobileNet model was also used for image classification in order to successfully distinguish between dangerous scorpion (Tityus) and non-dangerous scorpion (Bothriurus) with the purpose of providing a health security tool. Applications for smartphones were developed, with the advantage of the portability of the systems, which can be used as a help tool for emergency services, or for biological research purposes. The developed systems can be easily scalable to other genera and species of scorpions to extend the region where these applications can be used.\n",
      "It is difficult to determine the scale and aspect ratio of anchors for anchor-based object detection methods. Current state-of-the-art object detectors either determine anchor parameters according to objects' shape and scale in a dataset, or avoid this problem by utilizing anchor-free method. In this paper, we propose a gradient-free anchor augmentation method named AADI, which means Augmenting Anchors by the Detector Itself. AADI is not an anchor-free method, but it converts the scale and aspect ratio of anchors from a continuous space to a discrete space, which greatly alleviates the problem of anchors' designation. Furthermore, AADI does not add any parameters or hyper-parameters, which is beneficial for future research and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset show that AADI has obvious advantages for both two-stage and single-stage methods, specifically, AADI achieves at least 2.1 AP improvements on Faster R-CNN and 1.6 AP improvements on RetinaNet, using ResNet-50 model. We hope that this simple and cost-efficient method can be widely used in object detection.\n",
      "This paper presents a new Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture Multi-Scale Vision Longformer, which significantly enhances the ViT of \\cite{dosovitskiy2020image} for encoding high-resolution images using two techniques. The first is the multi-scale model structure, which provides image encodings at multiple scales with manageable computational cost. The second is the attention mechanism of vision Longformer, which is a variant of Longformer \\cite{beltagy2020longformer}, originally developed for natural language processing, and achieves a linear complexity w.r.t. the number of input tokens. A comprehensive empirical study shows that the new ViT significantly outperforms several strong baselines, including the existing ViT models and their ResNet counterparts, and the Pyramid Vision Transformer from a concurrent work \\cite{wang2021pyramid}, on a range of vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

      "We propose Joint-DetNAS, a unified NAS framework for object detection, which integrates 3 key components: Neural Architecture Search, pruning, and Knowledge Distillation. Instead of naively pipelining these techniques, our Joint-DetNAS optimizes them jointly. The algorithm consists of two core processes: student morphism optimizes the student's architecture and removes the redundant parameters, while dynamic distillation aims to find the optimal matching teacher. For student morphism, weight inheritance strategy is adopted, allowing the student to flexibly update its architecture while fully utilize the predecessor's weights, which considerably accelerates the search; To facilitate dynamic distillation, an elastic teacher pool is trained via integrated progressive shrinking strategy, from which teacher detectors can be sampled without additional cost in subsequent searches. Given a base detector as the input, our algorithm directly outputs the derived student detector with high performance without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that our Joint-DetNAS outperforms the naive pipelining approach by a great margin. Given a classic R101-FPN as the base detector, Joint-DetNAS is able to boost its mAP from 41.4 to 43.9 on MS COCO and reduce the latency by 47%, which is on par with the SOTA EfficientDet while requiring less search cost. We hope our proposed method can provide the community with a new way of jointly optimizing NAS, KD and pruning.\n",
      "Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are a prominent class of adversarial examples that exploit the systemic vulnerabilities and enable physically realizable and robust attacks against Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). UAPs generalize across many different inputs; this leads to realistic and effective attacks that can be applied at scale. In this paper we propose HyperNeuron, an efficient and scalable algorithm that allows for the real-time detection of UAPs by identifying suspicious neuron hyper-activations. Our results show the effectiveness of HyperNeuron on multiple tasks (image classification, object detection), against a wide variety of universal attacks, and in realistic scenarios, like perceptual ad-blocking and adversarial patches. HyperNeuron is able to simultaneously detect both adversarial mask and patch UAPs with comparable or better performance than existing UAP defenses whilst introducing a significantly reduced latency of only 0.86 milliseconds per image. This suggests that many realistic and practical universal attacks can be reliably mitigated in real-time, which shows promise for the robust deployment of machine learning systems.\n",

Therefore, two issues are mainly studied in this article: (1) How to let the backbone network in the anchor-free object detection model learn feature extraction? (2) How to make better use of the feature pyramid network? In order to solve the above problems, Experiments show that our model has a certain improvement in accuracy compared with the current popular detection models on the COCO dataset, the designed attention mechanism module can capture contextual information well, improve detection accuracy, and use sepc network to help balance abstract and detailed information, and reduce the problem of semantic gap in the feature pyramid network. Whether it is anchor-based network model YOLOv3, Faster RCNN, or anchor-free network model Foveabox, FSAF, FCOS. Our optimal model can get 39.5% COCO AP under the background of ResNet50.\n",
      "We apply reinforcement learning to video compressive sensing to adapt the compression ratio. Specifically, video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI), which captures high-speed video using a low-speed camera is considered in this work, in which multiple (B) video frames can be reconstructed from a snapshot measurement. One research gap in previous studies is how to adapt B in the video SCI system for different scenes. In this paper, we fill this gap utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). An RL model, as well as various convolutional neural networks for reconstruction, are learned to achieve adaptive sensing of video SCI systems. Furthermore, the performance of an object detection network using directly the video SCI measurements without reconstruction is also used to perform RL-based adaptive video compressive sensing. Our proposed adaptive SCI method can thus be implemented in low cost and real time. Our work takes the technology one step further towards real applications of video SCI.\n",
      "We introduce WyPR, a Weakly-supervised framework for Point cloud Recognition, requiring only scene-level class tags as supervision. WyPR jointly addresses three core 3D recognition tasks: point-level semantic segmentation, 3D proposal generation, and 3D object detection, coupling their predictions through self and cross-task consistency losses. We show that in conjunction with standard multiple-instance learning objectives, WyPR can detect and segment objects in point cloud data without access to any spatial labels at training time. We demonstrate its efficacy using the ScanNet and S3DIS datasets, outperforming prior state of the art on weakly-supervised segmentation by more than 6% mIoU. In addition, we set up the first benchmark for weakly-supervised 3D object detection on both datasets, where WyPR outperforms standard approaches and establishes strong baselines for future work.\n"

      "Humans have a natural instinct to identify unknown object instances in their environments. The intrinsic curiosity about these unknown instances aids in learning about them, when the corresponding knowledge is eventually available. This motivates us to propose a novel computer vision problem called: `Open World Object Detection', where a model is tasked to: 1) identify objects that have not been introduced to it as `unknown', without explicit supervision to do so, and 2) incrementally learn these identified unknown categories without forgetting previously learned classes, when the corresponding labels are progressively received. We formulate the problem, introduce a strong evaluation protocol and provide a novel solution, which we call ORE: Open World Object Detector, based on contrastive clustering and energy based unknown identification. Our experimental evaluation and ablation studies analyze the efficacy of ORE in achieving Open World objectives. As an interesting by-product, we find that identifying and characterizing unknown instances helps to reduce confusion in an incremental object detection setting, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance, with no extra methodological effort. We hope that our work will attract further research into this newly identified, yet crucial research direction.\n",
      "Boundary discontinuity and its inconsistency to the final detection metric have been the bottleneck for rotating detection regression loss design. In this paper, we propose a novel regression loss based on Gaussian Wasserstein distance as a fundamental approach to solve the problem. Specifically, the rotated bounding box is converted to a 2-D Gaussian distribution, which enables to approximate the indifferentiable rotational IoU induced loss by the Gaussian Wasserstein distance (GWD) which can be learned efficiently by gradient back-propagation. GWD can still be informative for learning even there is no overlapping between two rotating bounding boxes which is often the case for small object detection. Thanks to its three unique properties, GWD can also elegantly solve the boundary discontinuity and square-like problem regardless how the bounding box is defined. Experiments on five datasets using different detectors show the effectiveness of our approach. Codes are available at https://github.com/yangxue0827/RotationDetection.\n",
      "Microorganisms play a vital role in human life. Therefore, microorganism detection is of great significance to human beings. However, the traditional manual microscopic detection methods have the disadvantages of long detection cycle, low detection accuracy in large orders, and great difficulty in detecting uncommon microorganisms. Therefore, it is meaningful to apply computer image analysis technology to the field of microorganism detection. Computer image analysis can realize high-precision and high-efficiency detection of microorganisms. In this review, first,we analyse the existing microorganism detection methods in chronological order, from traditional image processing and traditional machine learning to deep learning methods. Then, we analyze and summarize these existing methods and introduce some potential methods, including visual transformers. In the end, the future development direction and challenges of microorganism detection are discussed. In general, we have summarized 137 related technical papers from 1985 to the present. This review will help researchers have a more comprehensive understanding of the development process, research status, and future trends in the field of microorganism detection and provide a reference for researchers in other fields.\n",
      "Despite recent advances in object detection using deep learning neural networks, these neural networks still struggle to identify objects in art images such as paintings and drawings. This challenge is known as the cross depiction problem and it stems in part from the tendency of neural networks to prioritize identification of an object's texture over its shape. In this paper we propose and evaluate a process for training neural networks to localize objects - specifically people - in art images. We generate a large dataset for training and validation by modifying the images in the COCO dataset using AdaIn style transfer. This dataset is used to fine-tune a Faster R-CNN object detection network, which is then tested on the existing People-Art testing dataset. The result is a significant improvement on the state of the art and a new way forward for creating datasets to train neural networks to process art images.\n",
      "Steel pipes are widely used in high-risk and high-pressure scenarios such as oil, chemical, natural gas, shale gas, etc. If there is some defect in steel pipes, it will lead to serious adverse consequences. Applying object detection in the field of deep learning to pipe weld defect detection and identification can effectively improve inspection efficiency and promote the development of industrial automation. Most predecessors used traditional computer vision methods applied to detect defects of steel pipe weld seams. However, traditional computer vision methods rely on prior knowledge and can only detect defects with a single feature, so it is difficult to complete the task of multi-defect classification, while deep learning is end-to-end. In this paper, the state-of-the-art single-stage object detection algorithm YOLOv5 is proposed to be applied to the field of steel pipe weld defect detection, and compared with the two-stage representative object detection algorithm Faster R-CNN. The experimental results show that applying YOLOv5 to steel pipe weld defect detection can greatly improve the accuracy, complete the multi-classification task, and meet the criteria of real-time detection.\n",
      "Zero-shot image classification has made promising progress by training the aligned image and text encoders. The goal of this work is to advance zero-shot object detection, which aims to detect novel objects without bounding box nor mask annotations. We propose ViLD, a training method via Vision and Language knowledge Distillation. We distill the knowledge from a pre-trained zero-shot image classification model (e.g., CLIP) into a two-stage detector (e.g., Mask R-CNN). Our method aligns the region embeddings in the detector to the text and image embeddings inferred by the pre-trained model. We use the text embeddings as the detection classifier, obtained by feeding category names into the pre-trained text encoder. We then minimize the distance between the region embeddings and image embeddings, obtained by feeding region proposals into the pre-trained image encoder. During inference, we include text embeddings of novel categories into the detection classifier for zero-shot detection. We benchmark the performance on LVIS dataset by holding out all rare categories as novel categories. ViLD obtains 16.1 mask AP$_r$ with a Mask R-CNN (ResNet-50 FPN) for zero-shot detection, outperforming the supervised counterpart by 3.8. The model can directly transfer to other datasets, achieving 72.2 AP$_{50}$, 36.6 AP and 11.8 AP on PASCAL VOC, COCO and Objects365, respectively.\n",
      "Synthetic data generation has become essential in last years for feeding data-driven algorithms, which surpassed traditional techniques performance in almost every computer vision problem. Gathering and labelling the amount of data needed for these data-hungry models in the real world may become unfeasible and error-prone, while synthetic data give us the possibility of generating huge amounts of data with pixel-perfect annotations. However, most synthetic datasets lack from enough realism in their rendered images. In that context UnrealROX generation tool was presented in 2019, allowing to generate highly realistic data, at high resolutions and framerates, with an efficient pipeline based on Unreal Engine, a cutting-edge videogame engine. UnrealROX enabled robotic vision researchers to generate realistic and visually plausible data with full ground truth for a wide variety of problems such as class and instance semantic segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, visual grasping, and navigation. Nevertheless, its workflow was very tied to generate image sequences from a robotic on-board camera, making hard to generate data for other purposes. In this work, we present UnrealROX+, an improved version of UnrealROX where its decoupled and easy-to-use data acquisition system allows to quickly design and generate data in a much more flexible and customizable way. Moreover, it is packaged as an Unreal plug-in, which makes it more comfortable to use with already existing Unreal projects, and it also includes new features such as generating albedo or a Python API for interacting with the virtual environment from Deep Learning frameworks.\n",
      "Object detection is one of the fundamental objectives in Applied Computer Vision. In some of the applications, object detection becomes very challenging such as in the case of satellite image processing. Satellite image processing has remained the focus of researchers in domains of Precision Agriculture, Climate Change, Disaster Management, etc. Therefore, object detection in satellite imagery is one of the most researched problems in this domain. This paper focuses on aircraft detection. in satellite imagery using deep learning techniques. In this paper, we used YOLO deep learning framework for aircraft detection. This method uses satellite images collected by different sources as learning for the model to perform detection. Object detection in satellite images is mostly complex because objects have many variations, types, poses, sizes, complex and dense background. YOLO has some limitations for small size objects (less than$\\sim$32 pixels per object), therefore we upsample the prediction grid to reduce the coarseness of the model and to accurately detect the densely clustered objects. The improved model shows good accuracy and performance on different unknown images having small, rotating, and dense objects to meet the requirements in real-time.\n",
      "Recent works in video prediction have mainly focused on passive forecasting and low-level action-conditional prediction, which sidesteps the learning of interaction between agents and objects. We introduce the task of semantic action-conditional video prediction, which uses semantic action labels to describe those interactions and can be regarded as an inverse problem of action recognition. The challenge of this new task primarily lies in how to effectively inform the model of semantic action information. To bridge vision and language, we utilize the idea of capsule and propose a novel video prediction model, Modular Action Capsule Network (MAC). Our method is evaluated on two newly designed synthetic datasets, CLEVR-Building-Blocks and Sapien-Kitchen, and one real-world dataset called TowerCreation. Experiments show that given different action labels, MAC can correctly condition on instructions and generate corresponding future frames without need of bounding boxes. We further demonstrate that the trained model can make out-of-distribution generalization, be quickly adapted to new object categories and exploit its learnt features for object detection, showing the progression towards higher-level cognitive abilities.\n",
      "It is counter-intuitive that multi-modality methods based on point cloud and images perform only marginally better or sometimes worse than approaches that solely use point cloud. This paper investigates the reason behind this phenomenon. Due to the fact that multi-modality data augmentation must maintain consistency between point cloud and images, recent methods in this field typically use relatively insufficient data augmentation. This shortage makes their performance under expectation. Therefore, we contribute a pipeline, named transformation flow, to bridge the gap between single and multi-modality data augmentation with transformation reversing and replaying. In addition, considering occlusions, a point in different modalities may be occupied by different objects, making augmentations such as cut and paste non-trivial for multi-modality detection. We further present Multi-mOdality Cut and pAste (MoCa), which simultaneously considers occlusion and physical plausibility to maintain the multi-modality consistency. Without using ensemble of detectors, our multi-modality detector achieves new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset and competitive performance on KITTI 3D benchmark. Our method also wins the best PKL award in the 3rd nuScenes detection challenge. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d.\n",
      "How should representations from complementary sensors be integrated for autonomous driving? Geometry-based sensor fusion has shown great promise for perception tasks such as object detection and motion forecasting. However, for the actual driving task, the global context of the 3D scene is key, e.g. a change in traffic light state can affect the behavior of a vehicle geometrically distant from that traffic light. Geometry alone may therefore be insufficient for effectively fusing representations in end-to-end driving models. In this work, we demonstrate that imitation learning policies based on existing sensor fusion methods under-perform in the presence of a high density of dynamic agents and complex scenarios, which require global contextual reasoning, such as handling traffic oncoming from multiple directions at uncontrolled intersections. Therefore, we propose TransFuser, a novel Multi-Modal Fusion Transformer, to integrate image and LiDAR representations using attention. We experimentally validate the efficacy of our approach in urban settings involving complex scenarios using the CARLA urban driving simulator. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art driving performance while reducing collisions by 76% compared to geometry-based fusion.\n",

Our solution is based on mmdetction of a strong baseline open-source detection toolbox. Firstly, we introduce an effective data augmentation method to address the lack of data problem, which contains bbox-jitter, grid-mask, and mix-up. Secondly, we present a robust region of interest (ROI) extraction method to learn more significant ROI features via embedding global context features. Thirdly, we propose a multi-model integration strategy to refinement the prediction box, which weighted boxes fusion (WBF). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the average precision (AP) of object detection on the subset of the COCO2017 dataset.\n",
      "Searching for small objects in large images is a task that is both challenging for current deep learning systems and important in numerous real-world applications, such as remote sensing and medical imaging. Thorough scanning of very large images is computationally expensive, particularly at resolutions sufficient to capture small objects. The smaller an object of interest, the more likely it is to be obscured by clutter or otherwise deemed insignificant. We examine these issues in the context of two complementary problems: closed-set object detection and open-set target search. First, we present a method for predicting pixel-level objectness from a low resolution gist image, which we then use to select regions for performing object detection locally at high resolution. This approach has the benefit of not being fixed to a predetermined grid, thereby requiring fewer costly high-resolution glimpses than existing methods. Second, we propose a novel strategy for open-set visual search that seeks to find all instances of a target class which may be previously unseen and is defined by a single image. We interpret both detection problems through a probabilistic, Bayesian lens, whereby the objectness maps produced by our method serve as priors in a maximum-a-posteriori approach to the detection step. We evaluate the end-to-end performance of both the combination of our patch selection strategy with this target search approach and the combination of our patch selection strategy with standard object detection methods. Both elements of our approach are seen to significantly outperform baseline strategies.\n",
      "Object detection has been one of the most active topics in computer vision for the past years. Recent works have mainly focused on pushing the state-of-the-art in the general-purpose COCO benchmark. However, the use of such detection frameworks in specific applications such as autonomous driving is yet an area to be addressed. This study presents an enhanced 2D object detector based on Faster R-CNN that is better suited for the context of autonomous vehicles. Two main aspects are improved: the anchor generation procedure and the performance drop in minority classes. The default uniform anchor configuration is not suitable in this scenario due to the perspective projection of the vehicle cameras. Therefore, we propose a perspective-aware methodology that divides the image into key regions via clustering and uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize the base anchors for each of them. Furthermore, we add a module that enhances the precision of the second-stage header network by including the spatial information of the candidate regions proposed in the first stage. We also explore different re-weighting strategies to address the foreground-foreground class imbalance, showing that the use of a reduced version of focal loss can significantly improve the detection of difficult and underrepresented objects in two-stage detectors. Finally, we design an ensemble model to combine the strengths of the different learning strategies. Our proposal is evaluated with the Waymo Open Dataset, which is the most extensive and diverse up to date. The results demonstrate an average accuracy improvement of 6.13% mAP when using the best single model, and of 9.69% mAP with the ensemble. The proposed modifications over the Faster R-CNN do not increase computational cost and can easily be extended to optimize other anchor-based detection frameworks.\n",
      "This paper presents a model architecture for encoding the representations of part-whole hierarchies in images in form of a graph. The idea is to divide the image into patches of different levels and then treat all of these patches as nodes for a fully connected graph. A dynamic feature extraction module is used to extract feature representations from these patches in each graph iteration. This enables us to learn a rich graph representation of the image that encompasses the inherent part-whole hierarchical information. Utilizing proper self-supervised training techniques, such a model can be trained as a general purpose vision encoder model which can then be used for various vision related downstream tasks (e.g., Image Classification, Object Detection, Image Captioning, etc.).\n",
      "Video Captioning is considered to be one of the most challenging problems in the field of computer vision. Video Captioning involves the combination of different deep learning models to perform object detection, action detection, and localization by processing a sequence of image frames. It is crucial to consider the sequence of actions in a video in order to generate a meaningful description of the overall action event. A reliable, accurate, and real-time video captioning method can be used in many applications. However, this paper focuses on one application: video captioning for fostering and facilitating physical activities. In broad terms, the work can be considered to be assistive technology. Lack of physical activity appears to be increasingly widespread in many nations due to many factors, the most important being the convenience that technology has provided in workplaces. The adopted sedentary lifestyle is becoming a significant public health issue. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate more physical movements into our daily lives. Tracking one's daily physical activities would offer a base for comparison with activities performed in subsequent days. With the above in mind, this paper proposes a video captioning framework that aims to describe the activities in a video and estimate a person's daily physical activity level. This framework could potentially help people trace their daily movements to reduce an inactive lifestyle's health risks. The work presented in this paper is still in its infancy. The initial steps of the application are outlined in this paper. Based on our preliminary research, this project has great merit.\n",
      "Despite the substantial progress of active learning for image recognition, there still lacks an instance-level active learning method specified for object detection. In this paper, we propose Multiple Instance Active Object Detection (MI-AOD), to select the most informative images for detector training by observing instance-level uncertainty. MI-AOD defines an instance uncertainty learning module, which leverages the discrepancy of two adversarial instance classifiers trained on the labeled set to predict instance uncertainty of the unlabeled set. MI-AOD treats unlabeled images as instance bags and feature anchors in images as instances, and estimates the image uncertainty by re-weighting instances in a multiple instance learning (MIL) fashion. Iterative instance uncertainty learning and re-weighting facilitate suppressing noisy instances, toward bridging the gap between instance uncertainty and image-level uncertainty. Experiments validate that MI-AOD sets a solid baseline for instance-level active learning. On commonly used object detection datasets, MI-AOD outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant margins, particularly when the labeled sets are small. Code is available at https://github.com/yuantn/MI-AOD.\n",
      "Visual relationship detection aims to reason over relationships among salient objects in images, which has drawn increasing attention over the past few years. Inspired by human reasoning mechanisms, it is believed that external visual commonsense knowledge is beneficial for reasoning visual relationships of objects in images, which is however rarely considered in existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Relational Visual-Linguistic Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (RVL-BERT), which performs relational reasoning with both visual and language commonsense knowledge learned via self-supervised pre-training with multimodal representations. RVL-BERT also uses an effective spatial module and a novel mask attention module to explicitly capture spatial information among the objects. Moreover, our model decouples object detection from visual relationship recognition by taking in object names directly, enabling it to be used on top of any object detection system. We show through quantitative and qualitative experiments that, with the transferred knowledge and novel modules, RVL-BERT achieves competitive results on two challenging visual relationship detection datasets.

      "Deployed into an open world, object detectors are prone to a type of false positive detection termed open-set errors. We propose GMM-Det, a real-time method for extracting epistemic uncertainty from object detectors to identify and reject open-set errors. GMM-Det trains the detector to produce a structured logit space that is modelled with class-specific Gaussian Mixture Models. At test time, open-set errors are identified by their low log-probability under all Gaussian Mixture Models. We test two common detector architectures, Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet, across three varied datasets spanning robotics and computer vision. Our results show that GMM-Det consistently outperforms existing uncertainty techniques for identifying and rejecting open-set detections, especially at the low-error-rate operating point required for safety-critical applications. GMM-Det maintains object detection performance, and introduces only minimal computational overhead. We also introduce a methodology for converting existing object detection datasets into specific open-set datasets to consistently evaluate open-set performance in object detection. Code for GMM-Det and the dataset methodology will be made publicly available.\n",
      "Inspired by two basic mechanisms in animal visual systems, we introduce a feature transform technique that imposes invariance properties in the training of deep neural networks. The resulting algorithm requires less parameter tuning, trains well with an initial learning rate 1.0, and easily generalizes to different tasks. We enforce scale invariance with local statistics in the data to align similar samples generated in diverse situations. To accelerate convergence, we enforce a GL(n)-invariance property with global statistics extracted from a batch that the gradient descent solution should remain invariant under basis change. Tested on ImageNet, MS COCO, and Cityscapes datasets, our proposed technique requires fewer iterations to train, surpasses all baselines by a large margin, seamlessly works on both small and large batch size training, and applies to different computer vision tasks of image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.\n",
      "Despite the recent success of deep neural networks, it remains challenging to effectively model the long-tail class distribution in visual recognition tasks. To address this problem, we first investigate the performance bottleneck of the two-stage learning framework via ablative study. Motivated by our discovery, we propose a unified distribution alignment strategy for long-tail visual recognition. Specifically, we develop an adaptive calibration function that enables us to adjust the classification scores for each data point. We then introduce a generalized re-weight method in the two-stage learning to balance the class prior, which provides a flexible and unified solution to diverse scenarios in visual recognition tasks. We validate our method by extensive experiments on four tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results across all four recognition tasks with a simple and unified framework.

      "We propose a universal building block of Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) to improve the performance without any inference-time costs. The block is named Diverse Branch Block (DBB), which enhances the representational capacity of a single convolution by combining diverse branches of different scales and complexities to enrich the feature space, including sequences of convolutions, multi-scale convolutions, and average pooling. After training, a DBB can be equivalently converted into a single conv layer for deployment. Unlike the advancements of novel ConvNet architectures, DBB complicates the training-time microstructure while maintaining the macro architecture, so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for regular conv layers of any architecture. In this way, the model can be trained to reach a higher level of performance and then transformed into the original inference-time structure for inference. DBB improves ConvNets on image classification (up to 1.9% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet), object detection and semantic segmentation. The PyTorch code and models are released at https://github.com/DingXiaoH/DiverseBranchBlock.\n",
      "Passive methods for object detection and segmentation treat images of the same scene as individual samples and do not exploit object permanence across multiple views. Generalization to novel or difficult viewpoints thus requires additional training with lots of annotations. In contrast, humans often recognize objects by simply moving around, to get more informative viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a method for improving object detection in testing environments, assuming nothing but an embodied agent with a pre-trained 2D object detector. Our agent collects multi-view data, generates 2D and 3D pseudo-labels, and fine-tunes its detector in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that (1) our method obtains high-quality 2D and 3D pseudo-labels from multi-view RGB-D data; (2) fine-tuning with these pseudo-labels improves the 2D detector significantly in the test environment; (3) training a 3D detector with our pseudo-labels outperforms a prior self-supervised method by a large margin; (4) given weak supervision, our method can generate better pseudo-labels for novel objects.\n",
      "Neural network architecture design mostly focuses on the new convolutional operator or special topological structure of network block, little attention is drawn to the configuration of stacking each block, called Block Stacking Style (BSS). Recent studies show that BSS may also have an unneglectable impact on networks, thus we design an efficient algorithm to search it automatically. The proposed method, AutoBSS, is a novel AutoML algorithm based on Bayesian optimization by iteratively refining and clustering Block Stacking Style Code (BSSC), which can find optimal BSS in a few trials without biased evaluation. On ImageNet classification task, ResNet50/MobileNetV2/EfficientNet-B0 with our searched BSS achieve 79.29%/74.5%/77.79%, which outperform the original baselines by a large margin. More importantly, experimental results on model compression, object detection and instance segmentation show the strong generalizability of the proposed AutoBSS, and further verify the unneglectable impact of BSS on neural networks.\n",
      "Arbitrary-oriented object detection has been a building block for rotation sensitive tasks. We first show that the problem of discontinuous boundaries suffered in existing dominant regression-based rotation detectors, is caused by angular periodicity or corner ordering, according to the parameterization protocol. We also show that the root cause is that the ideal predictions can be out of the defined range. Accordingly, we transform the angular prediction task from a regression problem to a classification one. For the resulting circularly distributed angle classification problem, we first devise a Circular Smooth Label (CSL) technique to handle the periodicity of angle and increase the error tolerance to adjacent angles. To reduce the excessive model parameters by CSL, we further design a Gray Coded Label (GCL), which greatly reduces the length of the encoding. Finally, we further develop an object heading detection module, which can be useful when the exact heading orientation information is needed e.g. for ship and plane heading detection. We release our OHD-SJTU dataset and OHDet detector for heading detection. Results on three large-scale public datasets for aerial images i.e. DOTA, HRSC2016, OHD-SJTU, as well as scene text dataset ICDAR2015 and MLT, show the effectiveness of our approach.\n",
      "Mainstream object detectors based on the fully convolutional network has achieved impressive performance. While most of them still need a hand-designed non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing, which impedes fully end-to-end training. In this paper, we give the analysis of discarding NMS, where the results reveal that a proper label assignment plays a crucial role. To this end, for fully convolutional detectors, we introduce a Prediction-aware One-To-One (POTO) label assignment for classification to enable end-to-end detection, which obtains comparable performance with NMS. Besides, a simple 3D Max Filtering (3DMF) is proposed to utilize the multi-scale features and improve the discriminability of convolutions in the local region. With these techniques, our end-to-end framework achieves competitive performance against many state-of-the-art detectors with NMS on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/DeFCN .\n",
      "Active learning aims to improve the performance of task model by selecting the most informative samples with a limited budget. Unlike most recent works that focused on applying active learning for image classification, we propose an effective Consistency-based Active Learning method for object Detection (CALD), which fully explores the consistency between original and augmented data. CALD has three appealing benefits. (i) CALD is systematically designed by investigating the weaknesses of existing active learning methods, which do not take the unique challenges of object detection into account. (ii) CALD unifies box regression and classification with a single metric, which is not concerned by active learning methods for classification. CALD also focuses on the most informative local region rather than the whole image, which is beneficial for object detection. (iii) CALD not only gauges individual information for sample selection, but also leverages mutual information to encourage a balanced data distribution. Extensive experiments show that CALD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art task-agnostic and detection-specific active learning methods on general object detection datasets. Based on the Faster R-CNN detector, CALD consistently surpasses the baseline method (random selection) by 2.9/2.8/0.8 mAP on average on PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, and MS COCO. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/we1pingyu/CALD}\n",
      "Numerous improvements for feedback mechanisms have contributed to the great progress in object detection. In this paper, we first present an evaluation-feedback module, which is proposed to consist of evaluation system and feedback mechanism. Then we analyze and summarize the disadvantages and improvements of traditional evaluation-feedback module. Finally, we focus on both the evaluation system and the feedback mechanism, and propose Control Distance IoU and Control Distance IoU loss function (or CDIoU and CDIoU loss for short) without increasing parameters or FLOPs in models, which show different significant enhancements on several classical and emerging models. Some experiments and comparative tests show that coordinated evaluation-feedback module can effectively improve model performance. CDIoU and CDIoU loss have different excellent performances in several models such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4, RetinaNet and ATSS. There is a maximum AP improvement of 1.9% and an average AP of 0.8% improvement on MS COCO dataset, compared to traditional evaluation-feedback modules.\n",
      "Supervised learning based object detection frameworks demand plenty of laborious manual annotations, which may not be practical in real applications. Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) can effectively leverage unlabeled data to improve the model performance, which is of great significance for the application of object detection models. In this paper, we revisit SSOD and propose Instant-Teaching, a completely end-to-end and effective SSOD framework, which uses instant pseudo labeling with extended weak-strong data augmentations for teaching during each training iteration. To alleviate the confirmation bias problem and improve the quality of pseudo annotations, we further propose a co-rectify scheme based on Instant-Teaching, denoted as Instant-Teaching$^*$. Extensive experiments on both MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets substantiate the superiority of our framework. Specifically, our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 4.2 mAP on MS-COCO when using $2\\%$ labeled data. Even with full supervised information of MS-COCO, the proposed method still outperforms state-of-the-art methods by about 1.0 mAP. On PASCAL VOC, we can achieve more than 5 mAP improvement by applying VOC07 as labeled data and VOC12 as unlabeled data.\n",
      "By definition, object detection requires a multi-task loss in order to solve classification and regression tasks simultaneously. However, loss weight tends to be set manually in actuality. Therefore, a very practical problem that has not been studied so far arises: how to quickly find the loss weight that fits the current loss functions. In addition, when we choose different regression loss functions, whether the loss weight need to be adjusted and if so, how should it be adjusted still is a problem demanding prompt solution. In this paper, through experiments and theoretical analysis of prediction box shifting, we firstly find out three important conclusions about optimal loss weight allocation strategy, including (1) the classification loss curve decays faster than regression loss curve; (2) loss weight is less than 1; (3) the gap between classification and regression loss weight should not be too large. Then, based on the above conclusions, we propose an Adaptive Loss Weight Adjustment(ALWA) to solve the above two problems by dynamically adjusting the loss weight in the training process, according to statistical characteristics of loss values. By incorporating ALWA into both one-stage and two-stage object detectors, we show a consistent improvement on their performance using L1, SmoothL1 and CIoU loss, performance measures on popular object detection benchmarks including PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. The code is available at https://github.com/ywx-hub/ALWA.\n",
      "Digital twins are meant to bridge the gap between real-world physical systems and virtual representations. Both stand-alone and descriptive digital twins incorporate 3D geometric models, which are the physical representations of objects in the digital replica. Digital twin applications are required to rapidly update internal parameters with the evolution of their physical counterpart. Due to an essential need for having high-quality geometric models for accurate physical representations, the storage and bandwidth requirements for storing 3D model information can quickly exceed the available storage and bandwidth capacity. In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to geometric change detection in the context of a digital twin. We address the issue through a combined solution of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for motion detection, YOLOv5 for object detection, and 3D machine learning for pose estimation. DMD is applied for background subtraction, enabling detection of moving foreground objects in real-time. The video frames containing detected motion are extracted and used as input to the change detection network. The object detection algorithm YOLOv5 is applied to extract the bounding boxes of detected objects in the video frames. Furthermore, the rotational pose of each object is estimated in a 3D pose estimation network. A series of convolutional neural networks conducts feature extraction from images and 3D model shapes. Then, the network outputs the estimated Euler angles of the camera orientation with respect to the object in the input image. By only storing data associated with a detected change in pose, we minimize necessary storage and bandwidth requirements while still being able to recreate the 3D scene on demand.\n",
      "Despite the remarkable accuracy of deep neural networks in object detection, they are costly to train and scale due to supervision requirements. Particularly, learning more object categories typically requires proportionally more bounding box annotations. Weakly supervised and zero-shot learning techniques have been explored to scale object detectors to more categories with less supervision, but they have not been as successful and widely adopted as supervised models. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation of the object detection problem, namely open-vocabulary object detection, which is more general, more practical, and more effective than weakly supervised and zero-shot approaches. We propose a new method to train object detectors using bounding box annotations for a limited set of object categories, as well as image-caption pairs that cover a larger variety of objects at a significantly lower cost. We show that the proposed method can detect and localize objects for which no bounding box annotation is provided during training, at a significantly higher accuracy than zero-shot approaches. Meanwhile, objects with bounding box annotation can be detected almost as accurately as supervised methods, which is significantly better than weakly supervised baselines. Accordingly, we establish a new state of the art for scalable object detection.\n",
      "Object recognition is a fundamental problem in many video processing tasks, accurately locating seen objects at low computation cost paves the way for on-device video recognition. We propose PatchNet, an efficient convolutional neural network to match objects in adjacent video frames. It learns the patchwise correlation features instead of pixel features. PatchNet is very compact, running at just 58MFLOPs, $5\\times$ simpler than MobileNetV2. We demonstrate its application on two tasks, video object detection and visual object tracking. On ImageNet VID, PatchNet reduces the flops of R-FCN ResNet-101 by 5x and EfficientDet-D0 by 3.4x with less than 1% mAP loss. On OTB2015, PatchNet reduces SiamFC and SiamRPN by 2.5x with no accuracy loss. Experiments on Jetson Nano further demonstrate 2.8x to 4.3x speed-ups associated with flops reduction. Code is open sourced at https://github.com/RalphMao/PatchNet.\n",
      "This paper presents a detailed study of improving visual representations for vision language (VL) tasks and develops an improved object detection model to provide object-centric representations of images. Compared to the most widely used \\emph{bottom-up and top-down} model \\cite{anderson2018bottom}, the new model is bigger, better-designed for VL tasks, and pre-trained on much larger training corpora that combine multiple public annotated object detection datasets. Therefore, it can generate representations of a richer collection of visual objects and concepts. While previous VL research focuses mainly on improving the vision-language fusion model and leaves the object detection model improvement untouched, we show that visual features matter significantly in VL models. In our experiments we feed the visual features generated by the new object detection model into a Transformer-based VL fusion model \\oscar \\cite{li2020oscar}, and utilize an improved approach \\short\\ to pre-train the VL model and fine-tune it on a wide range of downstream VL tasks. Our results show that the new visual features significantly improve the performance across all VL tasks, creating new state-of-the-art results on seven public benchmarks. We will release the new object detection model to public.\n",
      "Multiclass classifiers are often designed and evaluated only on a sample from the classes on which they will eventually be applied. Hence, their final accuracy remains unknown. In this work we study how a classifier's performance over the initial class sample can be used to extrapolate its expected accuracy on a larger, unobserved set of classes. For this, we define a measure of separation between correct and incorrect classes that is independent of the number of classes: the \"reversed ROC\" (rROC), which is obtained by replacing the roles of classes and data-points in the common ROC. We show that the classification accuracy is a function of the rROC in multiclass classifiers, for which the learned representation of data from the initial class sample remains unchanged when new classes are added. Using these results we formulate a robust neural-network-based algorithm, \"CleaneX\", which learns to estimate the accuracy of such classifiers on arbitrarily large sets of classes. Unlike previous methods, our method uses both the observed accuracies of the classifier and densities of classification scores, and therefore achieves remarkably better predictions than current state-of-the-art methods on both simulations and real datasets of object detection, face recognition, and brain decoding.\n",
      "3D object detection is an important task, especially in the autonomous driving application domain. However, it is challenging to support the real-time performance with the limited computation and memory resources on edge-computing devices in self-driving cars. To achieve this, we propose a compiler-aware unified framework incorporating network enhancement and pruning search with the reinforcement learning techniques, to enable real-time inference of 3D object detection on the resource-limited edge-computing devices. Specifically, a generator Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is employed to provide the unified scheme for both network enhancement and pruning search automatically, without human expertise and assistance. And the evaluated performance of the unified schemes can be fed back to train the generator RNN. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework firstly achieves real-time 3D object detection on mobile devices (Samsung Galaxy S20 phone) with competitive detection performance.\n",
      "An increasing share of captured images and videos are transmitted for storage and remote analysis by computer vision algorithms, rather than to be viewed by humans. Contrary to traditional standard codecs with engineered tools, neural network based codecs can be trained end-to-end to optimally compress images with respect to a target rate and any given differentiable performance metric. Although it is possible to train such compression tools to achieve better rate-accuracy performance for a particular computer vision task, it could be practical and relevant to re-use the compressed bit-stream for multiple machine tasks. For this purpose, we introduce 'Connectors' that are inserted between the decoder and the task algorithms to enable a direct transformation of the compressed content, which was previously optimized for a specific task, to multiple other machine tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving significant rate-accuracy performance improvement for both image classification and object segmentation, using the same bit-stream, originally optimized for object detection.\n",
      "In precision crop protection, (target-orientated) object detection in image processing can help navigate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV, crop protection drones) to the right place to apply the pesticide. Unnecessary application of non-target areas could be avoided. Deep learning algorithms dominantly use in modern computer vision tasks which require high computing time, memory footprint, and power consumption. Based on the Edge Artificial Intelligence, we investigate the main three paths that lead to dealing with this problem, including hardware accelerators, efficient algorithms, and model compression. Finally, we integrate them and propose a solution based on a light deep neural network (DNN), called Ag-YOLO, which can make the crop protection UAV have the ability to target detection and autonomous operation. This solution is restricted in size, cost, flexible, fast, and energy-effective. The hardware is only 18 grams in weight and 1.5 watts in energy consumption, and the developed DNN model needs only 838 kilobytes of disc space. We tested the developed hardware and software in comparison to the tiny version of the state-of-art YOLOv3 framework, known as YOLOv3-Tiny to detect individual palm in a plantation. An average F1 score of 0.9205 at the speed of 36.5 frames per second (in comparison to similar accuracy at 18 frames per second and 8.66 megabytes of the YOLOv3-Tiny algorithm) was reached. This developed detection system is easily plugged into any machines already purchased as long as the machines have USB ports and run Linux Operating System.\n",
      "The objective of most Reinforcement Learning painting agents is to minimize the loss between a target image and the paint canvas. Human painter artistry emphasizes important features of the target image rather than simply reproducing it (DiPaola 2007). Using adversarial or L2 losses in the RL painting models, although its final output is generally a work of finesse, produces a stroke sequence that is vastly different from that which a human would produce since the model does not have knowledge about the abstract features in the target image. In order to increase the human-like planning of the model without the use of expensive human data, we introduce a new loss function for use with the model's reward function: Content Masked Loss. In the context of robot painting, Content Masked Loss employs an object detection model to extract features which are used to assign higher weight to regions of the canvas that a human would find important for recognizing content. The results, based on 332 human evaluators, show that the digital paintings produced by our Content Masked model show detectable subject matter earlier in the stroke sequence than existing methods without compromising on the quality of the final painting. Our code is available at https://github.com/pschaldenbrand/ContentMaskedLoss.\n",
      "Large datasets' availability is catalyzing a rapid expansion of deep learning in general and computer vision in particular. At the same time, in many domains, a sufficient amount of training data is lacking, which may become an obstacle to the practical application of computer vision techniques. This paper challenges small and imbalanced datasets based on the example of a plant phenomics domain. We introduce an image augmentation framework, which enables us to extremely enlarge the number of training samples while providing the data for such tasks as object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, object counting, image denoising, and classification. We prove that our augmentation method increases model performance when only a few training samples are available. In our experiment, we use the DeepLabV3 model on semantic segmentation tasks with Arabidopsis and Nicotiana tabacum image dataset. The obtained result shows a 9% relative increase in model performance compared to the basic image augmentation techniques.\n",

This paper provides an integrated review of two facets of AI and art: 1) AI is used for art analysis and employed on digitized artwork collections; 2) AI is used for creative purposes and generating novel artworks. In the context of AI-related research for art understanding, we present a comprehensive overview of artwork datasets and recent works that address a variety of tasks such as classification, object detection, similarity retrieval, multimodal representations, computational aesthetics, etc. In relation to the role of AI in creating art, we address various practical and theoretical aspects of AI Art and consolidate related works that deal with those topics in detail.

      "Joint damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is assessed by manually inspecting and grading radiographs of hands and feet. This is a tedious task which requires trained experts whose subjective assessment leads to low inter-rater agreement. An algorithm which can automatically predict the joint level damage in hands and feet can help optimize this process, which will eventually aid the doctors in better patient care and research. In this paper, we propose a two-staged approach which amalgamates object detection and convolution neural networks with attention which can efficiently and accurately predict the overall and joint level narrowing and erosion from patients radiographs. This approach has been evaluated on hands and feet radiographs of patients suffering from RA and has achieved a weighted root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.358 and 1.404 in predicting joint level narrowing and erosion Sharp van der Heijde (SvH) scores which is 31% and 19% improvement with respect to the baseline SvH scores, respectively. The proposed approach achieved a weighted absolute error of 1.456 in predicting the overall damage in hands and feet radiographs for the patients which is a 79% improvement as compared to the baseline. Our method also provides an inherent capability to provide explanations for model predictions using attention weights, which is essential given the black box nature of deep learning models. The proposed approach was developed during the RA2 Dream Challenge hosted by Dream Challenges and secured 4th and 8th position in predicting overall and joint level narrowing and erosion SvH scores from radiographs.\n",
      "Object Detection (OD) is an important computer vision problem for industry, which can be used for quality control in the production lines, among other applications. Recently, Deep Learning (DL) methods have enabled practitioners to train OD models performing well on complex real world images. However, the adoption of these models in industry is still limited by the difficulty and the significant cost of collecting high quality training datasets. On the other hand, when applying OD to the context of production lines, CAD models of the objects to be detected are often available. In this paper, we introduce a fully automated method that uses a CAD model of an object and returns a fully trained OD model for detecting this object. To do this, we created a Blender script that generates realistic labeled datasets of images containing the object, which are then used for training the OD model. The method is validated experimentally on two practical examples, showing that this approach can generate OD models performing well on real images, while being trained only on synthetic images. The proposed method has potential to facilitate the adoption of object detection models in industry as it is easy to adapt for new objects and highly flexible. Hence, it can result in significant costs reduction, gains in productivity and improved products quality.\n",
      "We present an efficient foveal framework to perform object detection. A scale normalized image pyramid (SNIP) is generated that, like human vision, only attends to objects within a fixed size range at different scales. Such a restriction of objects' size during training affords better learning of object-sensitive filters, and therefore, results in better accuracy. However, the use of an image pyramid increases the computational cost. Hence, we propose an efficient spatial sub-sampling scheme which only operates on fixed-size sub-regions likely to contain objects (as object locations are known during training). The resulting approach, referred to as Scale Normalized Image Pyramid with Efficient Resampling or SNIPER, yields up to 3 times speed-up during training. Unfortunately, as object locations are unknown during inference, the entire image pyramid still needs processing. To this end, we adopt a coarse-to-fine approach, and predict the locations and extent of object-like regions which will be processed in successive scales of the image pyramid. Intuitively, it's akin to our active human-vision that first skims over the field-of-view to spot interesting regions for further processing and only recognizes objects at the right resolution. The resulting algorithm is referred to as AutoFocus and results in a 2.5-5 times speed-up during inference when used with SNIP.\n",
      "Researches have demonstrated that low bit-width (e.g., INT8) quantization can be employed to accelerate the inference process. It makes the gradient quantization very promising since the backward propagation requires approximately twice more computation than forward one. Due to the variability and uncertainty of gradient distribution, a lot of methods have been proposed to attain training stability. However, most of them ignore the channel-wise gradient distributions and the impact of gradients with different magnitudes, resulting in the degradation of final accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel INT8 quantization training framework for convolutional neural network to address the above issues. Specifically, we adopt Gradient Vectorized Quantization to quantize the gradient, based on the observation that layer-wise gradients contain multiple distributions along the channel dimension. Then, Magnitude-aware Clipping Strategy is introduced by taking the magnitudes of gradients into consideration when minimizing the quantization error, and we present a theoretical derivation to solve the quantization parameters of different distributions. Experimental results on broad range of computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection and video classification, demonstrate that the proposed Distribution Adaptive INT8 Quantization training method has achieved almost lossless training accuracy for different backbones, including ResNet, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, VGG and AlexNet, which is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, we further implement the INT8 kernel that can accelerate the training iteration more than 200% under the latest Turing architecture, i.e., our method excels on both training accuracy and speed.\n",
      "Designing proper loss functions for vision tasks has been a long-standing research direction to advance the capability of existing models. For object detection, the well-established classification and regression loss functions have been carefully designed by considering diverse learning challenges. Inspired by the recent progress in network architecture search, it is interesting to explore the possibility of discovering new loss function formulations via directly searching the primitive operation combinations. So that the learned losses not only fit for diverse object detection challenges to alleviate huge human efforts, but also have better alignment with evaluation metric and good mathematical convergence property. Beyond the previous auto-loss works on face recognition and image classification, our work makes the first attempt to discover new loss functions for the challenging object detection from primitive operation levels. We propose an effective convergence-simulation driven evolutionary search algorithm, called CSE-Autoloss, for speeding up the search progress by regularizing the mathematical rationality of loss candidates via convergence property verification and model optimization simulation. CSE-Autoloss involves the search space that cover a wide range of the possible variants of existing losses and discovers best-searched loss function combination within a short time (around 1.5 wall-clock days). We conduct extensive evaluations of loss function search on popular detectors and validate the good generalization capability of searched losses across diverse architectures and datasets. Our experiments show that the best-discovered loss function combinations outperform default combinations by 1.1% and 0.8% in terms of mAP for two-stage and one-stage detectors on COCO respectively. Our searched losses are available at https://github.com/PerdonLiu/CSE-Autoloss.\n",

To train effectively on pseudo-labels,a powerful reID-like pretext task with consistency loss is constructed for model customization. Our evaluation shows that compared with legacy selftraining methods, MCSSL improves average mAP by 5.44% and 6.76% on WildTrack and CityFlow dataset, respectively.\n",
      "Recent breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) have led to the emergence of many intelligent mobile applications and services, but in the meanwhile also pose unprecedented computing challenges on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper builds a collaborative deep inference system between a resource-constrained mobile device and a powerful edge server, aiming at joining the power of both on-device processing and computation offloading. The basic idea of this system is to partition a deep neural network (DNN) into a front-end part running on the mobile device and a back-end part running on the edge server, with the key challenge being how to locate the optimal partition point to minimize the end-to-end inference delay. Unlike existing efforts on DNN partitioning that rely heavily on a dedicated offline profiling stage to search for the optimal partition point, our system has a built-in online learning module, called Autodidactic Neurosurgeon (ANS), to automatically learn the optimal partition point on-the-fly. Therefore, ANS is able to closely follow the changes of the system environment by generating new knowledge for adaptive decision making. The core of ANS is a novel contextual bandit learning algorithm, called $\\mu$LinUCB, which not only has provable theoretical learning performance guarantee but also is ultra-lightweight for easy real-world implementation. We implement our system on a video stream object detection testbed to validate the design of ANS and evaluate its performance. The experiments show that ANS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of tracking system changes and reducing the end-to-end inference delay.\n",
      "Attention mechanisms, which enable a neural network to accurately focus on all the relevant elements of the input, have become an essential component to improve the performance of deep neural networks. There are mainly two attention mechanisms widely used in computer vision studies, \\textit{spatial attention} and \\textit{channel attention}, which aim to capture the pixel-level pairwise relationship and channel dependency, respectively. Although fusing them together may achieve better performance than their individual implementations, it will inevitably increase the computational overhead. In this paper, we propose an efficient Shuffle Attention (SA) module to address this issue, which adopts Shuffle Units to combine two types of attention mechanisms effectively. Specifically, SA first groups channel dimensions into multiple sub-features before processing them in parallel. Then, for each sub-feature, SA utilizes a Shuffle Unit to depict feature dependencies in both spatial and channel dimensions. After that, all sub-features are aggregated and a \"channel shuffle\" operator is adopted to enable information communication between different sub-features. The proposed SA module is efficient yet effective, e.g., the parameters and computations of SA against the backbone ResNet50 are 300 vs. 25.56M and 2.76e-3 GFLOPs vs. 4.12 GFLOPs, respectively, and the performance boost is more than 1.34% in terms of Top-1 accuracy. Extensive experimental results on common-used benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for classification, MS COCO for object detection, and instance segmentation, demonstrate that the proposed SA outperforms the current SOTA methods significantly by achieving higher accuracy while having lower model complexity. The code and models are available at https://github.com/wofmanaf/SA-Net.\n",
      "The significant power of deep learning networks has led to enormous development in object detection. Over the last few years, object detector frameworks have achieved tremendous success in both accuracy and efficiency. However, their ability is far from that of human beings due to several factors, occlusion being one of them. Since occlusion can happen in various locations, scale, and ratio, it is very difficult to handle. In this paper, we address the challenges in occlusion handling in generic object detection in both outdoor and indoor scenes, then we refer to the recent works that have been carried out to overcome these challenges. Finally, we discuss some possible future directions of research.\n",
      "Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an integral part of any autonomous driving pipelines because itproduces trajectories which has been taken by other moving objects in the scene and helps predicttheir future motion. Thanks to the recent advances in 3D object detection enabled by deep learning,track-by-detection has become the dominant paradigm in 3D MOT. In this paradigm, a MOT systemis essentially made of an object detector and a data association algorithm which establishes track-to-detection correspondence. While 3D object detection has been actively researched, associationalgorithms for 3D MOT seem to settle at a bipartie matching formulated as a linear assignmentproblem (LAP) and solved by the Hungarian algorithm. In this paper, we adapt a two-stage dataassociation method which was successful in image-based tracking to the 3D setting, thus providingan alternative for data association for 3D MOT. Our method outperforms the baseline using one-stagebipartie matching for data association by achieving 0.587 AMOTA in NuScenes validation set.\n",
      "Affect is often expressed via non-verbal body language such as actions/gestures, which are vital indicators for human behaviors. Recent studies on recognition of fine-grained actions/gestures in monocular images have mainly focused on modeling spatial configuration of body parts representing body pose, human-objects interactions and variations in local appearance. The results show that this is a brittle approach since it relies on accurate body parts/objects detection. In this work, we argue that there exist local discriminative semantic regions, whose \"informativeness\" can be evaluated by the attention mechanism for inferring fine-grained gestures/actions. To this end, we propose a novel end-to-end \\textbf{Regional Attention Network (RAN)}, which is a fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to combine multiple contextual regions through attention mechanism, focusing on parts of the images that are most relevant to a given task. Our regions consist of one or more consecutive cells and are adapted from the strategies used in computing HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradient) descriptor. The model is extensively evaluated on ten datasets belonging to 3 different scenarios: 1) head pose recognition, 2) drivers state recognition, and 3) human action and facial expression recognition. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a considerable margin in different metrics.\n",
      "Objective: To assess the ability of imaging-based deep learning to predict radiographic patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) from knee lateral view radiographs.   Design: Knee lateral view radiographs were extracted from The Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) (n = 18,436 knees). Patellar region-of-interest (ROI) was first automatically detected, and subsequently, end-to-end deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained and validated to detect the status of patellofemoral OA. Patellar ROI was detected using deep-learning-based object detection method. Manual PFOA status assessment provided in the MOST dataset was used as a classification outcome for the CNNs. Performance of prediction models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and the average precision (AP) obtained from the precision-recall (PR) curve in the stratified 5-fold cross validation setting.   Results: Of the 18,436 knees, 3,425 (19%) had PFOA. AUC and AP for the reference model including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), the total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and tibiofemoral Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade to predict PFOA were 0.806 and 0.478, respectively. The CNN model that used only image data significantly improved the prediction of PFOA status (ROC AUC= 0.958, AP= 0.862).   Conclusion: We present the first machine learning based automatic PFOA detection method. Furthermore, our deep learning based model trained on patella region from knee lateral view radiographs performs better at predicting PFOA than models based on patient characteristics and clinical assessments.\n",
      "The remarkable advancements in Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have fueled enthusiasm for using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in almost every domain; however, the opaqueness of these algorithms put a question mark on their applications in safety-critical systems. In this regard, the `explainability' dimension is not only essential to both explain the inner workings of black-box algorithms, but it also adds accountability and transparency dimensions that are of prime importance for regulators, consumers, and service providers. eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is the set of techniques and methods to convert the so-called black-box AI algorithms to white-box algorithms, where the results achieved by these algorithms and the variables, parameters, and steps taken by the algorithm to reach the obtained results, are transparent and explainable. To complement the existing literature on XAI, in this paper, we take an `engineering' approach to illustrate the concepts of XAI. We discuss the stakeholders in XAI and describe the mathematical contours of XAI from engineering perspective. Then we take the autonomous car as a use-case and discuss the applications of XAI for its different components such as object detection, perception, control, action decision, and so on. This work is an exploratory study to identify new avenues of research in the field of XAI.\n",
      "The main topic of this paper is a brief overview of the field of Artificial Intelligence. The core of this paper is a practical implementation of an algorithm for object detection and tracking. The ability to detect and track fast-moving objects is crucial for various applications of Artificial Intelligence like autonomous driving, ball tracking in sports, robotics or object counting. As part of this paper the Fully Convolutional Neural Network \"CueNet\" was developed. It detects and tracks the cueball on a labyrinth game robustly and reliably. While CueNet V1 has a single input image, the approach with CueNet V2 was to take three consecutive 240 x 180-pixel images as an input and transform them into a probability heatmap for the cueball's location. The network was tested with a separate video that contained all sorts of distractions to test its robustness. When confronted with our testing data, CueNet V1 predicted the correct cueball location in 99.6% of all frames, while CueNet V2 had 99.8% accuracy.\n",
      "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a pivotal role in reduction of uncertainties during both optimization and decision making processes. It can be applied to solve a variety of real-world applications in science and engineering. Bayesian approximation and ensemble learning techniques are two most widely-used UQ methods in the literature. In this regard, researchers have proposed different UQ methods and examined their performance in a variety of applications such as computer vision (e.g., self-driving cars and object detection), image processing (e.g., image restoration), medical image analysis (e.g., medical image classification and segmentation), natural language processing (e.g., text classification, social media texts and recidivism risk-scoring), bioinformatics, etc. This study reviews recent advances in UQ methods used in deep learning. Moreover, we also investigate the application of these methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Then, we outline a few important applications of UQ methods. Finally, we briefly highlight the fundamental research challenges faced by UQ methods and discuss the future research directions in this field.\n",
      "Efficient and accurate object detection in video and image analysis is one of the major beneficiaries of the advancement in computer vision systems with the help of deep learning. With the aid of deep learning, more powerful tools evolved, which are capable to learn high-level and deeper features and thus can overcome the existing problems in traditional architectures of object detection algorithms. The work in this thesis aims to achieve high accuracy in object detection with good real-time performance.   In the area of computer vision, a lot of research is going into the area of detection and processing of visual information, by improving the existing algorithms. The binarized neural network has shown high performance in various vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST), Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), and Street View House Numbers (SVHN) datasets are used which is implemented using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that is 22 layers deep. Supervised learning is used in the work, which classifies the particular dataset with the proper structure of the model. In still images, to improve accuracy, Googlenet is used. The final layer of the Googlenet is replaced with the transfer learning to improve the accuracy of the Googlenet. At the same time, the accuracy in moving images can be maintained by transfer learning techniques. Hardware is the main backbone for any model to obtain faster results with a large number of datasets. Here, Nvidia Jetson Nano is used which is a graphics processing unit (GPU), that can handle a large number of computations in the process of object detection. Results show that the accuracy of objects detected by the transfer learning method is more when compared to the existing methods.\n",
      "Providing huge amounts of data is a fundamental demand when dealing with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Employing these algorithms to solve computer vision problems resulted in the advent of various image datasets to feed the most common visual imagery deep structures, known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this regard, some datasets can be found that contain hundreds or even thousands of images for license plate detection and optical character recognition purposes. However, no publicly available image dataset provides such data for the recognition of Farsi characters used in car license plates. The gap has to be filled due to the numerous advantages of developing accurate deep learning-based systems for law enforcement and surveillance purposes. This paper introduces a large-scale dataset that includes images of numbers and characters used in Iranian car license plates. The dataset, named Iranis, contains more than 83,000 images of Farsi numbers and letters collected from real-world license plate images captured by various cameras. The variety of instances in terms of camera shooting angle, illumination, resolution, and contrast make the dataset a proper choice for training DNNs. Dataset images are manually annotated for object detection and image classification. Finally, and to build a baseline for Farsi character recognition, the paper provides a performance analysis using a YOLO v.3 object detector.\n",
      "The rapid development and wide utilization of object detection techniques have aroused attention on both accuracy and speed of object detectors. However, the current state-of-the-art object detection works are either accuracy-oriented using a large model but leading to high latency or speed-oriented using a lightweight model but sacrificing accuracy. In this work, we propose YOLObile framework, a real-time object detection on mobile devices via compression-compilation co-design. A novel block-punched pruning scheme is proposed for any kernel size. To improve computational efficiency on mobile devices, a GPU-CPU collaborative scheme is adopted along with advanced compiler-assisted optimizations. Experimental results indicate that our pruning scheme achieves 14$\\times$ compression rate of YOLOv4 with 49.0 mAP. Under our YOLObile framework, we achieve 17 FPS inference speed using GPU on Samsung Galaxy S20. By incorporating our proposed GPU-CPU collaborative scheme, the inference speed is increased to 19.1 FPS, and outperforms the original YOLOv4 by 5$\\times$ speedup.

      "Recently, skeleton-based approaches have achieved rapid progress on the basis of great success in skeleton representation. Plenty of researches focus on solving specific problems according to skeleton features. Some skeleton-based approaches have been mentioned in several overviews on object detection as a non-essential part. Nevertheless, there has not been any thorough analysis of skeleton-based approaches attentively. Instead of describing these techniques in terms of theoretical constructs, we devote to summarizing skeleton-based approaches with regard to application fields and given tasks as comprehensively as possible. This paper is conducive to further understanding of skeleton-based application and dealing with particular issues.\n",
      "Transformers have become the dominant model in natural language processing, owing to their ability to pretrain on massive amounts of data, then transfer to smaller, more specific tasks via fine-tuning. The Vision Transformer was the first major attempt to apply a pure transformer model directly to images as input, demonstrating that as compared to convolutional networks, transformer-based architectures can achieve competitive results on benchmark classification tasks. However, the computational complexity of the attention operator means that we are limited to low-resolution inputs. For more complex tasks such as detection or segmentation, maintaining a high input resolution is crucial to ensure that models can properly identify and reflect fine details in their output. This naturally raises the question of whether or not transformer-based architectures such as the Vision Transformer are capable of performing tasks other than classification. In this paper, we determine that Vision Transformers can be used as a backbone by a common detection task head to produce competitive COCO results. The model that we propose, ViT-FRCNN, demonstrates several known properties associated with transformers, including large pretraining capacity and fast fine-tuning performance. We also investigate improvements over a standard detection backbone, including superior performance on out-of-domain images, better performance on large objects, and a lessened reliance on non-maximum suppression. We view ViT-FRCNN as an important stepping stone toward a pure-transformer solution of complex vision tasks such as object detection.\n",
      "Current neural networks-based object detection approaches processing LiDAR point clouds are generally trained from one kind of LiDAR sensors. However, their performances decrease when they are tested with data coming from a different LiDAR sensor than the one used for training, i.e., with a different point cloud resolution. In this paper, R-AGNO-RPN, a region proposal network built on fusion of 3D point clouds and RGB images is proposed for 3D object detection regardless of point cloud resolution. As our approach is designed to be also applied on low point cloud resolutions, the proposed method focuses on object localization instead of estimating refined boxes on reduced data. The resilience to low-resolution point cloud is obtained through image features accurately mapped to Bird's Eye View and a specific data augmentation procedure that improves the contribution of the RGB images. To show the proposed network's ability to deal with different point clouds resolutions, experiments are conducted on both data coming from the KITTI 3D Object Detection and the nuScenes datasets. In addition, to assess its performances, our method is compared to PointPillars, a well-known 3D detection network. Experimental results show that even on point cloud data reduced by $80\\%$ of its original points, our method is still able to deliver relevant proposals localization.\n",
      "This paper proposes a multi-sensor based approach to detect, track, and localize a quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Specifically, a pipeline is developed to process monocular RGB and thermal video (captured from a fixed platform) to detect and track the UAV in our FoV. Subsequently, a 2D planar lidar is used to allow conversion of pixel data to actual distance measurements, and thereby enable localization of the UAV in global coordinates. The monocular data is processed through a deep learning-based object detection method that computes an initial bounding box for the UAV. The thermal data is processed through a thresholding and Kalman filter approach to detect and track the bounding box. Training and testing data are prepared by combining a set of original experiments conducted in a motion capture environment and publicly available UAV image data. The new pipeline compares favorably to existing methods and demonstrates promising tracking and localization capacity of sample experiments.\n",
      "The Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) presents a remarkable approach to alleviate the scale variance in object representation by performing instance-level assignments. Nevertheless, this strategy ignores the distinct characteristics of different sub-regions in an instance. To this end, we propose a fine-grained dynamic head to conditionally select a pixel-level combination of FPN features from different scales for each instance, which further releases the ability of multi-scale feature representation. Moreover, we design a spatial gate with the new activation function to reduce computational complexity dramatically through spatially sparse convolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method on several state-of-the-art detection benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/StevenGrove/DynamicHead.\n",
      "The Learnable Tree Filter presents a remarkable approach to model structure-preserving relations for semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, the intrinsic geometric constraint forces it to focus on the regions with close spatial distance, hindering the effective long-range interactions. To relax the geometric constraint, we give the analysis by reformulating it as a Markov Random Field and introduce a learnable unary term. Besides, we propose a learnable spanning tree algorithm to replace the original non-differentiable one, which further improves the flexibility and robustness. With the above improvements, our method can better capture long-range dependencies and preserve structural details with linear complexity, which is extended to several vision tasks for more generic feature transform. Extensive experiments on object detection/instance segmentation demonstrate the consistent improvements over the original version. For semantic segmentation, we achieve leading performance (82.1% mIoU) on the Cityscapes benchmark without bells-and-whistles. Code is available at https://github.com/StevenGrove/LearnableTreeFilterV2.\n",
      "The recent advancement in computational and communication systems has led to the introduction of high-performing neural networks and high-speed wireless vehicular communication networks. As a result, new technologies such as cooperative perception and cognition have emerged, addressing the inherent limitations of sensory devices by providing solutions for the detection of partially occluded targets and expanding the sensing range. However, designing a reliable cooperative cognition or perception system requires addressing the challenges caused by limited network resources and discrepancies between the data shared by different sources. In this paper, we examine the requirements, limitations, and performance of different cooperative perception techniques, and present an in-depth analysis of the notion of Deep Feature Sharing (DFS). We explore different cooperative object detection designs and evaluate their performance in terms of average precision. We use the Volony dataset for our experimental study. The results confirm that the DFS methods are significantly less sensitive to the localization error caused by GPS noise. Furthermore, the results attest that detection gain of DFS methods caused by adding more cooperative participants in the scenes is comparable to raw information sharing technique while DFS enables flexibility in design toward satisfying communication requirements.\n",
      "Recently, many researchers have attempted to improve deep learning-based object detection models, both in terms of accuracy and operational speeds. However, frequently, there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy of such models, which encumbers their use in practical applications such as autonomous navigation. In this paper, we explore a meta-cognitive learning strategy for object detection to improve generalization ability while at the same time maintaining detection speed. The meta-cognitive method selectively samples the object instances in the training dataset to reduce overfitting. We use YOLO v3 Tiny as a base model for the work and evaluate the performance using the MS COCO dataset. The experimental results indicate an improvement in absolute precision of 2.6% (minimum), and 4.4% (maximum), with no overhead to inference time.\n",
      "The \"You only look once v4\"(YOLOv4) is one type of object detection methods in deep learning. YOLOv4-tiny is proposed based on YOLOv4 to simple the network structure and reduce parameters, which makes it be suitable for developing on the mobile and embedded devices. To improve the real-time of object detection, a fast object detection method is proposed based on YOLOv4-tiny. It firstly uses two ResBlock-D modules in ResNet-D network instead of two CSPBlock modules in Yolov4-tiny, which reduces the computation complexity. Secondly, it designs an auxiliary residual network block to extract more feature information of object to reduce detection error. In the design of auxiliary network, two consecutive 3x3 convolutions are used to obtain 5x5 receptive fields to extract global features, and channel attention and spatial attention are also used to extract more effective information. In the end, it merges the auxiliary network and backbone network to construct the whole network structure of improved YOLOv4-tiny. Simulation results show that the proposed method has faster object detection than YOLOv4-tiny and YOLOv3-tiny, and almost the same mean value of average precision as the YOLOv4-tiny. It is more suitable for real-time object detection.\n",
      "In the traditional deep compression framework, iteratively performing network pruning and quantization can reduce the model size and computation cost to meet the deployment requirements. However, such a step-wise application of pruning and quantization may lead to suboptimal solutions and unnecessary time consumption. In this paper, we tackle this issue by integrating network pruning and quantization as a unified joint compression problem and then use AutoML to automatically solve it. We find the pruning process can be regarded as the channel-wise quantization with 0 bit. Thus, the separate two-step pruning and quantization can be simplified as the one-step quantization with mixed precision. This unification not only simplifies the compression pipeline but also avoids the compression divergence. To implement this idea, we propose the automated model compression by jointly applied pruning and quantization (AJPQ). AJPQ is designed with a hierarchical architecture: the layer controller controls the layer sparsity, and the channel controller decides the bit-width for each kernel. Following the same importance criterion, the layer controller and the channel controller collaboratively decide the compression strategy. With the help of reinforcement learning, our one-step compression is automatically achieved. Compared with the state-of-the-art automated compression methods, our method obtains a better accuracy while reducing the storage considerably. For fixed precision quantization, AJPQ can reduce more than five times model size and two times computation with a slight performance increase for Skynet in remote sensing object detection. When mixed-precision is allowed, AJPQ can reduce five times model size with only 1.06% top-5 accuracy decline for MobileNet in the classification task.\n",
      "Existing methods for object detection in UAV images ignored an important challenge - imbalanced class distribution in UAV images - which leads to poor performance on tail classes. We systematically investigate existing solutions to long-tail problems and unveil that re-balancing methods that are effective on natural image datasets cannot be trivially applied to UAV datasets. To this end, we rethink long-tailed object detection in UAV images and propose the Dual Sampler and Head detection Network (DSHNet), which is the first work that aims to resolve long-tail distribution in UAV images. The key components in DSHNet include Class-Biased Samplers (CBS) and Bilateral Box Heads (BBH), which are developed to cope with tail classes and head classes in a dual-path manner. Without bells and whistles, DSHNet significantly boosts the performance of tail classes on different detection frameworks. Moreover, DSHNet significantly outperforms base detectors and generic approaches for long-tail problems on VisDrone and UAVDT datasets. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance when combining with image cropping methods. Code is available at https://github.com/we1pingyu/DSHNet\n",
      "Scale variance is one of the crucial challenges in multi-scale object detection. Early approaches address this problem by exploiting the image and feature pyramid, which raises suboptimal results with computation burden and constrains from inherent network structures. Pioneering works also propose multi-scale (i.e., multi-level and multi-branch) feature fusions to remedy the issue and have achieved encouraging progress. However, existing fusions still have certain limitations such as feature scale inconsistency, ignorance of level-wise semantic transformation, and coarse granularity. In this work, we present a novel module, the Fluff block, to alleviate drawbacks of current multi-scale fusion methods and facilitate multi-scale object detection. Specifically, Fluff leverages both multi-level and multi-branch schemes with dilated convolutions to have rapid, effective and finer-grained feature fusions. Furthermore, we integrate Fluff to SSD as FluffNet, a powerful real-time single-stage detector for multi-scale object detection. Empirical results on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC have demonstrated that FluffNet obtains remarkable efficiency with state-of-the-art accuracy. Additionally, we indicate the great generality of the Fluff block by showing how to embed it to other widely-used detectors as well.\n",
      "Few-shot learning has recently emerged as a new challenge in the deep learning field: unlike conventional methods that train the deep neural networks (DNNs) with a large number of labeled data, it asks for the generalization of DNNs on new classes with few annotated samples. Recent advances in few-shot learning mainly focus on image classification while in this paper we focus on object detection. The initial explorations in few-shot object detection tend to simulate a classification scenario by using the positive proposals in images with respect to certain object class while discarding the negative proposals of that class. Negatives, especially hard negatives, however, are essential to the embedding space learning in few-shot object detection. In this paper, we restore the negative information in few-shot object detection by introducing a new negative- and positive-representative based metric learning framework and a new inference scheme with negative and positive representatives. We build our work on a recent few-shot pipeline RepMet with several new modules to encode negative information for both training and testing. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-LOC and PASCAL VOC show our method substantially improves the state-of-the-art few-shot object detection solutions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yang-yk/NP-RepMet.\n",
      "Recently, SpineNet has demonstrated promising results on object detection and image classification over ResNet model. However, it is unclear if the improvement adds up when combining scale-permuted backbone with advanced efficient operations and compound scaling. Furthermore, SpineNet is built with a uniform resource distribution over operations. While this strategy seems to be prevalent for scale-decreased models, it may not be an optimal design for scale-permuted models. In this work, we propose a simple technique to combine efficient operations and compound scaling with a previously learned scale-permuted architecture. We demonstrate the efficiency of scale-permuted model can be further improved by learning a resource distribution over the entire network. The resulting efficient scale-permuted models outperform state-of-the-art EfficientNet-based models on object detection and achieve competitive performance on image classification and semantic segmentation. Code and models will be open-sourced soon.\n",
      "Existing work on object detection often relies on a single form of annotation: the model is trained using either accurate yet costly bounding boxes or cheaper but less expressive image-level tags. However, real-world annotations are often diverse in form, which challenges these existing works. In this paper, we present UFO$^2$, a unified object detection framework that can handle different forms of supervision simultaneously. Specifically, UFO$^2$ incorporates strong supervision (e.g., boxes), various forms of partial supervision (e.g., class tags, points, and scribbles), and unlabeled data. Through rigorous evaluations, we demonstrate that each form of label can be utilized to either train a model from scratch or to further improve a pre-trained model. We also use UFO$^2$ to investigate budget-aware omni-supervised learning, i.e., various annotation policies are studied under a fixed annotation budget: we show that competitive performance needs no strong labels for all data. Finally, we demonstrate the generalization of UFO$^2$, detecting more than 1,000 different objects without bounding box annotations.\n",
      "Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely and successfully used in Object Detection, e.g. Faster RCNN, YOLO, CenterNet. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks against object detection can be divided into two categories, whole-pixel attacks and patch attacks. While these attacks add perturbations to a large number of pixels in images, we proposed a diffused patch attack (\\textbf{DPAttack}) to successfully fool object detectors by diffused patches of asteroid-shaped or grid-shape, which only change a small number of pixels. Experiments show that our DPAttack can successfully fool most object detectors with diffused patches and we get the second place in the Alibaba Tianchi competition: Alibaba-Tsinghua Adversarial Challenge on Object Detection. Our code can be obtained from https://github.com/Wu-Shudeng/DPAttack.\n",

      "Salient object detection plays an important part in a vision system to detect important regions. Convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods directly train their models with large-scale datasets, but what is the crucial feature for saliency is still a problem. In this paper, we establish a novel bottom-up feature named convex hull overlap (CHO), combining with appearance contrast features, to detect salient objects. CHO feature is a kind of enhanced Gestalt cue. Psychologists believe that surroundedness reflects objects overlap relationship. An object which is on the top of the others is attractive. Our method significantly differs from other earlier works in (1) We set up a hand-crafted feature to detect salient object that our model does not need to be trained by large-scale datasets; (2) Previous works only focus on appearance features, while our CHO feature makes up the gap between the spatial object covering and the object's saliency. Our experiments on a large number of public datasets have obtained very positive results.\n",
      "While training on samples drawn from independent and identical distribution has been a de facto paradigm for optimizing image classification networks, humans learn new concepts in an easy-to-hard manner and on the selected examples progressively. Driven by this fact, we investigate the training paradigms where the samples are not drawn from independent and identical distribution. We propose a data sampling strategy, named Drop-and-Refresh (DaR), motivated by the learning behaviors of humans that selectively drop easy samples and refresh them only periodically. We show in our experiments that the proposed DaR strategy can maintain (and in many cases improve) the predictive accuracy even when the training cost is reduced by 15% on various datasets (CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100 and ImageNet) and with different backbone architectures (ResNets, DenseNets and MobileNets). Furthermore and perhaps more importantly, we find the ImageNet pre-trained models using our DaR sampling strategy achieves better transferability for the downstream tasks including object detection (+0.3 AP), instance segmentation (+0.3 AP), scene parsing (+0.5 mIoU) and human pose estimation (+0.6 AP). Our investigation encourages people to rethink the connections between the sampling strategy for training and the transferability of its learned features for pre-training ImageNet models.\n",
      "Biometric-based personal authentication systems have seen a strong demand mainly due to the increasing concern in various privacy and security applications. Although the use of each biometric trait is problem dependent, the human ear has been found to have enough discriminating characteristics to allow its use as a strong biometric measure. To locate an ear in a 2D side face image is a challenging task, numerous existing approaches have achieved significant performance, but the majority of studies are based on the constrained environment. However, ear biometrics possess a great level of difficulties in the unconstrained environment, where pose, scale, occlusion, illuminations, background clutter etc. varies to a great extent. To address the problem of ear localization in the wild, we have proposed two high-performance region of interest (ROI) segmentation models UESegNet-1 and UESegNet-2, which are fundamentally based on deep convolutional neural networks and primarily uses contextual information to localize ear in the unconstrained environment. Additionally, we have applied state-of-the-art deep learning models viz; FRCNN (Faster Region Proposal Network) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detecor) for ear localization task. To test the model's generalization, they are evaluated on six different benchmark datasets viz; IITD, IITK, USTB-DB3, UND-E, UND-J2 and UBEAR, all of which contain challenging images. The performance of the models is compared on the basis of object detection performance measure parameters such as IOU (Intersection Over Union), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It has been observed that the proposed models UESegNet-1 and UESegNet-2 outperformed the FRCNN and SSD at higher values of IOUs i.e. an accuracy of 100\\% is achieved at IOU 0.5 on majority of the databases.\n",
      "We show how feature maps in convolutional networks are susceptible to spatial bias. Due to a combination of architectural choices, the activation at certain locations is systematically elevated or weakened. The major source of this bias is the padding mechanism. Depending on several aspects of convolution arithmetic, this mechanism can apply the padding unevenly, leading to asymmetries in the learned weights. We demonstrate how such bias can be detrimental to certain tasks such as small object detection: the activation is suppressed if the stimulus lies in the impacted area, leading to blind spots and misdetection. We propose solutions to mitigate spatial bias and demonstrate how they can improve model accuracy.\n",
      "Curriculum learning techniques are a viable solution for improving the accuracy of automatic models, by replacing the traditional random training with an easy-to-hard strategy. However, the standard curriculum methodology does not automatically provide improved results, but it is constrained by multiple elements like the data distribution or the proposed model. In this paper, we introduce a novel curriculum sampling strategy which takes into consideration the diversity of the training data together with the difficulty of the inputs. We determine the difficulty using a state-of-the-art estimator based on the human time required for solving a visual search task. We consider this kind of difficulty metric to be better suited for solving general problems, as it is not based on certain task-dependent elements, but more on the context of each image. We ensure the diversity during training, giving higher priority to elements from less visited classes. We conduct object detection and instance segmentation experiments on Pascal VOC 2007 and Cityscapes data sets, surpassing both the randomly-trained baseline and the standard curriculum approach. We prove that our strategy is very efficient for unbalanced data sets, leading to faster convergence and more accurate results, when other curriculum-based strategies fail.\n",
      "Advances in deep learning have enabled the development of models that have exhibited a remarkable tendency to recognize and even localize actions in videos. However, they tend to experience errors when faced with scenes or examples beyond their initial training environment. Hence, they fail to adapt to new domains without significant retraining with large amounts of annotated data. Current algorithms are trained in an inductive learning environment where they use data-driven models to learn associations between input observations with a fixed set of known classes. In this paper, we propose to overcome these limitations by moving to an open world setting by decoupling the ideas of recognition and reasoning. Building upon the compositional representation offered by Grenander's Pattern Theory formalism, we show that attention and commonsense knowledge can be used to enable the self-supervised discovery of novel actions in egocentric videos in an open-world setting, a considerably more difficult task than zero-shot learning and (un)supervised domain adaptation tasks where target domain data (both labeled and unlabeled) are available during training. We show that our approach can be used to infer and learn novel classes for open vocabulary classification in egocentric videos and novel object detection with zero supervision. Extensive experiments show that it performs competitively with fully supervised baselines on publicly available datasets under open-world conditions. This is one of the first works to address the problem of open-world action recognition in egocentric videos with zero human supervision to the best of our knowledge.\n",
      "Haze can degrade the visibility and the image quality drastically, thus degrading the performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection. Single image dehazing is a challenging and ill-posed problem, despite being widely studied. Most existing methods assume that haze has a uniform/homogeneous distribution and haze can have a single color, i.e. grayish white color similar to smoke, while in reality haze can be distributed non-uniformly with different patterns and colors. In this paper, we focus on haze created by sunlight as it is one of the most prevalent type of haze in the wild. Sunlight can generate non-uniformly distributed haze with drastic density changes due to sun rays and also a spectrum of haze color due to sunlight color changes during the day. This presents a new challenge to image dehazing methods. For these methods to be practical, this problem needs to be addressed. To quantify the challenges and assess the performance of these methods, we present a sunlight haze benchmark dataset, Sun-Haze, containing 107 hazy images with different types of haze created by sunlight having a variety of intensity and color. We evaluate a representative set of state-of-the-art image dehazing methods on this benchmark dataset in terms of standard metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, CIEDE2000, PI and NIQE. This uncovers the limitation of the current methods, and questions their underlying assumptions as well as their practicality.\n",
      "A split-transform-merge strategy has been broadly used as an architectural constraint in convolutional neural networks for visual recognition tasks. It approximates sparsely connected networks by explicitly defining multiple branches to simultaneously learn representations with different visual concepts or properties. Dependencies or interactions between these representations are typically defined by dense and local operations, however, without any adaptiveness or high-level reasoning. In this work, we propose to exploit this strategy and combine it with our Visual Concept Reasoning Networks (VCRNet) to enable reasoning between high-level visual concepts. We associate each branch with a visual concept and derive a compact concept state by selecting a few local descriptors through an attention module. These concept states are then updated by graph-based interaction and used to adaptively modulate the local descriptors. We describe our proposed model by split-transform-attend-interact-modulate-merge stages, which are implemented by opting for a highly modularized architecture. Extensive experiments on visual recognition tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, scene recognition, and action recognition show that our proposed model, VCRNet, consistently improves the performance by increasing the number of parameters by less than 1%.\n",
      "3D object detection is a core perceptual challenge for robotics and autonomous driving. However, the class-taxonomies in modern autonomous driving datasets are significantly smaller than many influential 2D detection datasets. In this work, we address the long-tail problem by leveraging both the large class-taxonomies of modern 2D datasets and the robustness of state-of-the-art 2D detection methods. We proceed to mine a large, unlabeled dataset of images and LiDAR, and estimate 3D object bounding cuboids, seeded from an off-the-shelf 2D instance segmentation model. Critically, we constrain this ill-posed 2D-to-3D mapping by using high-definition maps and object size priors. The result of the mining process is 3D cuboids with varying confidence. This mining process is itself a 3D object detector, although not especially accurate when evaluated as such. However, we then train a 3D object detection model on these cuboids, consistent with other recent observations in the deep learning literature, we find that the resulting model is fairly robust to the noisy supervision that our mining process provides. We mine a collection of 1151 unlabeled, multimodal driving logs from an autonomous vehicle and use the discovered objects to train a LiDAR-based object detector. We show that detector performance increases as we mine more unlabeled data. With our full, unlabeled dataset, our method performs competitively with fully supervised methods, even exceeding the performance for certain object categories, without any human 3D annotations.\n",
      "Displaying near-real-time traffic information is a useful feature of digital navigation maps. However, most commercial providers rely on privacy-compromising measures such as deriving location information from cellphones to estimate traffic. The lack of an open-source traffic estimation method using open data platforms is a bottleneck for building sophisticated navigation services on top of OpenStreetMap (OSM). We propose a deep learning-based Complex Event Processing (CEP) method that relies on publicly available video camera streams for traffic estimation. The proposed framework performs near-real-time object detection and objects property extraction across camera clusters in parallel to derive multiple measures related to traffic with the results visualized on OpenStreetMap. The estimation of object properties (e.g. vehicle speed, count, direction) provides multidimensional data that can be leveraged to create metrics and visualization for congestion beyond commonly used density-based measures. Our approach couples both flow and count measures during interpolation by considering each vehicle as a sample point and their speed as weight. We demonstrate multidimensional traffic metrics (e.g. flow rate, congestion estimation) over OSM by processing 22 traffic cameras from London streets. The system achieves a near-real-time performance of 1.42 seconds median latency and an average F-score of 0.80.\n",
      "In this paper, we study the task of embodied interactive learning for object detection. Given a set of environments (and some labeling budget), our goal is to learn an object detector by having an agent select what data to obtain labels for. How should an exploration policy decide which trajectory should be labeled? One possibility is to use a trained object detector's failure cases as an external reward. However, this will require labeling millions of frames required for training RL policies, which is infeasible. Instead, we explore a self-supervised approach for training our exploration policy by introducing a notion of semantic curiosity. Our semantic curiosity policy is based on a simple observation -- the detection outputs should be consistent. Therefore, our semantic curiosity rewards trajectories with inconsistent labeling behavior and encourages the exploration policy to explore such areas. The exploration policy trained via semantic curiosity generalizes to novel scenes and helps train an object detector that outperforms baselines trained with other possible alternatives such as random exploration, prediction-error curiosity, and coverage-maximizing exploration.\n",
      "Systems based on artificial intelligence and machine learning models should be transparent, in the sense of being capable of explaining their decisions to gain humans' approval and trust. While there are a number of explainability techniques that can be used to this end, many of them are only capable of outputting a single one-size-fits-all explanation that simply cannot address all of the explainees' diverse needs. In this work we introduce a model-agnostic and post-hoc local explainability technique for black-box predictions called LIMEtree, which employs surrogate multi-output regression trees. We validate our algorithm on a deep neural network trained for object detection in images and compare it against Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). Our method comes with local fidelity guarantees and can produce a range of diverse explanation types, including contrastive and counterfactual explanations praised in the literature. Some of these explanations can be interactively personalised to create bespoke, meaningful and actionable insights into the model's behaviour. While other methods may give an illusion of customisability by wrapping, otherwise static, explanations in an interactive interface, our explanations are truly interactive, in the sense of allowing the user to \"interrogate\" a black-box model. LIMEtree can therefore produce consistent explanations on which an interactive exploratory process can be built.\n",
      "We present a novel method of compression of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by weight sharing through a new representation of convolutional filters. The proposed method reduces the number of parameters of each convolutional layer by learning a 1D vector termed Filter Summary (FS). The convolutional filters are located in FS as overlapping 1D segments, and nearby filters in FS share weights in their overlapping regions in a natural way. The resultant neural network based on such weight sharing scheme, termed Filter Summary CNNs or FSNet, has a FS in each convolution layer instead of a set of independent filters in the conventional convolution layer. FSNet has the same architecture as that of the baseline CNN to be compressed, and each convolution layer of FSNet has the same number of filters from FS as that of the basline CNN in the forward process. With compelling computational acceleration ratio, the parameter space of FSNet is much smaller than that of the baseline CNN. In addition, FSNet is quantization friendly. FSNet with weight quantization leads to even higher compression ratio without noticeable performance loss. We further propose Differentiable FSNet where the way filters share weights is learned in a differentiable and end-to-end manner. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FSNet in compression of CNNs for computer vision tasks including image classification and object detection, and the effectiveness of DFSNet is evidenced by the task of Neural Architecture Search.\n",
      "We present Hybrid Voxel Network (HVNet), a novel one-stage unified network for point cloud based 3D object detection for autonomous driving. Recent studies show that 2D voxelization with per voxel PointNet style feature extractor leads to accurate and efficient detector for large 3D scenes. Since the size of the feature map determines the computation and memory cost, the size of the voxel becomes a parameter that is hard to balance. A smaller voxel size gives a better performance, especially for small objects, but a longer inference time. A larger voxel can cover the same area with a smaller feature map, but fails to capture intricate features and accurate location for smaller objects. We present a Hybrid Voxel network that solves this problem by fusing voxel feature encoder (VFE) of different scales at point-wise level and project into multiple pseudo-image feature maps. We further propose an attentive voxel feature encoding that outperforms plain VFE and a feature fusion pyramid network to aggregate multi-scale information at feature map level. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that a single HVNet achieves the best mAP among all existing methods with a real time inference speed of 31Hz.\n",
      "Monocular 3D object detection is an essential component in autonomous driving while challenging to solve, especially for those occluded samples which are only partially visible. Most detectors consider each 3D object as an independent training target, inevitably resulting in a lack of useful information for occluded samples. To this end, we propose a novel method to improve the monocular 3D object detection by considering the relationship of paired samples. This allows us to encode spatial constraints for partially-occluded objects from their adjacent neighbors. Specifically, the proposed detector computes uncertainty-aware predictions for object locations and 3D distances for the adjacent object pairs, which are subsequently jointly optimized by nonlinear least squares. Finally, the one-stage uncertainty-aware prediction structure and the post-optimization module are dedicatedly integrated for ensuring the run-time efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields the best performance on KITTI 3D detection benchmark, by outperforming state-of-the-art competitors by wide margins, especially for the hard samples.\n",
      "Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) have been extremely successful in solving intensive computer vision tasks. The convolutional filters used in CNNs have played a major role in this success, by extracting useful features from the inputs. Recently researchers have tried to boost the performance of CNNs by re-calibrating the feature maps produced by these filters, e.g., Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENets). These approaches have achieved better performance by Exciting up the important channels or feature maps while diminishing the rest. However, in the process, architectural complexity has increased. We propose an architectural block that introduces much lower complexity than the existing methods of CNN performance boosting while performing significantly better than them. We carry out experiments on the CIFAR, ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets, and show that the proposed block can challenge the state-of-the-art results. Our method boosts the ResNet-50 architecture to perform comparably to the ResNet-152 architecture, which is a three times deeper network, on classification. We also show experimentally that our method is not limited to classification but also generalizes well to other tasks such as object detection.\n",
      "Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block presents a channel attention mechanism for modeling global context via explicitly capturing dependencies across channels. However, we are still far from understanding how the SE block works. In this work, we first revisit the SE block, and then present a detailed empirical study of the relationship between global context and attention distribution, based on which we propose a simple yet effective module, called Linear Context Transform (LCT) block. We divide all channels into different groups and normalize the globally aggregated context features within each channel group, reducing the disturbance from irrelevant channels. Through linear transform of the normalized context features, we model global context for each channel independently. The LCT block is extremely lightweight and easy to be plugged into different backbone models while with negligible parameters and computational burden increase. Extensive experiments show that the LCT block outperforms the SE block in image classification task on the ImageNet and object detection/segmentation on the COCO dataset with different backbone models. Moreover, LCT yields consistent performance gains over existing state-of-the-art detection architectures, e.g., 1.5$\\sim$1.7% AP$^{bbox}$ and 1.0$\\sim$1.2% AP$^{mask}$ improvements on the COCO benchmark, irrespective of different baseline models of varied capacities. We hope our simple yet effective approach will shed some light on future research of attention-based models.\n",
      "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great success in automating the design of neural networks, but the prohibitive amount of computations behind current NAS methods requires further investigations in improving the sample efficiency and the network evaluation cost to get better results in a shorter time. In this paper, we present a novel scalable Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based NAS agent, named AlphaX, to tackle these two aspects. AlphaX improves the search efficiency by adaptively balancing the exploration and exploitation at the state level, and by a Meta-Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict network accuracies for biasing the search toward a promising region. To amortize the network evaluation cost, AlphaX accelerates MCTS rollouts with a distributed design and reduces the number of epochs in evaluating a network by transfer learning, which is guided with the tree structure in MCTS. In 12 GPU days and 1000 samples, AlphaX found an architecture that reaches 97.84\\% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10, and 75.5\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, exceeding SOTA NAS methods in both the accuracy and sampling efficiency. Particularly, we also evaluate AlphaX on NASBench-101, a large scale NAS dataset; AlphaX is 3x and 2.8x more sample efficient than Random Search and Regularized Evolution in finding the global optimum. Finally, we show the searched architecture improves a variety of vision applications from Neural Style Transfer, to Image Captioning and Object Detection.\n",
      "Classical CNN based object detection methods only extract the objects' image features, but do not consider the high-level relationship among objects in context. In this article, the graph convolutional networks (GCN) is integrated into the object detection framework to exploit the benefit of category relationship among objects, which is able to provide extra confidence for any pre-trained object detection model in our framework. In experiments, we test several popular base detection models on COCO dataset. The results show promising improvement on mAP by 1-5pp. In addition, visualized analysis reveals the benchmark improvement is quite reasonable in human's opinion.\n",
      "Image captioning models have achieved impressive results on datasets containing limited visual concepts and large amounts of paired image-caption training data. However, if these models are to ever function in the wild, a much larger variety of visual concepts must be learned, ideally from less supervision. To encourage the development of image captioning models that can learn visual concepts from alternative data sources, such as object detection datasets, we present the first large-scale benchmark for this task. Dubbed 'nocaps', for novel object captioning at scale, our benchmark consists of 166,100 human-generated captions describing 15,100 images from the OpenImages validation and test sets. The associated training data consists of COCO image-caption pairs, plus OpenImages image-level labels and object bounding boxes. Since OpenImages contains many more classes than COCO, nearly 400 object classes seen in test images have no or very few associated training captions (hence, nocaps). We extend existing novel object captioning models to establish strong baselines for this benchmark and provide analysis to guide future work on this task.\n",
      "Object detection models shipped with camera-equipped edge devices cannot cover the objects of interest for every user. Therefore, the incremental learning capability is a critical feature for a robust and personalized object detection system that many applications would rely on. In this paper, we present an efficient yet practical system, RILOD, to incrementally train an existing object detection model such that it can detect new object classes without losing its capability to detect old classes. The key component of RILOD is a novel incremental learning algorithm that trains end-to-end for one-stage deep object detection models only using training data of new object classes. Specifically to avoid catastrophic forgetting, the algorithm distills three types of knowledge from the old model to mimic the old model's behavior on object classification, bounding box regression and feature extraction. In addition, since the training data for the new classes may not be available, a real-time dataset construction pipeline is designed to collect training images on-the-fly and automatically label the images with both category and bounding box annotations. We have implemented RILOD under both edge-cloud and edge-only setups. Experiment results show that the proposed system can learn to detect a new object class in just a few minutes, including both dataset construction and model training. In comparison, traditional fine-tuning based method may take a few hours for training, and in most cases would also need a tedious and costly manual dataset labeling step.\n",
      "Classification and differentiation of small pathological objects may greatly vary among human raters due to differences in training, expertise and their consistency over time. In a radiological setting, objects commonly have high within-class appearance variability whilst sharing certain characteristics across different classes, making their distinction even more difficult. As an example, markers of cerebral small vessel disease, such as enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) and lacunes, can be very varied in their appearance while exhibiting high inter-class similarity, making this task highly challenging for human raters. In this work, we investigate joint models of individual rater behaviour and multirater consensus in a deep learning setting, and apply it to a brain lesion object-detection task. Results show that jointly modelling both individual and consensus estimates leads to significant improvements in performance when compared to directly predicting consensus labels, while also allowing the characterization of human-rater consistency.\n",
      "Autonomous driving requires various computer vision algorithms, such as object detection and tracking.Precisely-labeled datasets (i.e., objects are fully contained in bounding boxes with only a few extra pixels) are preferred for training such algorithms, so that the algorithms can detect exact locations of the objects. However, it is very time-consuming and hence expensive to generate precise labels for image sequences at scale. In this paper, we propose DeepBbox, an algorithm that corrects loose object labels into right bounding boxes to reduce human annotation efforts. We use Cityscapes dataset to show annotation efficiency and accuracy improvement using DeepBbox. Experimental results show that, with DeepBbox,we can increase the number of object edges that are labeled automatically (within 1\\% error) by 50% to reduce manual annotation time.\n",
      "In e-commerce, product content, especially product images have a significant influence on a customer's journey from product discovery to evaluation and finally, purchase decision. Since many e-commerce retailers sell items from other third-party marketplace sellers besides their own, the content published by both internal and external content creators needs to be monitored and enriched, wherever possible. Despite guidelines and warnings, product listings that contain offensive and non-compliant images continue to enter catalogs. Offensive and non-compliant content can include a wide range of objects, logos, and banners conveying violent, sexually explicit, racist, or promotional messages. Such images can severely damage the customer experience, lead to legal issues, and erode the company brand. In this paper, we present a computer vision driven offensive and non-compliant image detection system for extremely large image datasets. This paper delves into the unique challenges of applying deep learning to real-world product image data from retail world. We demonstrate how we resolve a number of technical challenges such as lack of training data, severe class imbalance, fine-grained class definitions etc. using a number of practical yet unique technical strategies. Our system combines state-of-the-art image classification and object detection techniques with budgeted crowdsourcing to develop a solution customized for a massive, diverse, and constantly evolving product catalog.\n",
      "Cameras are an essential part of sensor suite in autonomous driving. Surround-view cameras are directly exposed to external environment and are vulnerable to get soiled. Cameras have a much higher degradation in performance due to soiling compared to other sensors. Thus it is critical to accurately detect soiling on the cameras, particularly for higher levels of autonomous driving. We created a new dataset having multiple types of soiling namely opaque and transparent. It will be released publicly as part of our WoodScape dataset \\cite{yogamani2019woodscape} to encourage further research. We demonstrate high accuracy using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture. We also show that it can be combined with the existing object detection task in a multi-task learning framework. Finally, we make use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate more images for data augmentation and show that it works successfully similar to the style transfer.\n",
      "LiDAR has become a standard sensor for autonomous driving applications as they provide highly precise 3D point clouds. LiDAR is also robust for low-light scenarios at night-time or due to shadows where the performance of cameras is degraded. LiDAR perception is gradually becoming mature for algorithms including object detection and SLAM. However, semantic segmentation algorithm remains to be relatively less explored. Motivated by the fact that semantic segmentation is a mature algorithm on image data, we explore sensor fusion based 3D segmentation. Our main contribution is to convert the RGB image to a polar-grid mapping representation used for LiDAR and design early and mid-level fusion architectures. Additionally, we design a hybrid fusion architecture that combines both fusion algorithms. We evaluate our algorithm on KITTI dataset which provides segmentation annotation for cars, pedestrians and cyclists. We evaluate two state-of-the-art architectures namely SqueezeSeg and PointSeg and improve the mIoU score by 10 % in both cases relative to the LiDAR only baseline.\n",

Covering 228 publications, we survey i) roots, key concepts, and tasks, ii) core techniques and main modeling trends, and iii) datasets and evaluation metrics for salient object detection. We also discuss open problems such as evaluation metrics and dataset bias in model performance, and suggest future research directions.\n",

      "State-of-the-art CNN based recognition models are often computationally prohibitive to deploy on low-end devices. A promising high level approach tackling this limitation is knowledge distillation, which let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher model's output to get improved generalization. However, related methods mainly focus on simple task of classification while do not consider complex tasks like object detection. We show applying the vanilla knowledge distillation to detection model gets minor gain. To address the challenge of distilling knowledge in detection model, we propose a fine-grained feature imitation method exploiting the cross-location discrepancy of feature response. Our intuition is that detectors care more about local near object regions. Thus the discrepancy of feature response on the near object anchor locations reveals important information of how teacher model tends to generalize. We design a novel mechanism to estimate those locations and let student model imitate the teacher on them to get enhanced performance. We first validate the idea on a developed lightweight toy detector which carries simplest notion of current state-of-the-art anchor based detection models on challenging KITTI dataset, our method generates up to 15% boost of mAP for the student model compared to the non-imitated counterpart. We then extensively evaluate the method with Faster R-CNN model under various scenarios with common object detection benchmark of Pascal VOC and COCO, imitation alleviates up to 74% performance drop of student model compared to teacher.

      "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based accurate prediction typically requires large-scale annotated training data. In Medical Imaging, however, both obtaining medical data and annotating them by expert physicians are challenging; to overcome this lack of data, Data Augmentation (DA) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is essential, since they can synthesize additional annotated training data to handle small and fragmented medical images from various scanners--those generated images, realistic but completely novel, can further fill the real image distribution uncovered by the original dataset. As a tutorial, this paper introduces GAN-based Medical Image Augmentation, along with tricks to boost classification/object detection/segmentation performance using them, based on our experience and related work. Moreover, we show our first GAN-based DA work using automatic bounding box annotation, for robust CNN-based brain metastases detection on 256 x 256 MR images; GAN-based DA can boost 10% sensitivity in diagnosis with a clinically acceptable number of additional False Positives, even with highly-rough and inconsistent bounding boxes.\n",
      "In this study, we present an analysis of model-based ensemble learning for 3D point-cloud object classification and detection. An ensemble of multiple model instances is known to outperform a single model instance, but there is little study of the topic of ensemble learning for 3D point clouds. First, an ensemble of multiple model instances trained on the same part of the $\\textit{ModelNet40}$ dataset was tested for seven deep learning, point cloud-based classification algorithms: $\\textit{PointNet}$, $\\textit{PointNet++}$, $\\textit{SO-Net}$, $\\textit{KCNet}$, $\\textit{DeepSets}$, $\\textit{DGCNN}$, and $\\textit{PointCNN}$. Second, the ensemble of different architectures was tested. Results of our experiments show that the tested ensemble learning methods improve over state-of-the-art on the $\\textit{ModelNet40}$ dataset, from $92.65\\%$ to $93.64\\%$ for the ensemble of single architecture instances, $94.03\\%$ for two different architectures, and $94.15\\%$ for five different architectures. We show that the ensemble of two models with different architectures can be as effective as the ensemble of 10 models with the same architecture. Third, a study on classic bagging i.e. with different subsets used for training multiple model instances) was tested and sources of ensemble accuracy growth were investigated for best-performing architecture, i.e. $\\textit{SO-Net}$. We also investigate the ensemble learning of $\\textit{Frustum PointNet}$ approach in the task of 3D object detection, increasing the average precision of 3D box detection on the $\\textit{KITTI}$ dataset from $63.1\\%$ to $66.5\\%$ using only three model instances.

      "Vision-based navigation of autonomous vehicles primarily depends on the Deep Neural Network (DNN) based systems in which the controller obtains input from sensors/detectors, such as cameras and produces a vehicle control output, such as a steering wheel angle to navigate the vehicle safely in a roadway traffic environment. Typically, these DNN-based systems of the autonomous vehicle are trained through supervised learning; however, recent studies show that a trained DNN-based system can be compromised by perturbation or adversarial inputs. Similarly, this perturbation can be introduced into the DNN-based systems of autonomous vehicle by unexpected roadway hazards, such as debris and roadblocks. In this study, we first introduce a roadway hazardous environment (both intentional and unintentional roadway hazards) that can compromise the DNN-based navigational system of an autonomous vehicle, and produces an incorrect steering wheel angle, which can cause crashes resulting in fatality and injury. Then, we develop a DNN-based autonomous vehicle driving system using object detection and semantic segmentation to mitigate the adverse effect of this type of hazardous environment, which helps the autonomous vehicle to navigate safely around such hazards. We find that our developed DNN-based autonomous vehicle driving system including hazardous object detection and semantic segmentation improves the navigational ability of an autonomous vehicle to avoid a potential hazard by 21% compared to the traditional DNN-based autonomous vehicle driving system.\n",
      "Unpaired Image-to-image Translation is a new rising and challenging vision problem that aims to learn a mapping between unaligned image pairs in diverse domains. Recent advances in this field like MUNIT and DRIT mainly focus on disentangling content and style/attribute from a given image first, then directly adopting the global style to guide the model to synthesize new domain images. However, this kind of approaches severely incurs contradiction if the target domain images are content-rich with multiple discrepant objects. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective instance-aware image-to-image translation approach (INIT), which employs the fine-grained local (instance) and global styles to the target image spatially. The proposed INIT exhibits three import advantages: (1) the instance-level objective loss can help learn a more accurate reconstruction and incorporate diverse attributes of objects; (2) the styles used for target domain of local/global areas are from corresponding spatial regions in source domain, which intuitively is a more reasonable mapping; (3) the joint training process can benefit both fine and coarse granularity and incorporates instance information to improve the quality of global translation. We also collect a large-scale benchmark for the new instance-level translation task. We observe that our synthetic images can even benefit real-world vision tasks like generic object detection.\n",
      "At present, the performance of deep neural network in general object detection is comparable to or even surpasses that of human beings. However, due to the limitations of deep learning itself, the small proportion of feature pixels, and the occurence of blur and occlusion, the detection of small objects in complex scenes is still an open question. But we can not deny that real-time and accurate object detection is fundamental to automatic perception and subsequent perception-based decision-making and planning tasks of autonomous driving.   Considering the characteristics of small objects in autonomous driving scene, we proposed a novel method named KB-RANN, which based on domain knowledge, intuitive experience and feature attentive selection. It can focus on particular parts of image features, and then it tries to stress the importance of these features and strengthenes the learning parameters of them. Our comparative experiments on KITTI and COCO datasets show that our proposed method can achieve considerable results both in speed and accuracy, and can improve the effect of small object detection through self-selection of important features and continuous enhancement of proposed method, and deployed it in our self-developed autonomous driving car.\n",
      "Intersection over Union (IoU) is the most popular evaluation metric used in the object detection benchmarks. However, there is a gap between optimizing the commonly used distance losses for regressing the parameters of a bounding box and maximizing this metric value. The optimal objective for a metric is the metric itself. In the case of axis-aligned 2D bounding boxes, it can be shown that $IoU$ can be directly used as a regression loss. However, $IoU$ has a plateau making it infeasible to optimize in the case of non-overlapping bounding boxes. In this paper, we address the weaknesses of $IoU$ by introducing a generalized version as both a new loss and a new metric. By incorporating this generalized $IoU$ ($GIoU$) as a loss into the state-of-the art object detection frameworks, we show a consistent improvement on their performance using both the standard, $IoU$ based, and new, $GIoU$ based, performance measures on popular object detection benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.\n",
      "Unsupervised approaches to learning in neural networks are of substantial interest for furthering artificial intelligence, both because they would enable the training of networks without the need for large numbers of expensive annotations, and because they would be better models of the kind of general-purpose learning deployed by humans. However, unsupervised networks have long lagged behind the performance of their supervised counterparts, especially in the domain of large-scale visual recognition. Recent developments in training deep convolutional embeddings to maximize non-parametric instance separation and clustering objectives have shown promise in closing this gap. Here, we describe a method that trains an embedding function to maximize a metric of local aggregation, causing similar data instances to move together in the embedding space, while allowing dissimilar instances to separate. This aggregation metric is dynamic, allowing soft clusters of different scales to emerge. We evaluate our procedure on several large-scale visual recognition datasets, achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised transfer learning performance on object recognition in ImageNet, scene recognition in Places 205, and object detection in PASCAL VOC.\n",
      "Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, most of the existing approaches for image representation ignore the relations between images and consider each input image independently. Intuitively, relations between images can help to understand the images and maintain model consistency over related images. In this paper, we consider modeling the image-level relations to generate more informative image representations, and propose ImageGCN, an end-to-end graph convolutional network framework for multi-relational image modeling. We also apply ImageGCN to chest X-ray (CXR) images where rich relational information is available for disease identification. Unlike previous image representation models, ImageGCN learns the representation of an image using both its original pixel features and the features of related images. Besides learning informative representations for images, ImageGCN can also be used for object detection in a weakly supervised manner. The Experimental results on ChestX-ray14 dataset demonstrate that ImageGCN can outperform respective baselines in both disease identification and localization tasks and can achieve comparable and often better results than the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in a wide range of computer vision, speech recognition, and machine translation tasks. However the limits of memory bandwidth and computational power constrain the range of devices capable of deploying these modern networks. To address this problem, we propose SQuantizer, a new training method that jointly optimizes for both sparse and low-precision neural networks while maintaining high accuracy and providing a high compression rate. This approach brings sparsification and low-bit quantization into a single training pass, employing these techniques in an order demonstrated to be optimal. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracies using 4-bit and 2-bit precision for ResNet18, MobileNet-v2 and ResNet50, even with high degree of sparsity. The compression rates of 18x for ResNet18 and 17x for ResNet50, and 9x for MobileNet-v2 are obtained when SQuantizing both weights and activations within 1% and 2% loss in accuracy for ResNets and MobileNet-v2 respectively. An extension of these techniques to object detection also demonstrates high accuracy on YOLO-v3. Additionally, our method allows for fast single pass training, which is important for rapid prototyping and neural architecture search techniques. Finally extensive results from this simultaneous training approach allows us to draw some useful insights into the relative merits of sparsity and quantization.\n",

Applying these networks to images demands a high computational effort and pushes the use of state-of-the-art networks on real-time video data out of reach of embedded platforms. Many recent works focus on reducing network complexity for real-time inference on embedded computing platforms. We adopt an orthogonal viewpoint and propose a novel algorithm exploiting the spatio-temporal sparsity of pixel changes. This optimized inference procedure resulted in an average speed-up of 9.1x over cuDNN on the Tegra X2 platform at a negligible accuracy loss of <0.1% and no retraining of the network for a semantic segmentation application. Similarly, an average speed-up of 7.0x has been achieved for a pose detection DNN and a reduction of 5x of the number of arithmetic operations to be performed for object detection on static camera video surveillance data. These throughput gains combined with a lower power consumption result in an energy efficiency of 511 GOp/s/W compared to 70 GOp/s/W for the baseline.\n",
      "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly thought to recognise objects by learning increasingly complex representations of object shapes. Some recent studies suggest a more important role of image textures. We here put these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation instead when trained on \"Stylized-ImageNet\", a stylized version of ImageNet. This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560 psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions, highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.\n",
      "We present a simple and general method to train a single neural network executable at different widths (number of channels in a layer), permitting instant and adaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Instead of training individual networks with different width configurations, we train a shared network with switchable batch normalization. At runtime, the network can adjust its width on the fly according to on-device benchmarks and resource constraints, rather than downloading and offloading different models. Our trained networks, named slimmable neural networks, achieve similar (and in many cases better) ImageNet classification accuracy than individually trained models of MobileNet v1, MobileNet v2, ShuffleNet and ResNet-50 at different widths respectively. We also demonstrate better performance of slimmable models compared with individual ones across a wide range of applications including COCO bounding-box object detection, instance segmentation and person keypoint detection without tuning hyper-parameters. Lastly we visualize and discuss the learned features of slimmable networks. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/JiahuiYu/slimmable_networks\n",
      "Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have shown outstanding performance in many computer vision tasks including salient object detection. However, there still remains two issues needed to be addressed in deep learning based saliency detection. One is the lack of tremendous amount of annotated data to train a network. The other is the lack of robustness for extracting salient objects in images containing complex scenes. In this paper, we present a new architecture$ - $PDNet, a robust prior-model guided depth-enhanced network for RGB-D salient object detection. In contrast to existing works, in which RGB-D values of image pixels are fed directly to a network, the proposed architecture is composed of a master network for processing RGB values, and a sub-network making full use of depth cues and incorporate depth-based features into the master network. To overcome the limited size of the labeled RGB-D dataset for training, we employ a large conventional RGB dataset to pre-train the master network, which proves to contribute largely to the final accuracy. Extensive evaluations over five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.\n",
      "After the tremendous success of convolutional neural networks in image classification, object detection, speech recognition, etc., there is now rising demand for deployment of these compute-intensive ML models on tightly power constrained embedded and mobile systems at low cost as well as for pushing the throughput in data centers. This has triggered a wave of research towards specialized hardware accelerators. Their performance is often constrained by I/O bandwidth and the energy consumption is dominated by I/O transfers to off-chip memory. We introduce and evaluate a novel, hardware-friendly compression scheme for the feature maps present within convolutional neural networks. We show that an average compression ratio of 4.4x relative to uncompressed data and a gain of 60% over existing method can be achieved for ResNet-34 with a compression block requiring <300 bit of sequential cells and minimal combinational logic.\n",
      "We present an approach for reconfiguration of dynamic visual sensor networks with deep reinforcement learning (RL). Our RL agent uses a modified asynchronous advantage actor-critic framework and the recently proposed Relational Network module at the foundation of its network architecture. To address the issue of sample inefficiency in current approaches to model-free reinforcement learning, we train our system in an abstract simulation environment that represents inputs from a dynamic scene. Our system is validated using inputs from a real-world scenario and preexisting object detection and tracking algorithms.\n",
      "This paper proposes an enhancement of convolutional neural networks for object detection in resource-constrained robotics through a geometric input transformation called Visual Mesh. It uses object geometry to create a graph in vision space, reducing computational complexity by normalizing the pixel and feature density of objects.

The results demonstrate execution times sixteen times quicker than the fastest competitor tested, while achieving outstanding accuracy.\n",
      "Training 3D object detectors for autonomous driving has been limited to small datasets due to the effort required to generate annotations. Reducing both task complexity and the amount of task switching done by annotators is key to reducing the effort and time required to generate 3D bounding box annotations. This paper introduces a novel ground truth generation method that combines human supervision with pretrained neural networks to generate per-instance 3D point cloud segmentation, 3D bounding boxes, and class annotations. The annotators provide object anchor clicks which behave as a seed to generate instance segmentation results in 3D. The points belonging to each instance are then used to regress object centroids, bounding box dimensions, and object orientation. Our proposed annotation scheme requires 30x lower human annotation time. We use the KITTI 3D object detection dataset to evaluate the efficiency and the quality of our annotation scheme. We also test the the proposed scheme on previously unseen data from the Autonomoose self-driving vehicle to demonstrate generalization capabilities of the network.\n",
      "In this work, we present an application of domain randomization and generative adversarial networks (GAN) to train a near real-time object detector for industrial electric parts, entirely in a simulated environment. Large scale availability of labelled real world data is typically rare and difficult to obtain in many industrial settings. As such here, only a few hundred of unlabelled real images are used to train a Cyclic-GAN network, in combination with various degree of domain randomization procedures. We demonstrate that this enables robust translation of synthetic images to the real world domain. We show that a combination of the original synthetic (simulation) and GAN translated images, when used for training a Mask-RCNN object detection network achieves greater than 0.95 mean average precision in detecting and classifying a collection of industrial electric parts. We evaluate the performance across different combinations of training data.\n",
      "As it requires a huge number of parameters when exposed to high dimensional inputs in video detection and classification, there is a grand challenge to develop a compact yet accurate video comprehension at terminal devices. Current works focus on optimizations of video detection and classification in a separated fashion. In this paper, we introduce a video comprehension (object detection and action recognition) system for terminal devices, namely DEEPEYE. Based on You Only Look Once (YOLO), we have developed an 8-bit quantization method when training YOLO; and also developed a tensorized-compression method of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) composed of features extracted from YOLO. The developed quantization and tensorization can significantly compress the original network model yet with maintained accuracy. Using the challenging video datasets: MOMENTS and UCF11 as benchmarks, the results show that the proposed DEEPEYE achieves 3.994x model compression rate with only 0.47% mAP decreased; and 15,047x parameter reduction and 2.87x speed-up with 16.58% accuracy improvement.\n",
      "This paper presents a learning method for convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) for extracting features from images. CAEs can be obtained by utilizing convolutional neural networks to learn an approximation to the identity function in an unsupervised manner. The loss function based on the pixel loss (PL) that is the mean squared error between the pixel values of original and reconstructed images is the common choice for learning. However, using the loss function leads to blurred reconstructed images. A method for learning CAEs using a loss function computed from features reflecting spatial frequencies is proposed to mitigate the problem. The blurs in reconstructed images show lack of high spatial frequency components mainly constituting edges and detailed textures that are important features for tasks such as object detection and spatial matching. In order to evaluate the lack of components, a convolutional layer with a Laplacian filter bank as weights is added to CAEs and the mean squared error of features in a subband, called the spatial frequency loss (SFL), is computed from the outputs of each filter. The learning is performed using a loss function based on the SFL. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that using the SFL reduces the blurs in reconstructed images.\n",
      "Big data has had a great share in the success of deep learning in computer vision. Recent works suggest that there is significant further potential to increase object detection performance by utilizing even bigger datasets. In this paper, we introduce the EuroCity Persons dataset, which provides a large number of highly diverse, accurate and detailed annotations of pedestrians, cyclists and other riders in urban traffic scenes. The images for this dataset were collected on-board a moving vehicle in 31 cities of 12 European countries. With over 238200 person instances manually labeled in over 47300 images, EuroCity Persons is nearly one order of magnitude larger than person datasets used previously for benchmarking. The dataset furthermore contains a large number of person orientation annotations (over 211200). We optimize four state-of-the-art deep learning approaches (Faster R-CNN, R-FCN, SSD and YOLOv3) to serve as baselines for the new object detection benchmark. In experiments with previous datasets we analyze the generalization capabilities of these detectors when trained with the new dataset. We furthermore study the effect of the training set size, the dataset diversity (day- vs. night-time, geographical region), the dataset detail (i.e. availability of object orientation information) and the annotation quality on the detector performance. Finally, we analyze error sources and discuss the road ahead.\n",
      "The state of the art lung nodule detection studies rely on computationally expensive multi-stage frameworks to detect nodules from CT scans. To address this computational challenge and provide better performance, in this paper we propose S4ND, a new deep learning based method for lung nodule detection. Our approach uses a single feed forward pass of a single network for detection and provides better performance when compared to the current literature. The whole detection pipeline is designed as a single $3D$ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dense connections, trained in an end-to-end manner. S4ND does not require any further post-processing or user guidance to refine detection results. Experimentally, we compared our network with the current state-of-the-art object detection network (SSD) in computer vision as well as the state-of-the-art published method for lung nodule detection (3D DCNN). We used publically available $888$ CT scans from LUNA challenge dataset and showed that the proposed method outperforms the current literature both in terms of efficiency and accuracy by achieving an average FROC-score of $0.897$. We also provide an in-depth analysis of our proposed network to shed light on the unclear paradigms of tiny object detection.\n",

      "We present a new technique for deep reinforcement learning that automatically detects moving objects and uses the relevant information for action selection. The detection of moving objects is done in an unsupervised way by exploiting structure from motion. Instead of directly learning a policy from raw images, the agent first learns to detect and segment moving objects by exploiting flow information in video sequences. The learned representation is then used to focus the policy of the agent on the moving objects. Over time, the agent identifies which objects are critical for decision making and gradually builds a policy based on relevant moving objects. This approach, which we call Motion-Oriented REinforcement Learning (MOREL), is demonstrated on a suite of Atari games where the ability to detect moving objects reduces the amount of interaction needed with the environment to obtain a good policy. Furthermore, the resulting policy is more interpretable than policies that directly map images to actions or values with a black box neural network. We can gain insight into the policy by inspecting the segmentation and motion of each object detected by the agent. This allows practitioners to confirm whether a policy is making decisions based on sensible information.\n",
      "Modern driver assistance systems rely on a wide range of sensors (RADAR, LIDAR, ultrasound and cameras) for scene understanding and prediction. These sensors are typically used for detecting traffic participants and scene elements required for navigation. In this paper we argue that relying on camera based systems, specifically Around View Monitoring (AVM) system has great potential to achieve these goals in both parking and driving modes with decreased costs. The contributions of this paper are as follows: we present a new end-to-end solution for delimiting the safe drivable area for each frame by means of identifying the closest obstacle in each direction from the driving vehicle, we use this approach to calculate the distance to the nearest obstacles and we incorporate it into a unified end-to-end architecture capable of joint object detection, curb detection and safe drivable area detection. Furthermore, we describe the family of networks for both a high accuracy solution and a low complexity solution. We also introduce further augmentation of the base architecture with 3D object detection.\n",
      "We present a novel framework for augmenting data sets for machine learning based on counterexamples. Counterexamples are misclassified examples that have important properties for retraining and improving the model. Key components of our framework include a counterexample generator, which produces data items that are misclassified by the model and error tables, a novel data structure that stores information pertaining to misclassifications. Error tables can be used to explain the model's vulnerabilities and are used to efficiently generate counterexamples for augmentation. We show the efficacy of the proposed framework by comparing it to classical augmentation techniques on a case study of object detection in autonomous driving based on deep neural networks.\n",
      "Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been used to achieve state-of-the-art performance on many computer vision tasks (e.g., object recognition, object detection, semantic segmentation) thanks to a large repository of annotated image data. Large labeled datasets for other sensor modalities, e.g., multispectral imagery (MSI), are not available due to the large cost and manpower required. In this paper, we adapt state-of-the-art DCNN frameworks in computer vision for semantic segmentation for MSI imagery. To overcome label scarcity for MSI data, we substitute real MSI for generated synthetic MSI in order to initialize a DCNN framework. We evaluate our network initialization scheme on the new RIT-18 dataset that we present in this paper. This dataset contains very-high resolution MSI collected by an unmanned aircraft system. The models initialized with synthetic imagery were less prone to over-fitting and provide a state-of-the-art baseline for future work.\n",
      "The use of explicit object detectors as an intermediate step to image captioning - which used to constitute an essential stage in early work - is often bypassed in the currently dominant end-to-end approaches, where the language model is conditioned directly on a mid-level image embedding. We argue that explicit detections provide rich semantic information, and can thus be used as an interpretable representation to better understand why end-to-end image captioning systems work well. We provide an in-depth analysis of end-to-end image captioning by exploring a variety of cues that can be derived from such object detections. Our study reveals that end-to-end image captioning systems rely on matching image representations to generate captions, and that encoding the frequency, size and position of objects are complementary and all play a role in forming a good image representation. It also reveals that different object categories contribute in different ways towards image captioning.\n",
      "In the recent times, autoencoders, besides being used for compression, have been proven quite useful even for regenerating similar images or help in image denoising. They have also been explored for anomaly detection in a few cases. However, due to location invariance property of convolutional neural network, autoencoders tend to learn from or search for learned features in the complete image. This creates issues when all the items in the image are not equally important and their location matters. For such cases, a semi supervised solution - regional priority based autoencoder (RPAE) has been proposed. In this model, similar to object detection models, a region proposal network identifies the relevant areas in the images as belonging to one of the predefined categories and then those bounding boxes are fed into appropriate decoder based on the category they belong to. Finally, the error scores from all the decoders are combined based on their importance to provide total reconstruction error.\n",
      "A significant challenge in object detection is accurate identification of an object's position in image space, whereas one algorithm with one set of parameters is usually not enough, and the fusion of multiple algorithms and/or parameters can lead to more robust results. Herein, a new computational intelligence fusion approach based on the dynamic analysis of agreement among object detection outputs is proposed. Furthermore, we propose an online versus just in training image augmentation strategy. Experiments comparing the results both with and without fusion are presented. We demonstrate that the augmented and fused combination results are the best, with respect to higher accuracy rates and reduction of outlier influences. The approach is demonstrated in the context of cone, pedestrian and box detection for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) applications.\n",
      "This work proposed a novel learning objective to train a deep neural network to perform end-to-end image pixel clustering. We applied the approach to instance segmentation, which is at the intersection of image semantic segmentation and object detection. We utilize the most fundamental property of instance labeling -- the pairwise relationship between pixels -- as the supervision to formulate the learning objective, then apply it to train a fully convolutional network (FCN) for learning to perform pixel-wise clustering. The resulting clusters can be used as the instance labeling directly. To support labeling of an unlimited number of instance, we further formulate ideas from graph coloring theory into the proposed learning objective. The evaluation on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrates strong performance and therefore proof of the concept. Moreover, our approach won the second place in the lane detection competition of 2017 CVPR Autonomous Driving Challenge, and was the top performer without using external data.\n",
      "Supervised object detection and semantic segmentation require object or even pixel level annotations. When there exist image level labels only, it is challenging for weakly supervised algorithms to achieve accurate predictions. The accuracy achieved by top weakly supervised algorithms is still significantly lower than their fully supervised counterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised curriculum learning pipeline for multi-label object recognition, detection and semantic segmentation. In this pipeline, we first obtain intermediate object localization and pixel labeling results for the training images, and then use such results to train task-specific deep networks in a fully supervised manner. The entire process consists of four stages, including object localization in the training images, filtering and fusing object instances, pixel labeling for the training images, and task-specific network training. To obtain clean object instances in the training images, we propose a novel algorithm for filtering, fusing and classifying object instances collected from multiple solution mechanisms. In this algorithm, we incorporate both metric learning and density-based clustering to filter detected object instances. Experiments show that our weakly supervised pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in multi-label image classification as well as weakly supervised object detection and very competitive results in weakly supervised semantic segmentation on MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2012.\n",
      "Many state-of-the-art general object detection methods make use of shared full-image convolutional features (as in Faster R-CNN). This achieves a reasonable test-phase computation time while enjoys the discriminative power provided by large Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Such designs excel on benchmarks which contain natural images but which have very unnatural distributions, i.e. they have an unnaturally high-frequency of the target classes and a bias towards a \"friendly\" or \"dominant\" object scale. In this paper we present further study of the use and adaptation of the Faster R-CNN object detection method for datasets presenting natural scale distribution and unbiased real-world object frequency. In particular, we show that better alignment of the detector scale sensitivity to the extant distribution improves vehicle detection performance. We do this by modifying both the selection of Region Proposals, and through using more scale-appropriate full-image convolution features within the CNN model. By selecting better scales in the region proposal input and by combining feature maps through careful design of the convolutional neural network, we improve performance on smaller objects. We significantly increase detection AP for the KITTI dataset car class from 76.3% on our baseline Faster R-CNN detector to 83.6% in our improved detector.\n",
      "Object detection is a major challenge in computer vision, involving both object classification and object localization within a scene. While deep neural networks have been shown in recent years to yield very powerful techniques for tackling the challenge of object detection, one of the biggest challenges with enabling such object detection networks for widespread deployment on embedded devices is high computational and memory requirements. Recently, there has been an increasing focus in exploring small deep neural network architectures for object detection that are more suitable for embedded devices, such as Tiny YOLO and SqueezeDet. Inspired by the efficiency of the Fire microarchitecture introduced in SqueezeNet and the object detection performance of the single-shot detection macroarchitecture introduced in SSD, this paper introduces Tiny SSD, a single-shot detection deep convolutional neural network for real-time embedded object detection that is composed of a highly optimized, non-uniform Fire sub-network stack and a non-uniform sub-network stack of highly optimized SSD-based auxiliary convolutional feature layers designed specifically to minimize model size while maintaining object detection performance. The resulting Tiny SSD possess a model size of 2.3MB (~26X smaller than Tiny YOLO) while still achieving an mAP of 61.3% on VOC 2007 (~4.2% higher than Tiny YOLO). These experimental results show that very small deep neural network architectures can be designed for real-time object detection that are well-suited for embedded scenarios.\n",
      "The use of random perturbations of ground truth data, such as random translation or scaling of bounding boxes, is a common heuristic used for data augmentation that has been shown to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Since the design of data augmentation is largely guided by reported best practices, it is difficult to understand if those design choices are optimal. To provide a more principled perspective, we develop a game-theoretic interpretation of data augmentation in the context of object detection. We aim to find an optimal adversarial perturbations of the ground truth data (i.e., the worst case perturbations) that forces the object bounding box predictor to learn from the hardest distribution of perturbed examples for better test-time performance. We establish that the game theoretic solution, the Nash equilibrium, provides both an optimal predictor and optimal data augmentation distribution. We show that our adversarial method of training a predictor can significantly improve test time performance for the task of object detection. On the ImageNet object detection task, our adversarial approach improves performance by over 16\\% compared to the best performing data augmentation method\n",
      "Since the study of deep convolutional neural network became prevalent, one of the important discoveries is that a feature map from a convolutional network can be extracted before going into the fully connected layer and can be used as a saliency map for object detection. Furthermore, the model can use features from each different layer for accurate object detection: the features from different layers can have different properties. As the model goes deeper, it has many latent skip connections and feature maps to elaborate object detection. Although there are many intermediate layers that we can use for semantic segmentation through skip connection, still the characteristics of each skip connection and the best skip connection for this task are uncertain. Therefore, in this study, we exhaustively research skip connections of state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks and investigate the characteristics of the features from each intermediate layer. In addition, this study would suggest how to use a recent deep neural network model for semantic segmentation and it would therefore become a cornerstone for later studies with the state-of-the-art network models.\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel activity dataset which exhibits real-life and diverse scenarios of complex, temporally-extended human activities and actions. The dataset presents a set of videos of actors performing everyday activities in a natural and unscripted manner. The dataset was recorded using a static Kinect 2 sensor which is commonly used on many robotic platforms. The dataset comprises of RGB-D images, point cloud data, automatically generated skeleton tracks in addition to crowdsourced annotations. Furthermore, we also describe the methodology used to acquire annotations through crowdsourcing. Finally some activity recognition benchmarks are presented using current state-of-the-art techniques. We believe that this dataset is particularly suitable as a testbed for activity recognition research but it can also be applicable for other common tasks in robotics/computer vision research such as object detection and human skeleton tracking.\n",
      "Object detection is considered one of the most challenging problems in this field of computer vision, as it involves the combination of object classification and object localization within a scene. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to achieve superior object detection performance compared to other approaches, with YOLOv2 (an improved You Only Look Once model) being one of the state-of-the-art in DNN-based object detection methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. Although YOLOv2 can achieve real-time performance on a powerful GPU, it still remains very challenging for leveraging this approach for real-time object detection in video on embedded computing devices with limited computational power and limited memory. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Fast YOLO, a fast You Only Look Once framework which accelerates YOLOv2 to be able to perform object detection in video on embedded devices in a real-time manner. First, we leverage the evolutionary deep intelligence framework to evolve the YOLOv2 network architecture and produce an optimized architecture (referred to as O-YOLOv2 here) that has 2.8X fewer parameters with just a ~2% IOU drop. To further reduce power consumption on embedded devices while maintaining performance, a motion-adaptive inference method is introduced into the proposed Fast YOLO framework to reduce the frequency of deep inference with O-YOLOv2 based on temporal motion characteristics. Experimental results show that the proposed Fast YOLO framework can reduce the number of deep inferences by an average of 38.13%, and an average speedup of ~3.3X for objection detection in video compared to the original YOLOv2, leading Fast YOLO to run an average of ~18FPS on a Nvidia Jetson TX1 embedded system.\n",
      "Today's general-purpose deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification and object detection are trained offline on large static datasets. Some applications, however, will require training in real-time on live video streams with a human-in-the-loop. We refer to this class of problem as Time-ordered Online Training (ToOT) - these problems will require a consideration of not only the quantity of incoming training data, but the human effort required to tag and use it. In this paper, we define training benefit as a metric to measure the effectiveness of a sequence in using each user interaction. We demonstrate and evaluate a system tailored to performing ToOT in the field, capable of training an image classifier on a live video stream through minimal input from a human operator. We show that by exploiting the time-ordered nature of the video stream through optical flow-based object tracking, we can increase the effectiveness of human actions by about 8 times.\n",
      "The recent development of CNN-based image dehazing has revealed the effectiveness of end-to-end modeling. However, extending the idea to end-to-end video dehazing has not been explored yet. In this paper, we propose an End-to-End Video Dehazing Network (EVD-Net), to exploit the temporal consistency between consecutive video frames. A thorough study has been conducted over a number of structure options, to identify the best temporal fusion strategy. Furthermore, we build an End-to-End United Video Dehazing and Detection Network(EVDD-Net), which concatenates and jointly trains EVD-Net with a video object detection model. The resulting augmented end-to-end pipeline has demonstrated much more stable and accurate detection results in hazy video.\n",
      "This paper addresses the task of set prediction using deep learning. This is important because the output of many computer vision tasks, including image tagging and object detection, are naturally expressed as sets of entities rather than vectors. As opposed to a vector, the size of a set is not fixed in advance, and it is invariant to the ordering of entities within it. We define a likelihood for a set distribution and learn its parameters using a deep neural network. We also derive a loss for predicting a discrete distribution corresponding to set cardinality. Set prediction is demonstrated on the problem of multi-class image classification. Moreover, we show that the proposed cardinality loss can also trivially be applied to the tasks of object counting and pedestrian detection. Our approach outperforms existing methods in all three cases on standard datasets.\n",
      "This paper proposes an image dehazing model built with a convolutional neural network (CNN), called All-in-One Dehazing Network (AOD-Net). It is designed based on a re-formulated atmospheric scattering model. Instead of estimating the transmission matrix and the atmospheric light separately as most previous models did, AOD-Net directly generates the clean image through a light-weight CNN. Such a novel end-to-end design makes it easy to embed AOD-Net into other deep models, e.g., Faster R-CNN, for improving high-level task performance on hazy images. Experimental results on both synthesized and natural hazy image datasets demonstrate our superior performance than the state-of-the-art in terms of PSNR, SSIM and the subjective visual quality. Furthermore, when concatenating AOD-Net with Faster R-CNN and training the joint pipeline from end to end, we witness a large improvement of the object detection performance on hazy images.\n",
      "Existing region-based object detectors are limited to regions with fixed box geometry to represent objects, even if those are highly non-rectangular. In this paper we introduce DP-FCN, a deep model for object detection which explicitly adapts to shapes of objects with deformable parts. Without additional annotations, it learns to focus on discriminative elements and to align them, and simultaneously brings more invariance for classification and geometric information to refine localization. DP-FCN is composed of three main modules: a Fully Convolutional Network to efficiently maintain spatial resolution, a deformable part-based RoI pooling layer to optimize positions of parts and build invariance, and a deformation-aware localization module explicitly exploiting displacements of parts to improve accuracy of bounding box regression. We experimentally validate our model and show significant gains. DP-FCN achieves state-of-the-art performances of 83.1% and 80.9% on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 with VOC data only.\n",
      "It has been shown that most machine learning algorithms are susceptible to adversarial perturbations. Slightly perturbing an image in a carefully chosen direction in the image space may cause a trained neural network model to misclassify it. Recently, it was shown that physical adversarial examples exist: printing perturbed images then taking pictures of them would still result in misclassification. This raises security and safety concerns.   However, these experiments ignore a crucial property of physical objects: the camera can view objects from different distances and at different angles. In this paper, we show experiments that suggest that current constructions of physical adversarial examples do not disrupt object detection from a moving platform. Instead, a trained neural network classifies most of the pictures taken from different distances and angles of a perturbed image correctly. We believe this is because the adversarial property of the perturbation is sensitive to the scale at which the perturbed picture is viewed, so (for example) an autonomous car will misclassify a stop sign only from a small range of distances.   Our work raises an important question: can one construct examples that are adversarial for many or most viewing conditions? If so, the construction should offer very significant insights into the internal representation of patterns by deep networks. If not, there is a good prospect that adversarial examples can be reduced to a curiosity with little practical impact.\n",
      "In Computer Vision domain, moving Object Tracking considered as one of the toughest problem.As there so many factors associated like illumination of light, noise, occlusion, sudden start and stop of moving object, shading which makes tracking even harder problem not only for dynamic background but also for static background.In this paper we present a new object tracking algorithm based on Dominant points on tracked object using Quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) which is a new different version of PSO based on Quantum theory. The novelty in our approach is that it can be successfully applicable in variable background as well as static background and application of quantum PSO makes the algorithm runs lot faster where other basic PSO algorithm failed to do so due to heavy computation.In our approach firstly dominants points of tracked objects detected, then a group of particles form a swarm are initialized randomly over the image search space and then start searching the curvature connected between two consecutive dominant points until they satisfy fitness criteria. Obviously it is a Multi-Swarm approach as there are multiple dominant points, as they moves, the curvature moves and the curvature movement is tracked by the swarm throughout the video and eventually when the swarm reaches optimal solution , a bounding box drawn based on particles final position.Experimental results demonstrate this proposed QPSO based method work efficiently and effectively in visual object tracking in both dynamic and static environments and run time shows that it runs closely 90% faster than basic PSO.in our approach we also apply parallelism using MatLab Parfor command to show how very less number of iteration and swarm size will enable us to successfully track object.\n",
      "We describe a system to detect objects in three-dimensional space using video and inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyrometer), ubiquitous in modern mobile platforms from phones to drones. Inertials afford the ability to impose class-specific scale priors for objects, and provide a global orientation reference. A minimal sufficient representation, the posterior of semantic (identity) and syntactic (pose) attributes of objects in space, can be decomposed into a geometric term, which can be maintained by a localization-and-mapping filter, and a likelihood function, which can be approximated by a discriminatively-trained convolutional neural network. The resulting system can process the video stream causally in real time, and provides a representation of objects in the scene that is persistent: Confidence in the presence of objects grows with evidence, and objects previously seen are kept in memory even when temporarily occluded, with their return into view automatically predicted to prime re-detection.\n",
      "This paper presents a novel yet intuitive approach to unsupervised feature learning. Inspired by the human visual system, we explore whether low-level motion-based grouping cues can be used to learn an effective visual representation. Specifically, we use unsupervised motion-based segmentation on videos to obtain segments, which we use as 'pseudo ground truth' to train a convolutional network to segment objects from a single frame. Given the extensive evidence that motion plays a key role in the development of the human visual system, we hope that this straightforward approach to unsupervised learning will be more effective than cleverly designed 'pretext' tasks studied in the literature. Indeed, our extensive experiments show that this is the case. When used for transfer learning on object detection, our representation significantly outperforms previous unsupervised approaches across multiple settings, especially when training data for the target task is scarce.\n",
      "Despite enormous progress in object detection and classification, the problem of incorporating expected contextual relationships among object instances into modern recognition systems remains a key challenge. In this work we propose Information Pursuit, a Bayesian framework for scene parsing that combines prior models for the geometry of the scene and the spatial arrangement of objects instances with a data model for the output of high-level image classifiers trained to answer specific questions about the scene. In the proposed framework, the scene interpretation is progressively refined as evidence accumulates from the answers to a sequence of questions. At each step, we choose the question to maximize the mutual information between the new answer and the full interpretation given the current evidence obtained from previous inquiries. We also propose a method for learning the parameters of the model from synthesized, annotated scenes obtained by top-down sampling from an easy-to-learn generative scene model. Finally, we introduce a database of annotated indoor scenes of dining room tables, which we use to evaluate the proposed approach.\n",
      "A dominant paradigm for deep learning based object detection relies on a \"bottom-up\" approach using \"passive\" scoring of class agnostic proposals. These approaches are efficient but lack of holistic analysis of scene-level context. In this paper, we present an \"action-driven\" detection mechanism using our \"top-down\" visual attention model. We localize an object by taking sequential actions that the attention model provides. The attention model conditioned with an image region provides required actions to get closer toward a target object. An action at each time step is weak itself but an ensemble of the sequential actions makes a bounding-box accurately converge to a target object boundary. This attention model we call AttentionNet is composed of a convolutional neural network. During our whole detection procedure, we only utilize the actions from a single AttentionNet without any modules for object proposals nor post bounding-box regression. We evaluate our top-down detection mechanism over the PASCAL VOC series and ILSVRC CLS-LOC dataset, and achieve state-of-the-art performances compared to the major bottom-up detection methods. In particular, our detection mechanism shows a strong advantage in elaborate localization by outperforming Faster R-CNN with a margin of +7.1% over PASCAL VOC 2007 when we increase the IoU threshold for positive detection to 0.7.\n",
      "The current trend in object detection and localization is to learn predictions with high capacity deep neural networks trained on a very large amount of annotated data and using a high amount of processing power. In this work, we propose a new neural model which directly predicts bounding box coordinates. The particularity of our contribution lies in the local computations of predictions with a new form of local parameter sharing which keeps the overall amount of trainable parameters low. Key components of the model are spatial 2D-LSTM recurrent layers which convey contextual information between the regions of the image. We show that this model is more powerful than the state of the art in applications where training data is not as abundant as in the classical configuration of natural images and Imagenet/Pascal VOC tasks. We particularly target the detection of text in document images, but our method is not limited to this setting. The proposed model also facilitates the detection of many objects in a single image and can deal with inputs of variable sizes without resizing.\n",
      "Vision-based object detection is one of the fundamental functions in numerous traffic scene applications such as self-driving vehicle systems and advance driver assistance systems (ADAS). However, it is also a challenging task due to the diversity of traffic scene and the storage, power and computing source limitations of the platforms for traffic scene applications. This paper presents a generalized Haar filter based deep network which is suitable for the object detection tasks in traffic scene. In this approach, we first decompose a object detection task into several easier local regression tasks. Then, we handle the local regression tasks by using several tiny deep networks which simultaneously output the bounding boxes, categories and confidence scores of detected objects. To reduce the consumption of storage and computing resources, the weights of the deep networks are constrained to the form of generalized Haar filter in training phase. Additionally, we introduce the strategy of sparse windows generation to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we perform several experiments to validate the performance of our proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is both efficient and effective in traffic scene compared with the state-of-the-art.\n",
      "In most computer vision and image analysis problems, it is necessary to define a similarity measure between two or more different objects or images. Template matching is a classic and fundamental method used to score similarities between objects using certain mathematical algorithms. In this paper, we reviewed the basic concept of matching, as well as advances in template matching and applications such as invariant features or novel applications in medical image analysis. Additionally, deformable models and templates originating from classic template matching were discussed. These models have broad applications in image registration, and they are a fundamental aspect of novel machine vision or deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), which perform shift and scale invariant functions followed by classification. In general, although template matching methods have restrictions which limit their application, they are recommended for use with other object recognition methods as pre- or post-processing steps. Combining a template matching technique such as normalized cross-correlation or dice coefficient with a robust decision-making algorithm yields a significant improvement in the accuracy rate for object detection and recognition.\n",
      "In this work we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) that jointly handles low-, mid-, and high-level vision tasks in a unified architecture that is trained end-to-end. Such a universal network can act like a `swiss knife' for vision tasks; we call this architecture an UberNet to indicate its overarching nature.   We address two main technical challenges that emerge when broadening up the range of tasks handled by a single CNN: (i) training a deep architecture while relying on diverse training sets and (ii) training many (potentially unlimited) tasks with a limited memory budget. Properly addressing these two problems allows us to train accurate predictors for a host of tasks, without compromising accuracy.   Through these advances we train in an end-to-end manner a CNN that simultaneously addresses (a) boundary detection (b) normal estimation (c) saliency estimation (d) semantic segmentation (e) human part segmentation (f) semantic boundary detection, (g) region proposal generation and object detection. We obtain competitive performance while jointly addressing all of these tasks in 0.7 seconds per frame on a single GPU. A demonstration of this system can be found at http://cvn.ecp.fr/ubernet/.\n",
      "Although agreement between annotators has been studied in the past from a statistical viewpoint, little work has attempted to quantify the extent to which this phenomenon affects the evaluation of computer vision (CV) object detection algorithms. Many researchers utilise ground truth (GT) in experiments and more often than not this GT is derived from one annotator's opinion. How does the difference in opinion affect an algorithm's evaluation? Four examples of typical CV problems are chosen, and a methodology is applied to each to quantify the inter-annotator variance and to offer insight into the mechanisms behind agreement and the use of GT. It is found that when detecting linear objects annotator agreement is very low. The agreement in object position, linear or otherwise, can be partially explained through basic image properties. Automatic object detectors are compared to annotator agreement and it is found that a clear relationship exists. Several methods for calculating GTs from a number of annotations are applied and the resulting differences in the performance of the object detectors are quantified. It is found that the rank of a detector is highly dependent upon the method used to form the GT. It is also found that although the STAPLE and LSML GT estimation methods appear to represent the mean of the performance measured using the individual annotations, when there are few annotations, or there is a large variance in them, these estimates tend to degrade. Furthermore, one of the most commonly adopted annotation combination methods--consensus voting--accentuates more obvious features, which results in an overestimation of the algorithm's performance. Finally, it is concluded that in some datasets it may not be possible to state with any confidence that one algorithm outperforms another when evaluating upon one GT and a method for calculating confidence bounds is discussed.\n",
      "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance in image classification, but still show room for improvement in object-detection tasks with many categories, in particular for cluttered scenes and occlusion. Modern detection algorithms like Regions with CNNs (Girshick et al., 2014) rely on Selective Search (Uijlings et al., 2013) to propose regions which with high probability represent objects, where in turn CNNs are deployed for classification. Selective Search represents a family of sophisticated algorithms that are engineered with multiple segmentation, appearance and saliency cues, typically coming with a significant run-time overhead. Furthermore, (Hosang et al., 2014) have shown that most methods suffer from low reproducibility due to unstable superpixels, even for slight image perturbations. Although CNNs are subsequently used for classification in top-performing object-detection pipelines, current proposal methods are agnostic to how these models parse objects and their rich learned representations. As a result they may propose regions which may not resemble high-level objects or totally miss some of them. To overcome these drawbacks we propose a boosting approach which directly takes advantage of hierarchical CNN features for detecting regions of interest fast. We demonstrate its performance on ImageNet 2013 detection benchmark and compare it with state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Discovering visual knowledge from weakly labeled data is crucial to scale up computer vision recognition system, since it is expensive to obtain fully labeled data for a large number of concept categories. In this paper, we propose ConceptLearner, which is a scalable approach to discover visual concepts from weakly labeled image collections. Thousands of visual concept detectors are learned automatically, without human in the loop for additional annotation. We show that these learned detectors could be applied to recognize concepts at image-level and to detect concepts at image region-level accurately. Under domain-specific supervision, we further evaluate the learned concepts for scene recognition on SUN database and for object detection on Pascal VOC 2007. ConceptLearner shows promising performance compared to fully supervised and weakly supervised methods.\n",
      "Saliency detection has been an intuitive way to provide useful cues for object detection and segmentation, as desired for many vision and graphics applications. In this paper, we provided a robust method for salient object detection and segmentation. Other than using various pixel-level contrast definitions, we exploited global image structures and proposed a new geodesic method dedicated for salient object detection. In the proposed approach, a new geodesic scheme, namely geodesic tunneling is proposed to tackle with textures and local chaotic structures. With our new geodesic approach, a geodesic saliency map is estimated in correspondence to spatial structures in an image. Experimental evaluation on a salient object benchmark dataset validated that our algorithm consistently outperformed a number of the state-of-art saliency methods, yielding higher precision and better recall rates. With the robust saliency estimation, we also present an unsupervised hierarchical salient object cut scheme simply using adaptive saliency thresholding, which attained the highest score in our F-measure test. We also applied our geodesic cut scheme to a number of image editing tasks as demonstrated in additional experiments.\n",
      "Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision and has many applications in image processing. This paper proposes a new approach for object detection by applying scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) in an automatic segmentation algorithm. SIFT is an invariant algorithm respect to scale, translation and rotation. The features are very distinct and provide stable keypoints that can be used for matching an object in different images. At first, an object is trained with different aspects for finding best keypoints. The object can be recognized in the other images by using achieved keypoints. Then, a robust segmentation algorithm is used to detect the object with full boundary based on SIFT keypoints. In segmentation algorithm, a merging role is defined to merge the regions in image with the assistance of keypoints. The results show that the proposed approach is reliable for object detection and can extract object boundary well.\n",
      "We consider the problem of parameter estimation using weakly supervised datasets, where a training sample consists of the input and a partially specified annotation, which we refer to as the output. The missing information in the annotation is modeled using latent variables. Previous methods overburden a single distribution with two separate tasks: (i) modeling the uncertainty in the latent variables during training; and (ii) making accurate predictions for the output and the latent variables during testing. We propose a novel framework that separates the demands of the two tasks using two distributions: (i) a conditional distribution to model the uncertainty of the latent variables for a given input-output pair; and (ii) a delta distribution to predict the output and the latent variables for a given input. During learning, we encourage agreement between the two distributions by minimizing a loss-based dissimilarity coefficient. Our approach generalizes latent SVM in two important ways: (i) it models the uncertainty over latent variables instead of relying on a pointwise estimate; and (ii) it allows the use of loss functions that depend on latent variables, which greatly increases its applicability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two challenging problems---object detection and action detection---using publicly available datasets.\n",
      "The main stated contribution of the Deformable Parts Model (DPM) detector of Felzenszwalb et al. (over the Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients approach of Dalal and Triggs) is the use of deformable parts. A secondary contribution is the latent discriminative learning. Tertiary is the use of multiple components. A common belief in the vision community (including ours, before this study) is that their ordering of contributions reflects the performance of detector in practice. However, what we have experimentally found is that the ordering of importance might actually be the reverse. First, we show that by increasing the number of components, and switching the initialization step from their aspect-ratio, left-right flipping heuristics to appearance-based clustering, considerable improvement in performance is obtained. But more intriguingly, we show that with these new components, the part deformations can now be completely switched off, yet obtaining results that are almost on par with the original DPM detector. Finally, we also show initial results for using multiple components on a different problem -- scene classification, suggesting that this idea might have wider applications in addition to object detection.\n",
      "The common internal structure and algorithmic organization of object detection, detection-based tracking, and event recognition facilitates a general approach to integrating these three components. This supports multidirectional information flow between these components allowing object detection to influence tracking and event recognition and event recognition to influence tracking and object detection. The performance of the combination can exceed the performance of the components in isolation. This can be done with linear asymptotic complexity.\n",
      "Scene understanding includes many related sub-tasks, such as scene categorization, depth estimation, object detection, etc. Each of these sub-tasks is often notoriously hard, and state-of-the-art classifiers already exist for many of them. These classifiers operate on the same raw image and provide correlated outputs. It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring any changes to the inner workings of any classifier.   We propose Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models (FE-CCM), that jointly optimizes all the sub-tasks, while requiring only a `black-box' interface to the original classifier for each sub-task. We use a two-layer cascade of classifiers, which are repeated instantiations of the original ones, with the output of the first layer fed into the second layer as input. Our training method involves a feedback step that allows later classifiers to provide earlier classifiers information about which error modes to focus on. We show that our method significantly improves performance in all the sub-tasks in the domain of scene understanding, where we consider depth estimation, scene categorization, event categorization, object detection, geometric labeling and saliency detection. Our method also improves performance in two robotic applications: an object-grasping robot and an object-finding robot.\n",
      "This paper presents a new face identification system based on Graph Matching Technique on SIFT features extracted from face images. Although SIFT features have been successfully used for general object detection and recognition, only recently they were applied to face recognition. This paper further investigates the performance of identification techniques based on Graph matching topology drawn on SIFT features which are invariant to rotation, scaling and translation. Face projections on images, represented by a graph, can be matched onto new images by maximizing a similarity function taking into account spatial distortions and the similarities of the local features. Two graph based matching techniques have been investigated to deal with false pair assignment and reducing the number of features to find the optimal feature set between database and query face SIFT features. The experimental results, performed on the BANCA database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for automatic face identification.\n",
      "Since 2014 transfer learning has become the key driver for the improvement of spatial saliency prediction; however, with stagnant progress in the last 3-5 years. We conduct a large-scale transfer learning study which tests different ImageNet backbones, always using the same read out architecture and learning protocol adopted from DeepGaze II. By replacing the VGG19 backbone of DeepGaze II with ResNet50 features we improve the performance on saliency prediction from 78% to 85%. However, as we continue to test better ImageNet models as backbones (such as EfficientNetB5) we observe no additional improvement on saliency prediction. By analyzing the backbones further, we find that generalization to other datasets differs substantially, with models being consistently overconfident in their fixation predictions. We show that by combining multiple backbones in a principled manner a good confidence calibration on unseen datasets can be achieved. This new model, \"DeepGaze IIE\", yields a significant leap in benchmark performance in and out-of-domain with a 15 percent point improvement over DeepGaze II to 93% on MIT1003, marking a new state of the art on the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark in all available metrics (AUC: 88.3%, sAUC: 79.4%, CC: 82.4%).\n",
      "Learning information-rich and generalizable representations effectively from unlabeled multivariate cardiac signals to identify abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias) is valuable in real-world clinical settings but often challenging due to its complex temporal dynamics. Cardiac arrhythmias can vary significantly in temporal patterns even for the same patient ($i.e.$, intra subject difference). Meanwhile, the same type of cardiac arrhythmia can show different temporal patterns among different patients due to different cardiac structures ($i.e.$, inter subject difference). In this paper, we address the challenges by proposing an Intra-inter Subject self-supervised Learning (ISL) model that is customized for multivariate cardiac signals. Our proposed ISL model integrates medical knowledge into self-supervision to effectively learn from intra-inter subject differences. In intra subject self-supervision, ISL model first extracts heartbeat-level features from each subject using a channel-wise attentional CNN-RNN encoder. Then a stationarity test module is employed to capture the temporal dependencies between heartbeats. In inter subject self-supervision, we design a set of data augmentations according to the clinical characteristics of cardiac signals and perform contrastive learning among subjects to learn distinctive representations for various types of patients. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets were conducted. In a semi-supervised transfer learning scenario, our pre-trained ISL model leads about 10% improvement over supervised training when only 1% labeled data is available, suggesting strong generalizability and robustness of the model.\n",
      "Transfer learning aims to exploit pre-trained models for more efficient follow-up training on wide range of downstream tasks and datasets, enabling successful training also on small data. Recently, strong improvement was shown for transfer learning and model generalization when increasing model, data and compute budget scale in the pre-training. To compare effect of scale both in intra- and inter-domain full and few-shot transfer, in this study we combine for the first time large openly available medical X-Ray chest imaging datasets to reach a dataset scale comparable to ImageNet-1k. We then conduct pre-training and transfer to different natural or medical targets while varying network size and source data scale and domain, being either large natural (ImageNet-1k/21k) or large medical chest X-Ray datasets. We observe strong improvement due to larger pre-training scale for intra-domain natural-natural and medical-medical transfer. For inter-domain natural-medical transfer, we find improvements due to larger pre-training scale on larger X-Ray targets in full shot regime, while for smaller targets and for few-shot regime the improvement is not visible. Remarkably, large networks pre-trained on very large natural ImageNet-21k are as good or better than networks pre-trained on largest available medical X-Ray data when performing transfer to large X-Ray targets. We conclude that high quality models for inter-domain transfer can be also obtained by substantially increasing scale of model and generic natural source data, removing necessity for large domain-specific medical source data in the pre-training.

      "Humans are incredibly good at transferring knowledge from one domain to another, enabling rapid learning of new tasks. Likewise, transfer learning has enabled enormous success in many computer vision problems using pretraining. However, the benefits of transfer in multi-domain learning, where a network learns multiple tasks defined by different datasets, has not been adequately studied. Learning multiple domains could be beneficial or these domains could interfere with each other given limited network capacity. In this work, we decipher the conditions where interference and knowledge transfer occur in multi-domain learning. We propose new metrics disentangling interference and transfer and set up experimental protocols. We further examine the roles of network capacity, task grouping, and dynamic loss weighting in reducing interference and facilitating transfer. We demonstrate our findings on the CIFAR-100, MiniPlaces, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.\n",
      "Image-to-image (i2i) networks struggle to capture local changes because they do not affect the global scene structure. For example, translating from highway scenes to offroad, i2i networks easily focus on global color features but ignore obvious traits for humans like the absence of lane markings. In this paper, we leverage human knowledge about spatial domain characteristics which we refer to as 'local domains' and demonstrate its benefit for image-to-image translation. Relying on a simple geometrical guidance, we train a patch-based GAN on few source data and hallucinate a new unseen domain which subsequently eases transfer learning to target. We experiment on three tasks ranging from unstructured environments to adverse weather. Our comprehensive evaluation setting shows we are able to generate realistic translations, with minimal priors, and training only on a few images. Furthermore, when trained on our translations images we show that all tested proxy tasks are significantly improved, without ever seeing target domain at training.\n",
      "Transfer learning aims to learn classifiers for a target domain by transferring knowledge from a source domain. However, due to two main issues: feature discrepancy and distribution divergence, transfer learning can be a very difficult problem in practice. In this paper, we present a framework called TLF that builds a classifier for the target domain having only few labeled training records by transferring knowledge from the source domain having many labeled records. While existing methods often focus on one issue and leave the other one for the further work, TLF is capable of handling both issues simultaneously. In TLF, we alleviate feature discrepancy by identifying shared label distributions that act as the pivots to bridge the domains. We handle distribution divergence by simultaneously optimizing the structural risk functional, joint distributions between domains, and the manifold consistency underlying marginal distributions. Moreover, for the manifold consistency we exploit its intrinsic properties by identifying k nearest neighbors of a record, where the value of k is determined automatically in TLF. Furthermore, since negative transfer is not desired, we consider only the source records that are belonging to the source pivots during the knowledge transfer. We evaluate TLF on seven publicly available natural datasets and compare the performance of TLF against the performance of eleven state-of-the-art techniques. We also evaluate the effectiveness of TLF in some challenging situations. Our experimental results, including statistical sign test and Nemenyi test analyses, indicate a clear superiority of the proposed framework over the state-of-the-art techniques.\n",
      "Manufacturing industries have widely adopted the reuse of machine parts as a method to reduce costs and as a sustainable manufacturing practice. Identification of reusable features from the design of the parts and finding their similar features from the database is an important part of this process. In this project, with the help of fully convolutional geometric features, we are able to extract and learn the high level semantic features from CAD models with inductive transfer learning. The extracted features are then compared with that of other CAD models from the database using Frobenius norm and identical features are retrieved. Later we passed the extracted features to a deep convolutional neural network with a spatial pyramid pooling layer and the performance of the feature retrieval increased significantly. It was evident from the results that the model could effectively capture the geometrical elements from machining features.\n",
      "Recent papers have suggested that transfer learning can outperform sophisticated meta-learning methods for few-shot image classification. We take this hypothesis to its logical conclusion, and suggest the use of an ensemble of high-quality, pre-trained feature extractors for few-shot image classification. We show experimentally that a library of pre-trained feature extractors combined with a simple feed-forward network learned with an L2-regularizer can be an excellent option for solving cross-domain few-shot image classification. Our experimental results suggest that this simpler sample-efficient approach far outperforms several well-established meta-learning algorithms on a variety of few-shot tasks.\n",
      "Conventional Endoscopy (CE) and Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) are known tools for diagnosing gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorders. Detecting the anatomical location of GI tract can help clinicians to determine a more appropriate treatment plan, can reduce repetitive endoscopy and is important in drug-delivery. There are few research that address detecting anatomical location of WCE and CE images using classification, mainly because of difficulty in collecting data and anotating them. In this study, we present a few-shot learning method based on distance metric learning which combines transfer-learning and manifold mixup scheme for localizing endoscopy frames and can be trained on few samples. The manifold mixup process improves few-shot learning by increasing the number of training epochs while reducing overfitting, as well as providing more accurate decision boundaries. A dataset is collected from 10 different anatomical positions of human GI tract. Two models were trained using only 78 CE and 27 WCE annotated frames to predict the location of 25700 and 1825 video frames from CE and WCE, respectively. In addition, we performed subjective evaluation using nine gastroenterologists to show the necessaity of having an AI system for localization. Various ablation studies and interpretations are performed to show the importance of each step, such effect of transfer-learning approach, and impact of manifold mixup on performance. The proposed method is also compared with various methods trained on categorical cross-entropy loss and produced better results which show that proposed method has potential to be used for endoscopy image classification.\n",
      "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have so far been the de-facto model for visual data. Recent work has shown that (Vision) Transformer models (ViT) can achieve comparable or even superior performance on image classification tasks. This raises a central question: how are Vision Transformers solving these tasks? Are they acting like convolutional networks, or learning entirely different visual representations? Analyzing the internal representation structure of ViTs and CNNs on image classification benchmarks, we find striking differences between the two architectures, such as ViT having more uniform representations across all layers. We explore how these differences arise, finding crucial roles played by self-attention, which enables early aggregation of global information, and ViT residual connections, which strongly propagate features from lower to higher layers. We study the ramifications for spatial localization, demonstrating ViTs successfully preserve input spatial information, with noticeable effects from different classification methods. Finally, we study the effect of (pretraining) dataset scale on intermediate features and transfer learning, and conclude with a discussion on connections to new architectures such as the MLP-Mixer.\n",
      "Though inverse approach is computationally efficient in aerodynamic design as the desired target performance distribution is specified, it has some significant limitations that prevent full efficiency from being achieved. First, the iterative procedure should be repeated whenever the specified target distribution changes. Target distribution optimization can be performed to clarify the ambiguity in specifying this distribution, but several additional problems arise in this process such as loss of the representation capacity due to parameterization of the distribution, excessive constraints for a realistic distribution, inaccuracy of quantities of interest due to theoretical/empirical predictions, and the impossibility of explicitly imposing geometric constraints. To deal with these issues, a novel inverse design optimization framework with a two-step deep learning approach is proposed. A variational autoencoder and multi-layer perceptron are used to generate a realistic target distribution and predict the quantities of interest and shape parameters from the generated distribution, respectively. Then, target distribution optimization is performed as the inverse design optimization. The proposed framework applies active learning and transfer learning techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the framework is validated through aerodynamic shape optimizations of the airfoil of a wind turbine blade, where inverse design is actively being applied. The results of the optimizations show that this framework is sufficiently accurate, efficient, and flexible to be applied to other inverse design engineering applications.\n",
      "Class imbalance is an inherent problem in many machine learning classification tasks. This often leads to trained models that are unusable for any practical purpose. In this study we explore an unsupervised approach to address these imbalances by leveraging transfer learning from pre-trained image classification models to encoder-based Generative Adversarial Network (eGAN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this problem using GAN without needing to augment with synthesized fake images.   In the proposed approach we use the discriminator network to output a negative or positive score. We classify as minority, test samples with negative scores and as majority those with positive scores. Our approach eliminates epistemic uncertainty in model predictions, as the P(minority) + P(majority) need not sum up to 1. The impact of transfer learning and combinations of different pre-trained image classification models at the generator and discriminator is also explored. Best result of 0.69 F1-score was obtained on CIFAR-10 classification task with imbalance ratio of 1:2500.   Our approach also provides a mechanism of thresholding the specificity or sensitivity of our machine learning system. Keywords: Class imbalance, Transfer Learning, GAN, nash equilibrium\n",
      "AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.\n",
      "Surface defect detection plays an increasingly important role in manufacturing industry to guarantee the product quality. Many deep learning methods have been widely used in surface defect detection tasks, and have been proven to perform well in defects classification and location. However, deep learning-based detection methods often require plenty of data for training, which fail to apply to the real industrial scenarios since the distribution of defect categories is often imbalanced. In other words, common defect classes have many samples but rare defect classes have extremely few samples, and it is difficult for these methods to well detect rare defect classes. To solve the imbalanced distribution problem, in this paper we propose TL-SDD: a novel Transfer Learning-based method for Surface Defect Detection. First, we adopt a two-phase training scheme to transfer the knowledge from common defect classes to rare defect classes. Second, we propose a novel Metric-based Surface Defect Detection (M-SDD) model. We design three modules for this model: (1) feature extraction module: containing feature fusion which combines high-level semantic information with low-level structural information. (2) feature reweighting module: transforming examples to a reweighting vector that indicates the importance of features. (3) distance metric module: learning a metric space in which defects are classified by computing distances to representations of each category. Finally, we validate the performance of our proposed method on a real dataset including surface defects of aluminum profiles. Compared to the baseline methods, the performance of our proposed method has improved by up to 11.98% for rare defect classes.\n",
      "Handwritten character recognition (HCR) is a challenging learning problem in pattern recognition, mainly due to similarity in structure of characters, different handwriting styles, noisy datasets and a large variety of languages and scripts. HCR problem is studied extensively for a few decades but there is very limited research on script independent models. This is because of factors, like, diversity of scripts, focus of the most of conventional research efforts on handcrafted feature extraction techniques which are language/script specific and are not always available, and unavailability of public datasets and codes to reproduce the results. On the other hand, deep learning has witnessed huge success in different areas of pattern recognition, including HCR, and provides end-to-end learning, i.e., automated feature extraction and recognition. In this paper, we have proposed a novel deep learning architecture which exploits transfer learning and image-augmentation for end-to-end learning for script independent handwritten character recognition, called HCR-Net. The network is based on a novel transfer learning approach for HCR, where some of lower layers of a pre-trained VGG16 network are utilised. Due to transfer learning and image-augmentation, HCR-Net provides faster training, better performance and better generalisations. The experimental results on publicly available datasets of Bangla, Punjabi, Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu, Farsi, Tibetan, Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Nepali and Arabic languages prove the efficacy of HCR-Net and establishes several new benchmarks. For reproducibility of the results and for the advancements of the HCR research, complete code is publicly released at \\href{https://github.com/jmdvinodjmd/HCR-Net}{GitHub}.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning (RL) is well known for requiring large amounts of data in order for RL agents to learn to perform complex tasks. Recent progress in model-based RL allows agents to be much more data-efficient, as it enables them to learn behaviors of visual environments in imagination by leveraging an internal World Model of the environment. Improved sample efficiency can also be achieved by reusing knowledge from previously learned tasks, but transfer learning is still a challenging topic in RL. Parameter-based transfer learning is generally done using an all-or-nothing approach, where the network's parameters are either fully transferred or randomly initialized. In this work we present a simple alternative approach: fractional transfer learning. The idea is to transfer fractions of knowledge, opposed to discarding potentially useful knowledge as is commonly done with random initialization. Using the World Model-based Dreamer algorithm, we identify which type of components this approach is applicable to, and perform experiments in a new multi-source transfer learning setting. The results show that fractional transfer learning often leads to substantially improved performance and faster learning compared to learning from scratch and random initialization.\n",
      "Federated Learning (FL) solves many of this decade's concerns regarding data privacy and computation challenges. FL ensures no data leaves its source as the model is trained at where the data resides. However, FL comes with its own set of challenges. The communication of model weight updates in this distributed environment comes with significant network bandwidth costs. In this context, we propose a mechanism of compressing the weight updates using Autoencoders (AE), which learn the data features of the weight updates and subsequently perform compression. The encoder is set up on each of the nodes where the training is performed while the decoder is set up on the node where the weights are aggregated. This setup achieves compression through the encoder and recreates the weights at the end of every communication round using the decoder. This paper shows that the dynamic and orthogonal AE based weight compression technique could serve as an advantageous alternative (or an add-on) in a large scale FL, as it not only achieves compression ratios ranging from 500x to 1720x and beyond, but can also be modified based on the accuracy requirements, computational capacity, and other requirements of the given FL setup.\n",
      "Deep learning is gaining instant popularity in computer aided diagnosis of COVID-19. Due to the high sensitivity of Computed Tomography (CT) to this disease, CT-based COVID-19 detection with visual models is currently at the forefront of medical imaging research. Outcomes published in this direction are frequently claiming highly accurate detection under deep transfer learning. This is leading medical technologists to believe that deep transfer learning is the mainstream solution for the problem. However, our critical analysis of the literature reveals an alarming performance disparity between different published results. Hence, we conduct a systematic thorough investigation to analyze the effectiveness of deep transfer learning for COVID-19 detection with CT images. Exploring 14 state-of-the-art visual models with over 200 model training sessions, we conclusively establish that the published literature is frequently overestimating transfer learning performance for the problem, even in the prestigious scientific sources. The roots of overestimation trace back to inappropriate data curation. We also provide case studies that consider more realistic scenarios, and establish transparent baselines for the problem. We hope that our reproducible investigation will help in curbing hype-driven claims for the critical problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, and pave the way for a more transparent performance evaluation of techniques for CT-based COVID-19 detection.\n",
      "Time-series data are one of the fundamental types of raw data representation used in data-driven techniques. In machine condition monitoring, time-series vibration data are overly used in data mining for deep neural networks. Typically, vibration data is converted into images for classification using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and scalograms are the most effective form of image representation. However, the DNN classifiers require huge labeled training samples to reach their optimum performance. So, many forms of data augmentation techniques are applied to the classifiers to compensate for the lack of training samples. However, the scalograms are graphical representations where the existing augmentation techniques suffer because they either change the graphical meaning or have too much noise in the samples that change the physical meaning. In this study, a data augmentation technique named ensemble augmentation is proposed to overcome this limitation. This augmentation method uses the power of white noise added in ensembles to the original samples to generate real-like samples. After averaging the signal with ensembles, a new signal is obtained that contains the characteristics of the original signal. The parameters for the ensemble augmentation are validated using a simulated signal. The proposed method is evaluated using 10 class bearing vibration data using three state-of-the-art Transfer Learning (TL) models, namely, Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, and ResNet50. Augmented samples are generated in two increments: the first increment generates the same number of fake samples as the training samples, and in the second increment, the number of samples is increased gradually. The outputs from the proposed method are compared with no augmentation, augmentations using deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN), and several geometric transformation-based augmentations...\n",
      "Co-creative Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) refers to systems where a PCGML agent and a human work together to produce output content. One of the limitations of co-creative PCGML is that it requires co-creative training data for a PCGML agent to learn to interact with humans. However, acquiring this data is a difficult and time-consuming process. In this work, we propose approximating human-AI interaction data and employing transfer learning to adapt learned co-creative knowledge from one game to a different game. We explore this approach for co-creative Zelda dungeon room generation.\n",
      "The success of machine learning applications often needs a large quantity of data. Recently, federated learning (FL) is attracting increasing attention due to the demand for data privacy and security, especially in the medical field. However, the performance of existing FL approaches often deteriorates when there exist domain shifts among clients, and few previous works focus on personalization in healthcare. In this article, we propose FedHealth 2, an extension of FedHealth \\cite{chen2020fedhealth} to tackle domain shifts and get personalized models for local clients. FedHealth 2 obtains the client similarities via a pretrained model, and then it averages all weighted models with preserving local batch normalization. Wearable activity recognition and COVID-19 auxiliary diagnosis experiments have evaluated that FedHealth 2 can achieve better accuracy (10%+ improvement for activity recognition) and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security.\n",
      "Generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a capability natural to humans yet challenging for machines to reproduce. This is because most learning algorithms strongly rely on the i.i.d.~assumption on source/target data, which is often violated in practice due to domain shift. Domain generalization (DG) aims to achieve OOD generalization by using only source data for model learning. Since first introduced in 2011, research in DG has made great progresses. In particular, intensive research in this topic has led to a broad spectrum of methodologies, e.g., those based on domain alignment, meta-learning, data augmentation, or ensemble learning, just to name a few; and has covered various vision applications such as object recognition, segmentation, action recognition, and person re-identification. In this paper, for the first time a comprehensive literature review is provided to summarize the developments in DG for computer vision over the past decade. Specifically, we first cover the background by formally defining DG and relating it to other research fields like domain adaptation and transfer learning. Second, we conduct a thorough review into existing methods and present a categorization based on their methodologies and motivations. Finally, we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research directions.\n",
      "Recently, neural network compression schemes like channel pruning have been widely used to reduce the model size and computational complexity of deep neural network (DNN) for applications in power-constrained scenarios such as embedded systems. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-pruning has been further proposed to automate the DNN pruning process to avoid expensive hand-crafted work. However, the RL-based pruner involves a time-consuming training process and the high expense of each sample further exacerbates this problem. These impediments have greatly restricted the real-world application of RL-based auto-pruning. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient auto-pruning framework which solves this problem by taking advantage of the historical data from the previous auto-pruning process. In our framework, we first boost the convergence of the RL-pruner by transfer learning. Then, an augmented transfer learning scheme is proposed to further speed up the training process by improving the transferability. Finally, an assistant learning process is proposed to improve the sample efficiency of the RL agent. The experiments have shown that our framework can accelerate the auto-pruning process by 1.5-2.5 times for ResNet20, and 1.81-2.375 times for other neural networks like ResNet56, ResNet18, and MobileNet v1.\n",
      "In this work we consider the problem of repeated hyperparameter and neural architecture search (HNAS). We propose an extension of Successive Halving that is able to leverage information gained in previous HNAS problems with the goal of saving computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our solution is able to drastically decrease costs while maintaining accuracy and being robust to negative transfer. Our method is significantly simpler than competing transfer learning approaches, setting a new baseline for transfer learning in HNAS.\n",
      "Guidelines and principles of trustworthy AI should be adhered to in practice during the development of AI systems. This work suggests a novel information theoretic trustworthy AI framework based on the hypothesis that information theory enables taking into account the ethical AI principles during the development of machine learning and deep learning models via providing a way to study and optimize the inherent tradeoffs between trustworthy AI principles. Under the proposed framework, a unified approach to ``privacy-preserving interpretable and transferable learning'' is considered to introduce the information theoretic measures for privacy-leakage, interpretability, and transferability. A technique based on variational optimization, employing \\emph{conditionally deep autoencoders}, is developed for practically calculating the defined information theoretic measures for privacy-leakage, interpretability, and transferability.\n",
      "Traditional computer vision approaches, based on neural networks (NN), are typically trained on a large amount of image data. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its visual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the sole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these models tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their source domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the knowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that supervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The auxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective concepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector representation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function, KG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according to the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN on visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet dataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from Germany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a knowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in all experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better performance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to multiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic forgetting.\n",
      "Knowledge transferability, or transfer learning, has been widely adopted to allow a pre-trained model in the source domain to be effectively adapted to downstream tasks in the target domain. It is thus important to explore and understand the factors affecting knowledge transferability. In this paper, as the first work, we analyze and demonstrate the connections between knowledge transferability and another important phenomenon--adversarial transferability, \\emph{i.e.}, adversarial examples generated against one model can be transferred to attack other models. Our theoretical studies show that adversarial transferability indicates knowledge transferability and vice versa. Moreover, based on the theoretical insights, we propose two practical adversarial transferability metrics to characterize this process, serving as bidirectional indicators between adversarial and knowledge transferability. We conduct extensive experiments for different scenarios on diverse datasets, showing a positive correlation between adversarial transferability and knowledge transferability. Our findings will shed light on future research about effective knowledge transfer learning and adversarial transferability analyses.\n",
      "One of the main issues related to unsupervised machine learning is the cost of processing and extracting useful information from large datasets. In this work, we propose a classifier ensemble based on the transferable learning capabilities of the CLIP neural network architecture in multimodal environments (image and text) from social media. For this purpose, we used the InstaNY100K dataset and proposed a validation approach based on sampling techniques. Our experiments, based on image classification tasks according to the labels of the Places dataset, are performed by first considering only the visual part, and then adding the associated texts as support. The results obtained demonstrated that trained neural networks such as CLIP can be successfully applied to image classification with little fine-tuning, and considering the associated texts to the images can help to improve the accuracy depending on the goal. The results demonstrated what seems to be a promising research direction.\n",
      "In this paper, we hypothesize that the effects of the degree of typicality in natural semantic categories can be generated based on the structure of artificial categories learned with deep learning models. Motivated by the human approach to representing natural semantic categories and based on the Prototype Theory foundations, we propose a novel Computational Prototype Model (CPM) to represent the internal structure of semantic categories. Unlike other prototype learning approaches, our mathematical framework proposes a first approach to provide deep neural networks with the ability to model abstract semantic concepts such as category central semantic meaning, typicality degree of an object's image, and family resemblance relationship. We proposed several methodologies based on the typicality's concept to evaluate our CPM-model in image semantic processing tasks such as image classification, a global semantic description, and transfer learning. Our experiments on different image datasets, such as ImageNet and Coco, showed that our approach might be an admissible proposition in the effort to endow machines with greater power of abstraction for the semantic representation of objects' categories.\n",
      "Applying neural network (NN) methods in games can lead to various new and exciting game dynamics not previously possible. However, they also lead to new challenges such as the lack of large, clean datasets, varying player skill levels, and changing gameplay strategies. In this paper, we focus on the adversarial player strategy aspect in the game iNNk, in which players try to communicate secret code words through drawings with the goal of not being deciphered by a NN. Some strategies exploit weaknesses in the NN that consistently trick it into making incorrect classifications, leading to unbalanced gameplay. We present a method that combines transfer learning and ensemble methods to obtain a data-efficient adaptation to these strategies. This combination significantly outperforms the baseline NN across all adversarial player strategies despite only being trained on a limited set of adversarial examples. We expect the methods developed in this paper to be useful for the rapidly growing field of NN-based games, which will require new approaches to deal with unforeseen player creativity.\n",
      "Transferability estimation is an essential problem in transfer learning to predict how good the performance is when transferring a source model (or source task) to a target task. Recent analytical transferability metrics have been widely used for source model selection and multi-task learning. A major challenge is how to make transfereability estimation robust under the cross-domain cross-task settings. The recently proposed OTCE score solves this problem by considering both domain and task differences, with the help of transfer experiences on auxiliary tasks, which causes an efficiency overhead. In this work, we propose a practical transferability metric called JC-NCE score that dramatically improves the robustness of the task difference estimation in OTCE, thus removing the need for auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we build the joint correspondences between source and target data via solving an optimal transport problem with a ground cost considering both the sample distance and label distance, and then compute the transferability score as the negative conditional entropy of the matched labels. Extensive validations under the intra-dataset and inter-dataset transfer settings demonstrate that our JC-NCE score outperforms the auxiliary-task free version of OTCE for 7% and 12%, respectively, and is also more robust than other existing transferability metrics on average.\n",
      "Traditional supervised learning aims to train a classifier in the closed-set world, where training and test samples share the same label space. In this paper, we target a more challenging and realistic setting: open-set learning (OSL), where there exist test samples from the classes that are unseen during training. Although researchers have designed many methods from the algorithmic perspectives, there are few methods that provide generalization guarantees on their ability to achieve consistent performance on different training samples drawn from the same distribution. Motivated by the transfer learning and probably approximate correct (PAC) theory, we make a bold attempt to study OSL by proving its generalization error-given training samples with size n, the estimation error will get close to order O_p(1/\\sqrt{n}). This is the first study to provide a generalization bound for OSL, which we do by theoretically investigating the risk of the target classifier on unknown classes. According to our theory, a novel algorithm, called auxiliary open-set risk (AOSR) is proposed to address the OSL problem. Experiments verify the efficacy of AOSR. The code is available at github.com/Anjin-Liu/Openset_Learning_AOSR.\n",
      "Facial Expression Recognition is a commercially important application, but one common limitation is that applications often require making predictions on out-of-sample distributions, where target images may have very different properties from the images that the model was trained on. How well, or badly, do these models do on unseen target domains? In this paper, we provide a systematic evaluation of domain adaptation in facial expression recognition. Using state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques and six commonly-used facial expression datasets (three collected in the lab and three \"in-the-wild\"), we conduct extensive round-robin experiments to examine the classification accuracies for a state-of-the-art CNN model. We also perform multi-source experiments where we examine a model's ability to transfer from multiple source datasets, including (i) within-setting (e.g., lab to lab), (ii) cross-setting (e.g., in-the-wild to lab), (iii) mixed-setting (e.g., lab and wild to lab) transfer learning experiments. We find sobering results that the accuracy of transfer learning is not high, and varies idiosyncratically with the target dataset, and to a lesser extent the source dataset. Generally, the best settings for transfer include fine-tuning the weights of a pre-trained model, and we find that training with more datasets, regardless of setting, improves transfer performance. We end with a discussion of the need for more -- and regular -- systematic investigations into the generalizability of FER models, especially for deployed applications.\n",
      "Structured stochastic multi-armed bandits provide accelerated regret rates over the standard unstructured bandit problems. Most structured bandits, however, assume the knowledge of the structural parameter such as Lipschitz continuity, which is often not available. To cope with the latent structural parameter, we consider a transfer learning setting in which an agent must learn to transfer the structural information from the prior tasks to the next task, which is inspired by practical problems such as rate adaptation in wireless link. We propose a novel framework to provably and accurately estimate the Lipschitz constant based on previous tasks and fully exploit it for the new task at hand. We analyze the efficiency of the proposed framework in two folds: (i) the sample complexity of our estimator matches with the information-theoretic fundamental limit; and (ii) our regret bound on the new task is close to that of the oracle algorithm with the full knowledge of the Lipschitz constant under mild assumptions. Our analysis reveals a set of useful insights on transfer learning for latent Lipschitzconstants such as the fundamental challenge a learner faces. Our numerical evaluations confirm our theoretical findings and show the superiority of the proposed framework compared to baselines.\n",
      "The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has become universal during the past decade, which has afforded in-depth data-based research. By learning from the large amount of healthcare data, various data-driven models have been built to predict future events for different medical tasks, such as auto diagnosis and heart-attack prediction. Although EHR is abundant, the population that satisfies specific criteria for learning population-specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging to train data-hungry deep learning models. This study presents the Claim Pre-Training (Claim-PT) framework, a generic pre-training model that first trains on the entire pediatric claims dataset, followed by a discriminative fine-tuning on each population-specific task. The semantic meaning of medical events can be captured in the pre-training stage, and the effective knowledge transfer is completed through the task-aware fine-tuning stage. The fine-tuning process requires minimal parameter modification without changing the model architecture, which mitigates the data scarcity issue and helps train the deep learning model adequately on small patient cohorts. We conducted experiments on a real-world claims dataset with more than one million patient records. Experimental results on two downstream tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method: our general task-agnostic pre-training framework outperformed tailored task-specific models, achieving more than 10\\% higher in model performance as compared to baselines. In addition, our framework showed a great generalizability potential to transfer learned knowledge from one institution to another, paving the way for future healthcare model pre-training across institutions.\n",
      "Image captioning has increasingly large domains of application, and fashion is not an exception. Having automatic item descriptions is of great interest for fashion web platforms hosting sometimes hundreds of thousands of images. This paper is one of the first tackling image captioning for fashion images. To contribute addressing dataset diversity issues, we introduced the InFashAIv1 dataset containing almost 16.000 African fashion item images with their titles, prices and general descriptions. We also used the well known DeepFashion dataset in addition to InFashAIv1. Captions are generated using the Show and Tell model made of CNN encoder and RNN Decoder. We showed that jointly training the model on both datasets improves captions quality for African style fashion images, suggesting a transfer learning from Western style data.

      "This paper studies task adaptive pre-trained model selection, an underexplored problem of assessing pre-trained models for the target task and select best ones from the model zoo \\emph{without fine-tuning}. A few pilot works addressed the problem in transferring supervised pre-trained models to classification tasks, but they cannot handle emerging unsupervised pre-trained models or regression tasks. In pursuit of a practical assessment method, we propose to estimate the maximum value of label evidence given features extracted by pre-trained models. Unlike the maximum likelihood, the maximum evidence is \\emph{immune to over-fitting}, while its expensive computation can be dramatically reduced by our carefully designed algorithm. The Logarithm of Maximum Evidence (LogME) can be used to assess pre-trained models for transfer learning: a pre-trained model with a high LogME value is likely to have good transfer performance. LogME is \\emph{fast, accurate, and general}, characterizing itself as the first practical method for assessing pre-trained models. Compared with brute-force fine-tuning, LogME brings at most $3000\\times$ speedup in wall-clock time and requires only $1\\%$ memory footprint. It outperforms prior methods by a large margin in their setting and is applicable to new settings. It is general enough for diverse pre-trained models (supervised pre-trained and unsupervised pre-trained), downstream tasks (classification and regression), and modalities (vision and language).

      "The adoption of machine learning in materials science has rapidly transformed materials property prediction. Hurdles limiting full capitalization of recent advancements in machine learning include the limited development of methods to learn the underlying interactions of multiple elements, as well as the relationships among multiple properties, to facilitate property prediction in new composition spaces. To address these issues, we introduce the Hierarchical Correlation Learning for Multi-property Prediction (H-CLMP) framework that seamlessly integrates (i) prediction using only a material's composition, (ii) learning and exploitation of correlations among target properties in multi-target regression, and (iii) leveraging training data from tangential domains via generative transfer learning. The model is demonstrated for prediction of spectral optical absorption of complex metal oxides spanning 69 3-cation metal oxide composition spaces. H-CLMP accurately predicts non-linear composition-property relationships in composition spaces for which no training data is available, which broadens the purview of machine learning to the discovery of materials with exceptional properties. This achievement results from the principled integration of latent embedding learning, property correlation learning, generative transfer learning, and attention models. The best performance is obtained using H-CLMP with Transfer learning (H-CLMP(T)) wherein a generative adversarial network is trained on computational density of states data and deployed in the target domain to augment prediction of optical absorption from composition. H-CLMP(T) aggregates multiple knowledge sources with a framework that is well-suited for multi-target regression across the physical sciences.\n",
      "Machine learning is a general-purpose technology holding promises for many interdisciplinary research problems. However, significant barriers exist in crossing disciplinary boundaries when most machine learning tools are developed in different areas separately. We present Pykale - a Python library for knowledge-aware machine learning on graphs, images, texts, and videos to enable and accelerate interdisciplinary research. We formulate new green machine learning guidelines based on standard software engineering practices and propose a novel pipeline-based application programming interface (API). PyKale focuses on leveraging knowledge from multiple sources for accurate and interpretable prediction, thus supporting multimodal learning and transfer learning (particularly domain adaptation) with latest deep learning and dimensionality reduction models. We build PyKale on PyTorch and leverage the rich PyTorch ecosystem. Our pipeline-based API design enforces standardization and minimalism, embracing green machine learning concepts via reducing repetitions and redundancy, reusing existing resources, and recycling learning models across areas. We demonstrate its interdisciplinary nature via examples in bioinformatics, knowledge graph, image/video recognition, and medical imaging.\n",
      "For a target task where labeled data is unavailable, domain adaptation can transfer a learner from a different source domain. Previous deep domain adaptation methods mainly learn a global domain shift, i.e., align the global source and target distributions without considering the relationships between two subdomains within the same category of different domains, leading to unsatisfying transfer learning performance without capturing the fine-grained information. Recently, more and more researchers pay attention to Subdomain Adaptation which focuses on accurately aligning the distributions of the relevant subdomains. However, most of them are adversarial methods which contain several loss functions and converge slowly. Based on this, we present Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) which learns a transfer network by aligning the relevant subdomain distributions of domain-specific layer activations across different domains based on a local maximum mean discrepancy (LMMD). Our DSAN is very simple but effective which does not need adversarial training and converges fast. The adaptation can be achieved easily with most feed-forward network models by extending them with LMMD loss, which can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Experiments demonstrate that DSAN can achieve remarkable results on both object recognition tasks and digit classification tasks.

      "We study transfer learning in the presence of spurious correlations. We experimentally demonstrate that directly transferring the stable feature extractor learned on the source task may not eliminate these biases for the target task. However, we hypothesize that the unstable features in the source task and those in the target task are directly related. By explicitly informing the target classifier of the source task's unstable features, we can regularize the biases in the target task. Specifically, we derive a representation that encodes the unstable features by contrasting different data environments in the source task. On the target task, we cluster data from this representation, and achieve robustness by minimizing the worst-case risk across all clusters. We evaluate our method on both text and image classifications. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithm is able to maintain robustness on the target task, outperforming the best baseline by 22.9% in absolute accuracy across 12 transfer settings.

      "The knowledge of a deep learning model may be transferred to a student model, leading to intellectual property infringement or vulnerability propagation. Detecting such knowledge reuse is nontrivial because the suspect models may not be white-box accessible and/or may serve different tasks. In this paper, we propose ModelDiff, a testing-based approach to deep learning model similarity comparison. Instead of directly comparing the weights, activations, or outputs of two models, we compare their behavioral patterns on the same set of test inputs. Specifically, the behavioral pattern of a model is represented as a decision distance vector (DDV), in which each element is the distance between the model's reactions to a pair of inputs. The knowledge similarity between two models is measured with the cosine similarity between their DDVs. To evaluate ModelDiff, we created a benchmark that contains 144 pairs of models that cover most popular model reuse methods, including transfer learning, model compression, and model stealing. Our method achieved 91.7% correctness on the benchmark, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using ModelDiff for model reuse detection. A study on mobile deep learning apps has shown the feasibility of ModelDiff on real-world models.\n",

      "Recent works on ride-sharing order dispatching have highlighted the importance of taking into account both the spatial and temporal dynamics in the dispatching process for improving the transportation system efficiency. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning has advanced to the point where it achieves superhuman performance in a number of fields. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based solution for order dispatching and we conduct large scale online A/B tests on DiDi's ride-dispatching platform to show that the proposed method achieves significant improvement on both total driver income and user experience related metrics. In particular, we model the ride dispatching problem as a Semi Markov Decision Process to account for the temporal aspect of the dispatching actions. To improve the stability of the value iteration with nonlinear function approximators like neural networks, we propose Cerebellar Value Networks (CVNet) with a novel distributed state representation layer. We further derive a regularized policy evaluation scheme for CVNet that penalizes large Lipschitz constant of the value network for additional robustness against adversarial perturbation and noises. Finally, we adapt various transfer learning methods to CVNet for increased learning adaptability and efficiency across multiple cities. We conduct extensive offline simulations based on real dispatching data as well as online AB tests through the DiDi's platform. Results show that CVNet consistently outperforms other recently proposed dispatching methods. We finally show that the performance can be further improved through the efficient use of transfer learning.\n",

However, it remains a challenge for users to apply BBO methods to their problems at hand with existing software packages, in terms of applicability, performance, and efficiency. In this paper, we build OpenBox, an open-source and general-purpose BBO service with improved usability. The modular design behind OpenBox also facilitates flexible abstraction and optimization of basic BBO components that are common in other existing systems. OpenBox is distributed, fault-tolerant, and scalable. To improve efficiency, OpenBox further utilizes \"algorithm agnostic\" parallelization and transfer learning. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of OpenBox compared to existing systems.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose Domain Agnostic Meta Score-based Learning (DAMSL), a novel, versatile and highly effective solution that delivers significant out-performance over state-of-the-art methods for cross-domain few-shot learning. We identify key problems in previous meta-learning methods over-fitting to the source domain, and previous transfer-learning methods under-utilizing the structure of the support set. The core idea behind our method is that instead of directly using the scores from a fine-tuned feature encoder, we use these scores to create input coordinates for a domain agnostic metric space. A graph neural network is applied to learn an embedding and relation function over these coordinates to process all information contained in the score distribution of the support set. We test our model on both established CD-FSL benchmarks and new domains and show that our method overcomes the limitations of previous meta-learning and transfer-learning methods to deliver substantial improvements in accuracy across both smaller and larger domain shifts.\n",
      "Can the look and the feel of a website give information about the trustworthiness of an article? In this paper, we propose to use a promising, yet neglected aspect in detecting the misinformativeness: the overall look of the domain webpage. To capture this overall look, we take screenshots of news articles served by either misinformative or trustworthy web domains and leverage a tensor decomposition based semi-supervised classification technique. The proposed approach i.e., VizFake is insensitive to a number of image transformations such as converting the image to grayscale, vectorizing the image and losing some parts of the screenshots. VizFake leverages a very small amount of known labels, mirroring realistic and practical scenarios, where labels (especially for known misinformative articles), are scarce and quickly become dated. The F1 score of VizFake on a dataset of 50k screenshots of news articles spanning more than 500 domains is roughly 85% using only 5% of ground truth labels. Furthermore, tensor representations of VizFake, obtained in an unsupervised manner, allow for exploratory analysis of the data that provides valuable insights into the problem. Finally, we compare VizFake with deep transfer learning, since it is a very popular black-box approach for image classification and also well-known text text-based methods. VizFake achieves competitive accuracy with deep transfer learning models while being two orders of magnitude faster and not requiring laborious hyper-parameter tuning.\n",
      "Causal reasoning is the main learning and explanation tool used by humans. AI systems should possess causal reasoning capabilities to be deployed in the real world with trust and reliability. Introducing the ideas of causality to machine learning helps in providing better learning and explainable models. Explainability, causal disentanglement are some important aspects of any machine learning model. Causal explanations are required to believe in a model's decision and causal disentanglement learning is important for transfer learning applications. We exploit the ideas of causality to be used in deep learning models to achieve better and causally explainable models that are useful in fairness, disentangled representation, etc.\n",
      "The Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem addresses the possibility of a robot to localize itself in an unknown environment and simultaneously build a consistent map of this environment. Recently, cameras have been successfully used to get the environment's features to perform SLAM, which is referred to as visual SLAM (VSLAM). However, classical VSLAM algorithms can be easily induced to fail when either the motion of the robot or the environment is too challenging. Although new approaches based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved promising results in VSLAM, they still are unable to outperform traditional methods. To leverage the robustness of deep learning to enhance traditional VSLAM systems, we propose to combine the potential of deep learning-based feature descriptors with the traditional geometry-based VSLAM, building a new VSLAM system called LIFT-SLAM. Experiments conducted on KITTI and Euroc datasets show that deep learning can be used to improve the performance of traditional VSLAM systems, as the proposed approach was able to achieve results comparable to the state-of-the-art while being robust to sensorial noise. We enhance the proposed VSLAM pipeline by avoiding parameter tuning for specific datasets with an adaptive approach while evaluating how transfer learning can affect the quality of the features extracted.\n",
      "Explainable artificial intelligence is the attempt to elucidate the workings of systems too complex to be directly accessible to human cognition through suitable side-information referred to as \"explanations\". We present a trainable explanation module for convolutional image classifiers we call bounded logit attention (BLA). The BLA module learns to select a subset of the convolutional feature map for each input instance, which then serves as an explanation for the classifier's prediction. BLA overcomes several limitations of the instancewise feature selection method \"learning to explain\" (L2X) introduced by Chen et al. (2018): 1) BLA scales to real-world sized image classification problems, and 2) BLA offers a canonical way to learn explanations of variable size. Due to its modularity BLA lends itself to transfer learning setups and can also be employed as a post-hoc add-on to trained classifiers. Beyond explainability, BLA may serve as a general purpose method for differentiable approximation of subset selection. In a user study we find that BLA explanations are preferred over explanations generated by the popular (Grad-)CAM method.\n",
      "Reconfiguration demand is increasing due to frequent requirement changes for manufacturing systems. Recent approaches aim at investigating feasible configuration alternatives from which they select the optimal one. This relies on processes whose behavior is not reliant on e.g. the production sequence. However, when machine learning is used, components' behavior depends on the process' specifics, requiring additional concepts to successfully conduct reconfiguration management. Therefore, we propose the enhancement of the comprehensive reconfiguration management with transfer learning. This provides the ability to assess the machine learning dependent behavior of the different CPPS configurations with reduced effort and further assists the recommissioning of the chosen one. A real cyber-physical production system from the discrete manufacturing domain is utilized to demonstrate the aforementioned proposal.\n",
      "Sample efficiency and risk-awareness are central to the development of practical reinforcement learning (RL) for complex decision-making. The former can be addressed by transfer learning and the latter by optimizing some utility function of the return. However, the problem of transferring skills in a risk-aware manner is not well-understood. In this paper, we address the problem of risk-aware policy transfer between tasks in a common domain that differ only in their reward functions, in which risk is measured by the variance of reward streams. Our approach begins by extending the idea of generalized policy improvement to maximize entropic utilities, thus extending policy improvement via dynamic programming to sets of policies and levels of risk-aversion. Next, we extend the idea of successor features (SF), a value function representation that decouples the environment dynamics from the rewards, to capture the variance of returns. Our resulting risk-aware successor features (RaSF) integrate seamlessly within the RL framework, inherit the superior task generalization ability of SFs, and incorporate risk-awareness into the decision-making. Experiments on a discrete navigation domain and control of a simulated robotic arm demonstrate the ability of RaSFs to outperform alternative methods including SFs, when taking the risk of the learned policies into account.\n",
      "Anomalies represent deviations from the intended system operation and can lead to decreased efficiency as well as partial or complete system failure. As the causes of anomalies are often unknown due to complex system dynamics, efficient anomaly detection is necessary. Conventional detection approaches rely on statistical and time-invariant methods that fail to address the complex and dynamic nature of anomalies. With advances in artificial intelligence and increasing importance for anomaly detection and prevention in various domains, artificial neural network approaches enable the detection of more complex anomaly types while considering temporal and contextual characteristics. In this article, a survey on state-of-the-art anomaly detection using deep neural and especially long short-term memory networks is conducted. The investigated approaches are evaluated based on the application scenario, data and anomaly types as well as further metrics. To highlight the potential of upcoming anomaly detection techniques, graph-based and transfer learning approaches are also included in the survey, enabling the analysis of heterogeneous data as well as compensating for its shortage and improving the handling of dynamic processes.\n",
      "Deep learning play a vital role in classifying different arrhythmias using the electrocardiography (ECG) data. Nevertheless, training deep learning models normally requires a large amount of data and it can lead to privacy concerns. Unfortunately, a large amount of healthcare data cannot be easily collected from a single silo. Additionally, deep learning models are like black-box, with no explainability of the predicted results, which is often required in clinical healthcare. This limits the application of deep learning in real-world health systems. In this paper, we design a new explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) based deep learning framework in a federated setting for ECG-based healthcare applications. The federated setting is used to solve issues such as data availability and privacy concerns. Furthermore, the proposed framework setting effectively classifies arrhythmia's using an autoencoder and a classifier, both based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally, we propose an XAI-based module on top of the proposed classifier to explain the classification results, which help clinical practitioners make quick and reliable decisions. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The classifier achieved accuracy up to 94% and 98% for arrhythmia detection using noisy and clean data, respectively, with five-fold cross-validation.\n",
      "As global trends are shifting towards data-driven industries, the demand for automated algorithms that can convert digital images of scanned documents into machine readable information is rapidly growing. Besides the opportunity of data digitization for the application of data analytic tools, there is also a massive improvement towards automation of processes, which previously would require manual inspection of the documents. Although the introduction of optical character recognition technologies mostly solved the task of converting human-readable characters from images into machine-readable characters, the task of extracting table semantics has been less focused on over the years. The recognition of tables consists of two main tasks, namely table detection and table structure recognition. Most prior work on this problem focuses on either task without offering an end-to-end solution or paying attention to real application conditions like rotated images or noise artefacts inside the document image. Recent work shows a clear trend towards deep learning approaches coupled with the use of transfer learning for the task of table structure recognition due to the lack of sufficiently large datasets. In this paper we present a multistage pipeline named Multi-Type-TD-TSR, which offers an end-to-end solution for the problem of table recognition. It utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models for table detection and differentiates between 3 different types of tables based on the tables' borders. For the table structure recognition we use a deterministic non-data driven algorithm, which works on all table types. We additionally present two algorithms. One for unbordered tables and one for bordered tables, which are the base of the used table structure recognition algorithm. We evaluate Multi-Type-TD-TSR on the ICDAR 2019 table structure recognition dataset and achieve a new state-of-the-art.\n",
      "Existing multi-camera solutions for automatic scorekeeping in steel-tip darts are very expensive and thus inaccessible to most players. Motivated to develop a more accessible low-cost solution, we present a new approach to keypoint detection and apply it to predict dart scores from a single image taken from any camera angle. This problem involves detecting multiple keypoints that may be of the same class and positioned in close proximity to one another. The widely adopted framework for regressing keypoints using heatmaps is not well-suited for this task. To address this issue, we instead propose to model keypoints as objects. We develop a deep convolutional neural network around this idea and use it to predict dart locations and dartboard calibration points within an overall pipeline for automatic dart scoring, which we call DeepDarts. Additionally, we propose several task-specific data augmentation strategies to improve the generalization of our method. As a proof of concept, two datasets comprising 16k images originating from two different dartboard setups were manually collected and annotated to evaluate the system. In the primary dataset containing 15k images captured from a face-on view of the dartboard using a smartphone, DeepDarts predicted the total score correctly in 94.7% of the test images. In a second more challenging dataset containing limited training data (830 images) and various camera angles, we utilize transfer learning and extensive data augmentation to achieve a test accuracy of 84.0%. Because DeepDarts relies only on single images, it has the potential to be deployed on edge devices, giving anyone with a smartphone access to an automatic dart scoring system for steel-tip darts. The code and datasets are available.\n",
      "This paper considers the problem of differentially private semi-supervised transfer learning. The notion of membership-mapping is developed using measure theory basis to learn data representation via a fuzzy membership function. An alternative conception of deep autoencoder, referred to as Conditionally Deep Membership-Mapping Autoencoder (CDMMA) (that consists of a nested compositions of membership-mappings), is considered. Under practice-oriented settings, an analytical solution for the learning of CDMFA can be derived by means of variational optimization. The paper proposes a transfer learning approach that combines CDMMA with a tailored noise adding mechanism to achieve a given level of privacy-loss bound with the minimum perturbation of the data. Numerous experiments were carried out using MNIST, USPS, Office, and Caltech256 datasets to verify the competitive robust performance of the proposed methodology.\n",
      "With the rapid development of computing technology, wearable devices such as smart phones and wristbands make it easy to get access to people's health information including activities, sleep, sports, etc. Smart healthcare achieves great success by training machine learning models on a large quantity of user data. However, there are two critical challenges. Firstly, user data often exists in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Secondly, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this paper, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds personalized models by transfer learning. It is able to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security. Experiments demonstrate that FedHealth produces higher accuracy (5.3% improvement) for wearable activity recognition when compared to traditional methods. FedHealth is general and extensible and has the potential to be used in many healthcare applications.\n",
      "Transfer learning (TL) is a promising way to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. However, how to efficiently transfer knowledge across tasks with different state-action spaces is investigated at an early stage. Most previous studies only addressed the inconsistency across different state spaces by learning a common feature space, without considering that similar actions in different action spaces of related tasks share similar semantics. In this paper, we propose a method to learning action embeddings by leveraging this idea, and a framework that learns both state embeddings and action embeddings to transfer policy across tasks with different state and action spaces. Our experimental results on various tasks show that the proposed method can not only learn informative action embeddings but accelerate policy learning.\n",
      "Electric utilities are struggling to manage increasing wildfire risk in a hotter and drier climate. Utility transmission and distribution lines regularly ignite destructive fires when they make contact with surrounding vegetation. Trimming vegetation to maintain the separation from utility assets is as critical to safety as it is difficult. Each utility has tens of thousands of linear miles to manage, poor knowledge of where those assets are located, and no way to prioritize trimming. Feature-enhanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven effective in this problem space. Histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and Hough transforms are used to increase the salience of the linear structures like power lines and poles. Data is frequently taken from drone or satellite footage, but Google Street View offers an even more scalable and lower cost solution. This paper uses $1,320$ images scraped from Street View, transfer learning on popular CNNs, and feature engineering to place images in one of three classes: (1) no utility systems, (2) utility systems with no overgrown vegetation, or (3) utility systems with overgrown vegetation. The CNN output thus yields a prioritized vegetation management system and creates a geotagged map of utility assets as a byproduct. Test set accuracy with reached $80.15\\%$ using VGG11 with a trained first layer and classifier, and a model ensemble correctly classified $88.88\\%$ of images with risky vegetation overgrowth.\n",
      "Many machine learning methods have been recently developed to circumvent the high computational cost of the gradient-based topology optimization. These methods typically require extensive and costly datasets for training, have a difficult time generalizing to unseen boundary and loading conditions and to new domains, and do not take into consideration topological constraints of the predictions, which produces predictions with inconsistent topologies. We present a deep learning method based on generative adversarial networks for generative design exploration. The proposed method combines the generative power of conditional GANs with the knowledge transfer capabilities of transfer learning methods to predict optimal topologies for unseen boundary conditions. We also show that the knowledge transfer capabilities embedded in the design of the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the size of the training dataset compared to the traditional deep learning neural or adversarial networks. Moreover, we formulate a topological loss function based on the bottleneck distance obtained from the persistent diagram of the structures and demonstrate a significant improvement in the topological connectivity of the predicted structures. We use numerous examples to explore the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach for both seen and unseen boundary conditions in 2D.\n",
      "Transfer learning has gained attention in medical image analysis due to limited annotated 3D medical datasets for training data-driven deep learning models in the real world. Existing 3D-based methods have transferred the pre-trained models to downstream tasks, which achieved promising results with only a small number of training samples. However, they demand a massive amount of parameters to train the model for 3D medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, called Medical Transformer, that effectively models 3D volumetric images in the form of a sequence of 2D image slices. To make a high-level representation in 3D-form empowering spatial relations better, we take a multi-view approach that leverages plenty of information from the three planes of 3D volume, while providing parameter-efficient training. For building a source model generally applicable to various tasks, we pre-train the model in a self-supervised learning manner for masked encoding vector prediction as a proxy task, using a large-scale normal, healthy brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset. Our pre-trained model is evaluated on three downstream tasks: (i) brain disease diagnosis, (ii) brain age prediction, and (iii) brain tumor segmentation, which are actively studied in brain MRI research. The experimental results show that our Medical Transformer outperforms the state-of-the-art transfer learning methods, efficiently reducing the number of parameters up to about 92% for classification and\n",
      "Bayesian optimization has become a standard technique for hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms. We consider the setting where previous optimization runs are available, and we wish to transfer their outcomes to a new optimization run and thereby accelerate the search. We develop a new hyperparameter-free ensemble model for Bayesian optimization, based on a linear combination of Gaussian Processes and Agnostic Bayesian Learning of Ensembles. We show that this is a generalization of two existing transfer learning extensions to Bayesian optimization and establish a worst-case bound compared to vanilla Bayesian optimization. Using a large collection of hyperparameter optimization benchmark problems, we demonstrate that our contributions substantially reduce optimization time compared to standard Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization and improve over the current state-of-the-art for warm-starting Bayesian optimization.\n",
      "Prior work demonstrated the ability of machine learning to automatically recognize surgical workflow steps from videos. However, these studies focused on only a single type of procedure. In this work, we analyze, for the first time, surgical step recognition on four different laparoscopic surgeries: Cholecystectomy, Right Hemicolectomy, Sleeve Gastrectomy, and Appendectomy. Inspired by the traditional apprenticeship model, in which surgical training is based on the Halstedian method, we paraphrase the \"see one, do one, teach one\" approach for the surgical intelligence domain as \"train one, classify one, teach one\". In machine learning, this approach is often referred to as transfer learning. To analyze the impact of transfer learning across different laparoscopic procedures, we explore various time-series architectures and examine their performance on each target domain. We introduce a new architecture, the Time-Series Adaptation Network (TSAN), an architecture optimized for transfer learning of surgical step recognition, and we show how TSAN can be pre-trained using self-supervised learning on a Sequence Sorting task. Such pre-training enables TSAN to learn workflow steps of a new laparoscopic procedure type from only a small number of labeled samples from the target procedure. Our proposed architecture leads to better performance compared to other possible architectures, reaching over 90% accuracy when transferring from laparoscopic Cholecystectomy to the other three procedure types.\n",
      "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of deaths all over the world. Heart murmurs are the most common abnormalities detected during the auscultation process. The two widely used publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG) datasets are from the PhysioNet/CinC (2016) and PASCAL (2011) challenges. The datasets are significantly different in terms of the tools used for data acquisition, clinical protocols, digital storages and signal qualities, making it challenging to process and analyze. In this work, we have used short-time Fourier transform (STFT) based spectrograms to learn the representative patterns of the normal and abnormal PCG signals. Spectrograms generated from both the datasets are utilized to perform three different studies: (i) train, validate and test different variants of convolutional neural network (CNN) models with PhysioNet dataset, (ii) train, validate and test the best performing CNN structure on combined PhysioNet-PASCAL dataset and (iii) finally, transfer learning technique is employed to train the best performing pre-trained network from the first study with PASCAL dataset. We propose a novel, less complex and relatively light custom CNN model for the classification of PhysioNet, combined and PASCAL datasets. The first study achieves an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score of 95.4%, 96.3%, 92.4%, 97.6% and 96.98% respectively while the second study shows accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score of 94.2%, 95.5%, 90.3%, 96.8% and 96.1% respectively. Finally, the third study shows a precision of 98.29% on the noisy PASCAL dataset with transfer learning approach. All the three proposed approaches outperform most of the recent competing studies by achieving comparatively high classification accuracy and precision, which make them suitable for screening CVDs using PCG signals.\n",
      "Semantic segmentation of road scenes is one of the key technologies for realizing autonomous driving scene perception, and the effectiveness of deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) for this task has been demonstrated. State-of-art CNNs for semantic segmentation suffer from excessive computations as well as large-scale training data requirement. Inspired by the ideas of Fine-tuning-based Transfer Learning (FTT) and feature-based knowledge distillation, we propose a new knowledge distillation method for cross-domain knowledge transference and efficient data-insufficient network training, named Spirit Distillation(SD), which allow the student network to mimic the teacher network to extract general features, so that a compact and accurate student network can be trained for real-time semantic segmentation of road scenes. Then, in order to further alleviate the trouble of insufficient data and improve the robustness of the student, an Enhanced Spirit Distillation (ESD) method is proposed, which commits to exploit a more comprehensive general features extraction capability by considering images from both the target and the proximity domains as input. To our knowledge, this paper is a pioneering work on the application of knowledge distillation to few-shot learning. Persuasive experiments conducted on Cityscapes semantic segmentation with the prior knowledge transferred from COCO2017 and KITTI demonstrate that our methods can train a better student network (mIOU and high-precision accuracy boost by 1.4% and 8.2% respectively, with 78.2% segmentation variance) with only 41.8% FLOPs (see Fig. 1).\n",
      "Addressing shifts in data distributions is an important prerequisite for the deployment of deep learning models to real-world settings. A general approach to this problem involves the adjustment of models to a new domain through transfer learning. However, in many cases, this is not applicable in a post-hoc manner to deployed models and further parameter adjustments jeopardize safety certifications that were established beforehand. In such a context, we propose to deal with changes in the data distribution via guided data homogenization which shifts the burden of adaptation from the model to the data. This approach makes use of information about the training data contained implicitly in the deep learning model to learn a domain transfer function. This allows for a targeted deployment of models to unknown scenarios without changing the model itself. We demonstrate the potential of data homogenization through experiments on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST data sets.\n",
      "Stream learning refers to the ability to acquire and transfer knowledge across a continuous stream of data without forgetting and without repeated passes over the data. A common way to avoid catastrophic forgetting is to intersperse new examples with replays of old examples stored as image pixels or reproduced by generative models. Here, we considered stream learning in image classification tasks and proposed a novel hypotheses-driven Augmented Memory Network, which efficiently consolidates previous knowledge with a limited number of hypotheses in the augmented memory and replays relevant hypotheses to avoid catastrophic forgetting. The advantages of hypothesis-driven replay over image pixel replay and generative replay are two-fold. First, hypothesis-based knowledge consolidation avoids redundant information in the image pixel space and makes memory usage more efficient. Second, hypotheses in the augmented memory can be re-used for learning new tasks, improving generalization and transfer learning ability. We evaluated our method on three stream learning object recognition datasets. Our method performs comparably well or better than SOTA methods, while offering more efficient memory usage. All source code and data are publicly available https://github.com/kreimanlab/AugMem.\n",
      "The availability of abundant labeled data in recent years led the researchers to introduce a methodology called transfer learning, which utilizes existing data in situations where there are difficulties in collecting new annotated data. Transfer learning aims to boost the performance of a target learner by applying another related source data. In contrast to the traditional machine learning and data mining techniques, which assume that the training and testing data lie from the same feature space and distribution, transfer learning can handle situations where there is a discrepancy between domains and distributions. These characteristics give the model the potential to utilize the available related source data and extend the underlying knowledge to the target task achieving better performance. This survey paper aims to give a concise review of traditional and current transfer learning settings, existing challenges, and related approaches.\n",
      "Transfer learning across heterogeneous data distributions (a.k.a. domains) and distinct tasks is a more general and challenging problem than conventional transfer learning, where either domains or tasks are assumed to be the same. While neural network based feature transfer is widely used in transfer learning applications, finding the optimal transfer strategy still requires time-consuming experiments and domain knowledge. We propose a transferability metric called Optimal Transport based Conditional Entropy (OTCE), to analytically predict the transfer performance for supervised classification tasks in such cross-domain and cross-task feature transfer settings. Our OTCE score characterizes transferability as a combination of domain difference and task difference, and explicitly evaluates them from data in a unified framework. Specifically, we use optimal transport to estimate domain difference and the optimal coupling between source and target distributions, which is then used to derive the conditional entropy of the target task (task difference). Experiments on the largest cross-domain dataset DomainNet and Office31 demonstrate that OTCE shows an average of 21% gain in the correlation with the ground truth transfer accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also investigate two applications of the OTCE score including source model selection and multi-source feature fusion.\n",
      "Curriculum learning (CL) is a training strategy that trains a machine learning model from easier data to harder data, which imitates the meaningful learning order in human curricula. As an easy-to-use plug-in, the CL strategy has demonstrated its power in improving the generalization capacity and convergence rate of various models in a wide range of scenarios such as computer vision and natural language processing etc. In this survey article, we comprehensively review CL from various aspects including motivations, definitions, theories, and applications. We discuss works on curriculum learning within a general CL framework, elaborating on how to design a manually predefined curriculum or an automatic curriculum. In particular, we summarize existing CL designs based on the general framework of Difficulty Measurer+Training Scheduler and further categorize the methodologies for automatic CL into four groups, i.e., Self-paced Learning, Transfer Teacher, RL Teacher, and Other Automatic CL. We also analyze principles to select different CL designs that may benefit practical applications. Finally, we present our insights on the relationships connecting CL and other machine learning concepts including transfer learning, meta-learning, continual learning and active learning, etc., then point out challenges in CL as well as potential future research directions deserving further investigations.\n",
      "Most of unsupervised person Re-Identification (Re-ID) works produce pseudo-labels by measuring the feature similarity without considering the distribution discrepancy among cameras, leading to degraded accuracy in label computation across cameras. This paper targets to address this challenge by studying a novel intra-inter camera similarity for pseudo-label generation. We decompose the sample similarity computation into two stage, i.e., the intra-camera and inter-camera computations, respectively. The intra-camera computation directly leverages the CNN features for similarity computation within each camera. Pseudo-labels generated on different cameras train the re-id model in a multi-branch network. The second stage considers the classification scores of each sample on different cameras as a new feature vector. This new feature effectively alleviates the distribution discrepancy among cameras and generates more reliable pseudo-labels. We hence train our re-id model in two stages with intra-camera and inter-camera pseudo-labels, respectively. This simple intra-inter camera similarity produces surprisingly good performance on multiple datasets, e.g., achieves rank-1 accuracy of 89.5% on the Market1501 dataset, outperforming the recent unsupervised works by 9+%, and is comparable with the latest transfer learning works that leverage extra annotations.\n",
      "Domain generalization is a sub-field of transfer learning that aims at bridging the gap between two different domains in the absence of any knowledge about the target domain. Our approach tackles the problem of a model's weak generalization when it is trained on a single source domain. From this perspective, we build an ensemble model on top of base deep learning models trained on a single source to enhance the generalization of their collective prediction. The results achieved thus far have demonstrated promising improvements of the ensemble over any of its base learners.\n",
      "Most few-shot learning techniques are pre-trained on a large, labeled \"base dataset\". In problem domains where such large labeled datasets are not available for pre-training (e.g., X-ray, satellite images), one must resort to pre-training in a different \"source\" problem domain (e.g., ImageNet), which can be very different from the desired target task. Traditional few-shot and transfer learning techniques fail in the presence of such extreme differences between the source and target tasks. In this paper, we present a simple and effective solution to tackle this extreme domain gap: self-training a source domain representation on unlabeled data from the target domain. We show that this improves one-shot performance on the target domain by 2.9 points on average on the challenging BSCD-FSL benchmark consisting of datasets from multiple domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/cpphoo/STARTUP.\n",
      "The state-of-the-art performance on entity resolution (ER) has been achieved by deep learning. However, deep models are usually trained on large quantities of accurately labeled training data, and can not be easily tuned towards a target workload. Unfortunately, in real scenarios, there may not be sufficient labeled training data, and even worse, their distribution is usually more or less different from the target workload even when they come from the same domain.   To alleviate the said limitations, this paper proposes a novel risk-based approach to tune a deep model towards a target workload by its particular characteristics. Built on the recent advances on risk analysis for ER, the proposed approach first trains a deep model on labeled training data, and then fine-tunes it by minimizing its estimated misprediction risk on unlabeled target data. Our theoretical analysis shows that risk-based adaptive training can correct the label status of a mispredicted instance with a fairly good chance. We have also empirically validated the efficacy of the proposed approach on real benchmark data by a comparative study. Our extensive experiments show that it can considerably improve the performance of deep models. Furthermore, in the scenario of distribution misalignment, it can similarly outperform the state-of-the-art alternative of transfer learning by considerable margins. Using ER as a test case, we demonstrate that risk-based adaptive training is a promising approach potentially applicable to various challenging classification tasks.\n",
      "Interleaving learning is a human learning technique where a learner interleaves the studies of multiple topics, which increases long-term retention and improves ability to transfer learned knowledge. Inspired by the interleaving learning technique of humans, in this paper we explore whether this learning methodology is beneficial for improving the performance of machine learning models as well. We propose a novel machine learning framework referred to as interleaving learning (IL). In our framework, a set of models collaboratively learn a data encoder in an interleaving fashion: the encoder is trained by model 1 for a while, then passed to model 2 for further training, then model 3, and so on; after trained by all models, the encoder returns back to model 1 and is trained again, then moving to model 2, 3, etc. This process repeats for multiple rounds. Our framework is based on multi-level optimization consisting of multiple inter-connected learning stages. An efficient gradient-based algorithm is developed to solve the multi-level optimization problem. We apply interleaving learning to search neural architectures for image classification on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The effectiveness of our method is strongly demonstrated by the experimental results.\n",
      "Phytoparasitic nematodes (or phytonematodes) are causing severe damage to crops and generating large-scale economic losses worldwide. In soybean crops, annual losses are estimated at 10.6% of world production. Besides, identifying these species through microscopic analysis by an expert with taxonomy knowledge is often laborious, time-consuming, and susceptible to failure. In this perspective, robust and automatic approaches are necessary for identifying phytonematodes capable of providing correct diagnoses for the classification of species and subsidizing the taking of all control and prevention measures. This work presents a new public data set called NemaDataset containing 3,063 microscopic images from five nematode species with the most significant damage relevance for the soybean crop. Additionally, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model defined as NemaNet and a comparative assessment with thirteen popular models of CNNs, all of them representing the state of the art classification and recognition. The general average calculated for each model, on a from-scratch training, the NemaNet model reached 96.99% accuracy, while the best evaluation fold reached 98.03%. In training with transfer learning, the average accuracy reached 98.88\\%. The best evaluation fold reached 99.34% and achieve an overall accuracy improvement over 6.83% and 4.1%, for from-scratch and transfer learning training, respectively, when compared to other popular models.\n",
      "Breast cancer is one of the most common cause of deaths among women. Mammography is a widely used imaging modality that can be used for cancer detection in its early stages. Deep learning is widely used for the detection of cancerous masses in the images obtained via mammography. The need to improve accuracy remains constant due to the sensitive nature of the datasets so we introduce segmentation and wavelet transform to enhance the important features in the image scans. Our proposed system aids the radiologist in the screening phase of cancer detection by using a combination of segmentation and wavelet transforms as pre-processing augmentation that leads to transfer learning in neural networks. The proposed system with these pre-processing techniques significantly increases the accuracy of detection on Mini-MIAS.\n",
      "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a key technique to address sequential decision-making problems and is crucial to realize advanced artificial intelligence. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in RL by virtue of the fast development of deep neural networks. Along with the promising prospects of RL in numerous domains, such as robotics and game-playing, transfer learning has arisen as an important technique to tackle various challenges faced by RL, by transferring knowledge from external expertise to accelerate the learning process. In this survey, we systematically investigate the recent progress of transfer learning approaches in the context of deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we provide a framework for categorizing the state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches, under which we analyze their goals, methodologies, compatible RL backbones, and practical applications. We also draw connections between transfer learning and other relevant topics from the RL perspective and explore their potential challenges as well as open questions that await future research progress.\n",
      "Ceramic insulators are important to electronic systems, designed and installed to protect humans from the danger of high voltage electric current. However, insulators are not immortal, and natural deterioration can gradually damage them. Therefore, the condition of insulators must be continually monitored, which is normally done using UAVs. UAVs collect many images of insulators, and these images are then analyzed to identify those that are damaged. Here we describe AdeNet as a deep neural network designed to identify damaged insulators, and test multiple approaches to automatic analysis of the condition of insulators. Several deep neural networks were tested, as were shallow learning methods. The best results (88.8\\%) were achieved using AdeNet without transfer learning. AdeNet also reduced the false negative rate to $\\sim$7\\%. While the method cannot fully replace human inspection, its high throughput can reduce the amount of labor required to monitor lines for damaged insulators and provide early warning to replace damaged insulators.\n",
      "One of the most important problems in transfer learning is the task of domain adaptation, where the goal is to apply an algorithm trained in one or more source domains to a different (but related) target domain. This paper deals with domain adaptation in the presence of covariate shift while there exist invariances across domains. A main limitation of existing causal inference methods for solving this problem is scalability. To overcome this difficulty, we propose SCTL, an algorithm that avoids an exhaustive search and identifies invariant causal features across the source and target domains based on Markov blanket discovery. SCTL does not require to have prior knowledge of the causal structure, the type of interventions, or the intervention targets. There is an intrinsic locality associated with SCTL that makes SCTL practically scalable and robust because local causal discovery increases the power of computational independence tests and makes the task of domain adaptation computationally tractable. We show the scalability and robustness of SCTL for domain adaptation using synthetic and real data sets in low-dimensional and high-dimensional settings.\n",
      "Aided by recent advances in Deep Learning, Image Caption Generation has seen tremendous progress over the last few years. Most methods use transfer learning to extract visual information, in the form of image features, with the help of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network models followed by transformation of the visual information using a Caption Generator module to generate the output sentences. Different methods have used different Convolutional Neural Network Architectures and, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic study which compares the relative efficacy of different Convolutional Neural Network architectures for extracting the visual information. In this work, we have evaluated 17 different Convolutional Neural Networks on two popular Image Caption Generation frameworks: the first based on Neural Image Caption (NIC) generation model and the second based on Soft-Attention framework. We observe that model complexity of Convolutional Neural Network, as measured by number of parameters, and the accuracy of the model on Object Recognition task does not necessarily co-relate with its efficacy on feature extraction for Image Caption Generation task.\n",
      "Agents trained with deep reinforcement learning algorithms are capable of performing highly complex tasks including locomotion in continuous environments. We investigate transferring the learning acquired in one task to a set of previously unseen tasks. Generalization and overfitting in deep reinforcement learning are not commonly addressed in current transfer learning research. Conducting a comparative analysis without an intermediate regularization step results in underperforming benchmarks and inaccurate algorithm comparisons due to rudimentary assessments. In this study, we propose regularization techniques in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control through the application of sample elimination, early stopping and maximum entropy regularized adversarial learning. First, the importance of the inclusion of training iteration number to the hyperparameters in deep transfer reinforcement learning will be discussed. Because source task performance is not indicative of the generalization capacity of the algorithm, we start by acknowledging the training iteration number as a hyperparameter. In line with this, we introduce an additional step of resorting to earlier snapshots of policy parameters to prevent overfitting to the source task. Then, to generate robust policies, we discard the samples that lead to overfitting via a method we call strict clipping. Furthermore, we increase the generalization capacity in widely used transfer learning benchmarks by using maximum entropy regularization, different critic methods, and curriculum learning in an adversarial setup. Subsequently, we propose maximum entropy adversarial reinforcement learning to increase the domain randomization. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of these methods on simulated robots in target environments where the morphology of the robot, gravity, and tangential friction coefficient of the environment are altered.\n",
      "Computer-aided detection (CAD) of benign and malignant breast lesions becomes increasingly essential in breast ultrasound (US) imaging. The CAD systems rely on imaging features identified by the medical experts for their performance, whereas deep learning (DL) methods automatically extract features from the data. The challenge of the DL is the insufficiency of breast US images available to train the DL models. Here, we present an ensemble transfer learning model to classify benign and malignant breast tumors using B-mode breast US (B-US) and strain elastography breast US (SE-US) images. This model combines semantic features from AlexNet & ResNet models to classify benign from malignant tumors. We use both B-US and SE-US images to train the model and classify the tumors. We retrospectively gathered 85 patients' data, with 42 benign and 43 malignant cases confirmed with the biopsy. Each patient had multiple B-US and their corresponding SE-US images, and the total dataset contained 261 B-US images and 261 SE-US images. Experimental results show that our ensemble model achieves a sensitivity of 88.89% and specificity of 91.10%. These diagnostic performances of the proposed method are equivalent to or better than manual identification. Thus, our proposed ensemble learning method would facilitate detecting early breast cancer, reliably improving patient care.\n",
      "The published literature on topology optimization has exploded over the last two decades to include methods that use shape and topological derivatives or evolutionary algorithms formulated on various geometric representations and parametrizations. One of the key challenges of all these methods is the massive computational cost associated with 3D topology optimization problems. We introduce a transfer learning method based on a convolutional neural network that (1) can handle high-resolution 3D design domains of various shapes and topologies; (2) supports real-time design space explorations as the domain and boundary conditions change; (3) requires a much smaller set of high-resolution examples for the improvement of learning in a new task compared to traditional deep learning networks; (4) is multiple orders of magnitude more efficient than the established gradient-based methods, such as SIMP. We provide numerous 2D and 3D examples to showcase the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed approach, including for design domains that are unseen to our source network, as well as the generalization capabilities of the transfer learning-based approach. Our experiments achieved an average binary accuracy of around 95% at real-time prediction rates. These properties, in turn, suggest that the proposed transfer-learning method may serve as the first practical underlying framework for real-time 3D design exploration based on topology optimization\n",
      "Deep learning compiler frameworks are gaining ground as a more portable back-end for deep learning applications on increasingly diverse hardware. However, they face the daunting challenge of matching performance offered by hand-tuned target-specific libraries. While auto-tuning frameworks with statistical cost models can provide dynamic and efficient code optimization, they suffer from large space exploration and cost model training overheads. This paper proposes MetaTune, a meta-learning based cost model that more quickly and accurately predicts the performance of optimized codes with pre-trained model parameters. MetaTune encodes convolution kernel codes as structurally similar graphs to facilitate meta-learning, meta-trains a GNN model with a very small input data set, and then predicts optimization parameters for unseen convolution operations with varying sizes and structures during compilation. The resulting framework with MetaTune provides 8 to 13% better inference time on average for four CNN models with comparable or lower optimization time while outperforming transfer learning by 10% in cross-platform cases.\n",
      "Due to limited evidence and complex causes of regional climate change, the confidence in predicting fluvial floods remains low. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms intrinsic to geo-spatiotemporal information is crucial to improve the prediction accuracy. This paper demonstrates a hybrid neural network architecture - HydroDeep, that couples a process-based hydro-ecological model with a combination of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network. HydroDeep outperforms the independent CNN's and LSTM's performance by 1.6% and 10.5% respectively in Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Also, we show that HydroDeep pre-trained in one region is adept at passing on its knowledge to distant places via unique transfer learning approaches that minimize HydroDeep's training duration for a new region by learning its regional geo-spatiotemporal features in a reduced number of iterations.\n",
      "The cross-subject application of EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) has always been limited by large individual difference and complex characteristics that are difficult to perceive. Therefore, it takes a long time to collect the training data of each user for calibration. Even transfer learning method pre-training with amounts of subject-independent data cannot decode different EEG signal categories without enough subject-specific data. Hence, we proposed a cross-subject EEG classification framework with a generative adversarial networks (GANs) based method named common spatial GAN (CS-GAN), which used adversarial training between a generator and a discriminator to obtain high-quality data for augmentation. A particular module in the discriminator was employed to maintain the spatial features of the EEG signals and increase the difference between different categories, with two losses for further enhancement. Through adaptive training with sufficient augmentation data, our cross-subject classification accuracy yielded a significant improvement of 15.85% than leave-one subject-out (LOO) test and 8.57% than just adapting 100 original samples on the dataset 2a of BCI competition IV. Moreover, We designed a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based classification method as a benchmark with a similar spatial enhancement idea, which achieved remarkable results to classify motor imagery EEG data. In summary, our framework provides a promising way to deal with the cross-subject problem and promote the practical application of BCI.\n",
      "A wide range of reinforcement learning (RL) problems - including robustness, transfer learning, unsupervised RL, and emergent complexity - require specifying a distribution of tasks or environments in which a policy will be trained. However, creating a useful distribution of environments is error prone, and takes a significant amount of developer time and effort. We propose Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) as an alternative paradigm, where developers provide environments with unknown parameters, and these parameters are used to automatically produce a distribution over valid, solvable environments. Existing approaches to automatically generating environments suffer from common failure modes: domain randomization cannot generate structure or adapt the difficulty of the environment to the agent's learning progress, and minimax adversarial training leads to worst-case environments that are often unsolvable. To generate structured, solvable environments for our protagonist agent, we introduce a second, antagonist agent that is allied with the environment-generating adversary. The adversary is motivated to generate environments which maximize regret, defined as the difference between the protagonist and antagonist agent's return. We call our technique Protagonist Antagonist Induced Regret Environment Design (PAIRED). Our experiments demonstrate that PAIRED produces a natural curriculum of increasingly complex environments, and PAIRED agents achieve higher zero-shot transfer performance when tested in highly novel environments.\n",
      "Nowadays, sensors play a major role in several contexts like science, industry and daily life which benefit of their use. However, the retrieved information must be reliable. Anomalies in the behavior of sensors can give rise to critical consequences such as ruining a scientific project or jeopardizing the quality of the production in industrial production lines. One of the more subtle kind of anomalies are uncalibrations. An uncalibration is said to take place when the sensor is not adjusted or standardized by calibration according to a ground truth value. In this work, an online machine-learning based uncalibration detector for temperature, humidity and pressure sensors was developed. This solution integrates an Artificial Neural Network as main component which learns from the behavior of the sensors under calibrated conditions. Then, after trained and deployed, it detects uncalibrations once they take place. The obtained results show that the proposed solution is able to detect uncalibrations for deviation values of 0.25 degrees, 1% RH and 1.5 Pa, respectively. This solution can be adapted to different contexts by means of transfer learning, whose application allows for the addition of new sensors, the deployment into new environments and the retraining of the model with minimum amounts of data.\n",
      "Injecting human knowledge is an effective way to accelerate reinforcement learning (RL). However, these methods are underexplored. This paper presents our discovery that an abstract forward model (Thought-game (TG)) combined with transfer learning is an effective way. We take StarCraft II as the study environment. With the help of a designed TG, the agent can learn a 99\\% win-rate on a 64$\\times$64 map against the Level-7 built-in AI, using only 1.08 hours in a single commercial machine. We also show that the TG method is not as restrictive as it was thought to be. It can work with roughly designed TGs, and can also be useful when the environment changes. Comparing with previous model-based RL, we show TG is more effective. We also present a TG hypothesis that gives the influence of fidelity levels of TG. For real games that have unequal state and action spaces, we proposed a novel XfrNet of which usefulness is validated while achieving a 90\\% win-rate against the cheating Level-10 AI. We argue the TG method might shed light on further studies of efficient RL with human knowledge.\n",
      "Visual steel surface defect detection is an essential step in steel sheet manufacturing. Several machine learning-based automated visual inspection (AVI) methods have been studied in recent years. However, most steel manufacturing industries still use manual visual inspection due to training time and inaccuracies involved with AVI methods. Automatic steel defect detection methods could be useful in less expensive and faster quality control and feedback. But preparing the annotated training data for segmentation and classification could be a costly process. In this work, we propose to use the Transfer Learning-based U-Net (TLU-Net) framework for steel surface defect detection. We use a U-Net architecture as the base and explore two kinds of encoders: ResNet and DenseNet. We compare these nets' performance using random initialization and the pre-trained networks trained using the ImageNet data set. The experiments are performed using Severstal data. The results demonstrate that the transfer learning performs 5% (absolute) better than that of the random initialization in defect classification. We found that the transfer learning performs 26% (relative) better than that of the random initialization in defect segmentation. We also found the gain of transfer learning increases as the training data decreases, and the convergence rate with transfer learning is better than that of the random initialization.\n",
      "Accurate and reliable state of charge (SoC) estimation becomes increasingly important to provide a stable and efficient environment for Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) powered devices. Most data-driven SoC models are built for a fixed ambient temperature, which neglect the high sensitivity of LiBs to temperature and may cause severe prediction errors. Nevertheless, a systematic evaluation of the impact of temperature on SoC estimation and ways for a prompt adjustment of the estimation model to new temperatures using limited data have been hardly discussed. To solve these challenges, a novel SoC estimation method is proposed by exploiting temporal dynamics of measurements and transferring consistent estimation ability among different temperatures. First, temporal dynamics, which is presented by correlations between the past fluctuation and the future motion, is extracted using canonical variate analysis. Next, two models, including a reference SoC estimation model and an estimation ability monitoring model, are developed with temporal dynamics. The monitoring model provides a path to quantitatively evaluate the influences of temperature on SoC estimation ability. After that, once the inability of the reference SoC estimation model is detected, consistent temporal dynamics between temperatures are selected for transfer learning. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is verified through a benchmark. Our proposed method not only reduces prediction errors at fixed temperatures (e.g., reduced by 24.35% at -20{\\deg}C, 49.82% at 25{\\deg}C) but also improves prediction accuracies at new temperatures.\n",
      "Transfer reinforcement learning aims to improve the sample efficiency of solving unseen new tasks by leveraging experiences obtained from previous tasks. We consider the setting where all tasks (MDPs) share the same environment dynamic except reward function. In this setting, the MDP dynamic is a good knowledge to transfer, which can be inferred by uniformly random policy. However, trajectories generated by uniform random policy are not useful for policy improvement, which impairs the sample efficiency severely. Instead, we observe that the binary MDP dynamic can be inferred from trajectories of any policy which avoids the need of uniform random policy. As the binary MDP dynamic contains the state structure shared over all tasks we believe it is suitable to transfer. Built on this observation, we introduce a method to infer the binary MDP dynamic on-line and at the same time utilize it to guide state embedding learning, which is then transferred to new tasks. We keep state embedding learning and policy learning separately. As a result, the learned state embedding is task and policy agnostic which makes it ideal for transfer learning. In addition, to facilitate the exploration over the state space, we propose a novel intrinsic reward based on the inferred binary MDP dynamic. Our method can be used out-of-box in combination with model-free RL algorithms. We show two instances on the basis of \\algo{DQN} and \\algo{A2C}. Empirical results of intensive experiments show the advantage of our proposed method in various transfer learning tasks.\n",
      "Dental caries is one of the most chronic diseases involving the majority of the population during their lifetime. Caries lesions are typically diagnosed by radiologists relying only on their visual inspection to detect via dental x-rays. In many cases, dental caries is hard to identify using x-rays and can be misinterpreted as shadows due to different reasons such as low image quality. Hence, developing a decision support system for caries detection has been a topic of interest in recent years. Here, we propose an automatic diagnosis system to detect dental caries in Panoramic images for the first time, to the best of authors' knowledge. The proposed model benefits from various pretrained deep learning models through transfer learning to extract relevant features from x-rays and uses a capsule network to draw prediction results. On a dataset of 470 Panoramic images used for features extraction, including 240 labeled images for classification, our model achieved an accuracy score of 86.05\\% on the test set. The obtained score demonstrates acceptable detection performance and an increase in caries detection speed, as long as the challenges of using Panoramic x-rays of real patients are taken into account. Among images with caries lesions in the test set, our model acquired recall scores of 69.44\\% and 90.52\\% for mild and severe ones, confirming the fact that severe caries spots are more straightforward to detect and efficient mild caries detection needs a more robust and larger dataset. Considering the novelty of current research study as using Panoramic images, this work is a step towards developing a fully automated efficient decision support system to assist domain experts.\n",
      "We propose a cross-domain latent modulation mechanism within a variational autoencoders (VAE) framework to enable improved transfer learning. Our key idea is to procure deep representations from one data domain and use it as perturbation to the reparameterization of the latent variable in another domain. Specifically, deep representations of the source and target domains are first extracted by a unified inference model and aligned by employing gradient reversal. Second, the learned deep representations are cross-modulated to the latent encoding of the alternate domain. The consistency between the reconstruction from the modulated latent encoding and the generation using deep representation samples is then enforced in order to produce inter-class alignment in the latent space. We apply the proposed model to a number of transfer learning tasks including unsupervised domain adaptation and image-toimage translation. Experimental results show that our model gives competitive performance.\n",
      "With the prevalence of Diabetes, the Diabetes Mellitus Retinopathy (DR) is becoming a major health problem across the world. The long-term medical complications arising due to DR have a significant impact on the patient as well as the society, as the disease mostly affects individuals in their most productive years. Early detection and treatment can help reduce the extent of damage to the patients. The rise of Convolutional Neural Networks for predictive analysis in the medical field paves the way for a robust solution to DR detection. This paper studies the performance of several highly efficient and scalable CNN architectures for Diabetic Retinopathy Classification with the help of Transfer Learning. The research focuses on VGG16, Resnet50 V2 and EfficientNet B0 models. The classification performance is analyzed using several performance metrics including True Positive Rate, False Positive Rate, Accuracy, etc. Also, several performance graphs are plotted for visualizing the architecture performance including Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, etc. The results indicate that Transfer Learning with ImageNet weights using VGG 16 model demonstrates the best classification performance with the best Accuracy of 95%. It is closely followed by ResNet50 V2 architecture with the best Accuracy of 93%. This paper shows that predictive analysis of DR from retinal images is achieved with Transfer Learning on Convolutional Neural Networks.\n",
      "This paper addresses the problem of dense depth predictions from sparse distance sensor data and a single camera image on challenging weather conditions. This work explores the significance of different sensor modalities such as camera, Radar, and Lidar for estimating depth by applying Deep Learning approaches. Although Lidar has higher depth-sensing abilities than Radar and has been integrated with camera images in lots of previous works, depth estimation using CNN's on the fusion of robust Radar distance data and camera images has not been explored much. In this work, a deep regression network is proposed utilizing a transfer learning approach consisting of an encoder where a high performing pre-trained model has been used to initialize it for extracting dense features and a decoder for upsampling and predicting desired depth. The results are demonstrated on Nuscenes, KITTI, and a Synthetic dataset which was created using the CARLA simulator. Also, top-view zoom-camera images captured from the crane on a construction site are evaluated to estimate the distance of the crane boom carrying heavy loads from the ground to show the usability in safety-critical applications.\n",
      "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successful in representing the fully-connected inferencing ability perceived to be seen in the human brain: they take full advantage of the hierarchy-style patterns commonly seen in complex data and develop more patterns using simple features. Countless implementations of CNNs have shown how strong their ability is to learn these complex patterns, particularly in the realm of image classification. However, the cost of getting a high performance CNN to a so-called \"state of the art\" level is computationally costly. Even when using transfer learning, which utilize the very deep layers from models such as MobileNetV2, CNNs still take a great amount of time and resources. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, can be implemented in a multi-class classification method to increase separability of class features while not needing a high performance system to do so for image classification. Similarly, we also believe LDA has great promise in performing well. In this paper, we discuss our process of developing a robust CNN for food classification as well as our effective implementation of multi-class LDA and prove that (1) CNN is superior to LDA for image classification and (2) why LDA should not be left out of the races for image classification, particularly for binary cases.\n",
      "Automatic detection and recognition of banknotes can be a very useful technology for people with visual difficulties and also for the banks itself by providing efficient management for handling different paper currencies. Lightweight models can easily be integrated into any handy IoT based gadgets/devices. This article presents our experiments on several state-of-the-art deep learning methods based on Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network architectures combining with transfer learning.

      "This paper concerns the use of objectness measures to improve the calibration performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have proven to be very good classifiers and generally localize objects well; however, the loss functions typically used to train classification CNNs do not penalize inability to localize an object, nor do they take into account an object's relative size in the given image. During training on ImageNet-1K almost all approaches use random crops on the images and this transformation sometimes provides the CNN with background only samples. This causes the classifiers to depend on context. Context dependence is harmful for safety-critical applications. We present a novel approach to classification that combines the ideas of objectness and label smoothing during training. Unlike previous methods, we compute a smoothing factor that is \\emph{adaptive} based on relative object size within an image. This causes our approach to produce confidences that are grounded in the size of the object being classified instead of relying on context to make the correct predictions. We present extensive results using ImageNet to demonstrate that CNNs trained using adaptive label smoothing are much less likely to be overconfident in their predictions. We show qualitative results using class activation maps and quantitative results using classification and transfer learning tasks. Our approach is able to produce an order of magnitude reduction in confidence when predicting on context only images when compared to baselines. Using transfer learning, we gain 2.1mAP on MS COCO compared to the hard label approach.\n",
      "While many deep learning methods have seen significant success in tackling the problem of domain adaptation and few-shot learning separately, far fewer methods are able to jointly tackle both problems in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL). This problem is exacerbated under sharp domain shifts that typify common computer vision applications. In this paper, we present a novel, flexible and effective method to address the CD-FSL problem. Our method, called Score-based Meta Transfer-Learning (SB-MTL), combines transfer-learning and meta-learning by using a MAML-optimized feature encoder and a score-based Graph Neural Network. First, we have a feature encoder with specific layers designed to be fine-tuned. To do so, we apply a first-order MAML algorithm to find good initializations. Second, instead of directly taking the classification scores after fine-tuning, we interpret the scores as coordinates by mapping the pre-softmax classification scores onto a metric space. Subsequently, we apply a Graph Neural Network to propagate label information from the support set to the query set in our score-based metric space. We test our model on the Broader Study of Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (BSCD-FSL) benchmark, which includes a range of target domains with highly varying dissimilarity to the miniImagenet source domain. We observe significant improvements in accuracy across 5, 20 and 50 shot, and on the four target domains. In terms of average accuracy, our model outperforms previous transfer-learning methods by 5.93% and previous meta-learning methods by 14.28%.\n",
      "Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in the past few years. Highly complex sequential decision making problems have been solved in tasks such as game playing and robotics. Unfortunately, the sample complexity of most deep reinforcement learning methods is high, precluding their use in some important applications. Model-based reinforcement learning creates an explicit model of the environment dynamics to reduce the need for environment samples. Current deep learning methods use high-capacity networks to solve high-dimensional problems. Unfortunately, high-capacity models typically require many samples, negating the potential benefit of lower sample complexity in model-based methods. A challenge for deep model-based methods is therefore to achieve high predictive power while maintaining low sample complexity. In recent years, many model-based methods have been introduced to address this challenge. In this paper, we survey the contemporary model-based landscape. First we discuss definitions and relations to other fields. We propose a taxonomy based on three approaches: using explicit planning on given transitions, using explicit planning on learned transitions, and end-to-end learning of both planning and transitions. We use these approaches to organize a comprehensive overview of important recent developments such as latent models. We describe methods and benchmarks, and we suggest directions for future work for each of the approaches. Among promising research directions are curriculum learning, uncertainty modeling, and use of latent models for transfer learning.\n",
      "Recent advances in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) have created unprecedented opportunities for intelligent automation, where a machine can autonomously learn an optimal policy for performing a given task. However, current deep RL algorithms predominantly specialize in a narrow range of tasks, are sample inefficient, and lack sufficient stability, which in turn hinder their industrial adoption. This article tackles this limitation by developing and testing a Hyper-Actor Soft Actor-Critic (HASAC) RL framework based on the notions of task modularization and transfer learning. The goal of the proposed HASAC is to enhance the adaptability of an agent to new tasks by transferring the learned policies of former tasks to the new task via a \"hyper-actor\". The HASAC framework is tested on a new virtual robotic manipulation benchmark, Meta-World. Numerical experiments show superior performance by HASAC over state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms in terms of reward value, success rate, and task completion time.\n",
      "The emergence of COVID-19 has necessitated many efforts by the scientific community for its proper management. An urgent clinical reaction is required in the face of the unending devastation being caused by the pandemic. These efforts include technological innovations for improvement in screening, treatment, vaccine development, contact tracing and, survival prediction. The use of Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be sought in all of the above-mentioned spheres. This paper aims to review the role of Deep Learning and Artificial intelligence in various aspects of the overall COVID-19 management and particularly for COVID-19 detection and classification. The DL models are developed to analyze clinical modalities like CT scans and X-Ray images of patients and predict their pathological condition. A DL model aims to detect the COVID-19 pneumonia, classify and distinguish between COVID-19, Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, and normal conditions. Furthermore, sophisticated models can be built to segment the affected area in the lungs and quantify the infection volume for a better understanding of the extent of damage. Many models have been developed either independently or with the help of pre-trained models like VGG19, ResNet50, and AlexNet leveraging the concept of transfer learning. Apart from model development, data preprocessing and augmentation are also performed to cope with the challenge of insufficient data samples often encountered in medical applications. It can be evaluated that DL and AI can be effectively implemented to withstand the challenges posed by the global emergency\n",
      "Graph neural networks have become very popular for machine learning on molecules due to the expressive power of their learnt representations. However, molecular machine learning is a classically low-data regime and it isn't clear that graph neural networks can avoid overfitting in low-resource settings. In contrast, fingerprint methods are the traditional standard for low-data environments due to their reduced number of parameters and manually engineered features. In this work, we investigate whether graph neural networks are competitive in small data settings compared to the parametrically 'cheaper' alternative of fingerprint methods. When we find that they are not, we explore pretraining and the meta-learning method MAML (and variants FO-MAML and ANIL) for improving graph neural network performance by transfer learning from related tasks. We find that MAML and FO-MAML do enable the graph neural network to outperform models based on fingerprints, providing a path to using graph neural networks even in settings with severely restricted data availability. In contrast to previous work, we find ANIL performs worse that other meta-learning approaches in this molecule setting. Our results suggest two reasons: molecular machine learning tasks may require significant task-specific adaptation, and distribution shifts in test tasks relative to train tasks may contribute to worse ANIL performance.\n",
      "We propose a new model for relational VAE semi-supervision capable of balancing disentanglement and low complexity modelling of relations with different symbolic properties. We compare the relative benefits of relation-decoder complexity and latent space structure on both inductive and transductive transfer learning. Our results depict a complex picture where enforcing structure on semi-supervised representations can greatly improve zero-shot transductive transfer, but may be less favourable or even impact negatively the capacity for inductive transfer.\n",
      "Roof falls due to geological conditions are major safety hazards in mining and tunneling industries, causing lost work times, injuries, and fatalities. Several large-opening limestone mines in the Eastern and Midwestern United States have roof fall problems caused by high horizontal stresses. The typical hazard management approach for this type of roof fall hazard relies heavily on visual inspections and expert knowledge. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) based system for the detection roof fall hazards caused by high horizontal stresses. We use images depicting hazardous and non-hazardous roof conditions to develop a convolutional neural network for autonomous detection of hazardous roof conditions. To compensate for limited input data, we utilize a transfer learning approach. In transfer learning, an already-trained network is used as a starting point for classification in a similar domain. Results confirm that this approach works well for classifying roof conditions as hazardous or safe, achieving a statistical accuracy of 86%. However, accuracy alone is not enough to ensure a reliable hazard management system. System constraints and reliability are improved when the features being used by the network are understood. Therefore, we used a deep learning interpretation technique called integrated gradients to identify the important geologic features in each image for prediction. The analysis of integrated gradients shows that the system mimics expert judgment on roof fall hazard detection. The system developed in this paper demonstrates the potential of deep learning in geological hazard management to complement human experts, and likely to become an essential part of autonomous tunneling operations in those cases where hazard identification heavily depends on expert knowledge.\n",
      "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques have proven to be very useful in image-based anomaly detection applications. CNN can be used as deep features extractor where other anomaly detection techniques are applied on these features. For this scenario, using transfer learning is common since pretrained models provide deep feature representations that are useful for anomaly detection tasks. Consequentially, anomaly can be detected by applying similarly measure between extracted features and a defined model of normality. A key factor in such approaches is the decision threshold used for detecting anomaly. While most of the proposed methods focus on the approach itself, slight attention has been paid to address decision threshold settings. In this paper, we tackle this problem and propose a welldefined method to set the working-point decision threshold that improves detection accuracy. We introduce a transfer learning framework for anomaly detection based on similarity measure with a Model of Normality (MoN) and show that with the proposed threshold settings, a significant performance improvement can be achieved. Moreover, the framework has low complexity with relaxed computational requirements.\n",
      "The performance of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) models, particularly deep neural networks, is highly contingent upon the availability of the massive amount of annotated training data which should be sufficiently labeled. Though, data acquisition and manual annotation in the HAR domain are prohibitively expensive due to skilled human resource requirements in both steps. Hence, domain adaptation techniques have been proposed to adapt the knowledge from the existing source of data. More recently, adversarial transfer learning methods have shown very promising results in image classification, yet limited for sensor-based HAR problems, which are still prone to the unfavorable effects of the imbalanced distribution of samples. This paper presents a novel generic and robust approach for semi-supervised domain adaptation in HAR, which capitalizes on the advantages of the adversarial framework to tackle the shortcomings, by leveraging knowledge from annotated samples exclusively from the source subject and unlabeled ones of the target subject. Extensive subject translation experiments are conducted on three large, middle, and small-size datasets with different levels of imbalance to assess the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model to the scale as well as imbalance in the data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art methods, which led in up to 13%, 4%, and 13% improvement of our high-level activities recognition metrics for Opportunity, LISSI, and PAMAP2 datasets, respectively. The LISSI dataset is the most challenging one owing to its less populated and imbalanced distribution. Compared to the SA-GAN adversarial domain adaptation method, the proposed approach enhances the final classification performance with an average of 7.5% for the three datasets, which emphasizes the effectiveness of micro-mini-batch training.\n",
      "Semi-supervised learning lately has shown much promise in improving deep learning models when labeled data is scarce. Common among recent approaches is the use of consistency training on a large amount of unlabeled data to constrain model predictions to be invariant to input noise. In this work, we present a new perspective on how to effectively noise unlabeled examples and argue that the quality of noising, specifically those produced by advanced data augmentation methods, plays a crucial role in semi-supervised learning. By substituting simple noising operations with advanced data augmentation methods such as RandAugment and back-translation, our method brings substantial improvements across six language and three vision tasks under the same consistency training framework. On the IMDb text classification dataset, with only 20 labeled examples, our method achieves an error rate of 4.20, outperforming the state-of-the-art model trained on 25,000 labeled examples. On a standard semi-supervised learning benchmark, CIFAR-10, our method outperforms all previous approaches and achieves an error rate of 5.43 with only 250 examples. Our method also combines well with transfer learning, e.g., when finetuning from BERT, and yields improvements in high-data regime, such as ImageNet, whether when there is only 10% labeled data or when a full labeled set with 1.3M extra unlabeled examples is used. Code is available at https://github.com/google-research/uda.\n",
      "Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) learns predictive models from task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, for distinguishing when subjects are performing different cognitive tasks -- e.g., watching movies or making decisions. MVPA works best with a well-designed feature set and an adequate sample size. However, most fMRI datasets are noisy, high-dimensional, expensive to collect, and with small sample sizes. Further, training a robust, generalized predictive model that can analyze homogeneous cognitive tasks provided by multi-site fMRI datasets has additional challenges. This paper proposes the Shared Space Transfer Learning (SSTL) as a novel transfer learning (TL) approach that can functionally align homogeneous multi-site fMRI datasets, and so improve the prediction performance in every site. SSTL first extracts a set of common features for all subjects in each site. It then uses TL to map these site-specific features to a site-independent shared space in order to improve the performance of the MVPA. SSTL uses a scalable optimization procedure that works effectively for high-dimensional fMRI datasets. The optimization procedure extracts the common features for each site by using a single-iteration algorithm and maps these site-specific common features to the site-independent shared space. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for transferring between various cognitive tasks. Our comprehensive experiments validate that SSTL achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art analysis techniques.\n",
      "With recent advances in RGB-D sensing technologies as well as improvements in machine learning and fusion techniques, RGB-D facial recognition has become an active area of research. A novel attention aware method is proposed to fuse two image modalities, RGB and depth, for enhanced RGB-D facial recognition. The proposed method first extracts features from both modalities using a convolutional feature extractor. These features are then fused using a two-layer attention mechanism. The first layer focuses on the fused feature maps generated by the feature extractor, exploiting the relationship between feature maps using LSTM recurrent learning. The second layer focuses on the spatial features of those maps using convolution. The training database is preprocessed and augmented through a set of geometric transformations, and the learning process is further aided using transfer learning from a pure 2D RGB image training process. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, including both traditional and deep neural network-based methods, on the challenging CurtinFaces and IIIT-D RGB-D benchmark databases, achieving classification accuracies over 98.2% and 99.3% respectively. The proposed attention mechanism is also compared with other attention mechanisms, demonstrating more accurate results.\n",
      "Fine-tuning deep neural networks pre-trained on large scale datasets is one of the most practical transfer learning paradigm given limited quantity of training samples. To obtain better generalization, using the starting point as the reference, either through weights or features, has been successfully applied to transfer learning as a regularizer. However, due to the domain discrepancy between the source and target tasks, there exists obvious risk of negative transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning algorithm, introducing the idea of Target-awareness REpresentation Disentanglement (TRED), where the relevant knowledge with respect to the target task is disentangled from the original source model and used as a regularizer during fine-tuning the target model. Experiments on various real world datasets show that our method stably improves the standard fine-tuning by more than 2% in average. TRED also outperforms other state-of-the-art transfer learning regularizers such as L2-SP, AT, DELTA and BSS.\n",
      "Transfer learning enhances learning across tasks, by leveraging previously learned representations -- if they are properly chosen. We describe an efficient method to accurately estimate the appropriateness of a previously trained model for use in a new learning task. We use this measure, which we call \"Predict To Learn\" (\"P2L\"), in the two very different domains of images and semantic relations, where it predicts, from a set of \"source\" models, the one model most likely to produce effective transfer for training a given \"target\" model. We validate our approach thoroughly, by assembling a collection of candidate source models, then fine-tuning each candidate to perform each of a collection of target tasks, and finally measuring how well transfer has been enhanced. Across 95 tasks within multiple domains (images classification and semantic relations), the P2L approach was able to select the best transfer learning model on average, while the heuristic of choosing model trained with the largest data set selected the best model in only 55 cases. These results suggest that P2L captures important information in common between source and target tasks, and that this shared informational structure contributes to successful transfer learning more than simple data size.\n",
      "The automatic interpretation of sign languages is a challenging task, as it requires the usage of high-level vision and high-level motion processing systems for providing accurate image perception. In this paper, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning in order to make computers able to interpret signs of the Swedish Sign Language (SSL) hand alphabet. Our model consist of the implementation of a pre-trained InceptionV3 network, and the usage of the mini-batch gradient descent optimization algorithm. We rely on transfer learning during the pre-training of the model and its data. The final accuracy of the model, based on 8 study subjects and 9,400 images, is 85%. Our results indicate that the usage of CNNs is a promising approach to interpret sign languages, and transfer learning can be used to achieve high testing accuracy despite using a small training dataset. Furthermore, we describe the implementation details of our model to interpret signs as a user-friendly web application.\n",
      "The nonlinearity of activation functions used in deep learning models are crucial for the success of predictive models. There are several commonly used simple nonlinear functions, including Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and Leaky-ReLU (L-ReLU). In practice, these functions remarkably enhance the model accuracy. However, there is limited insight into the functionality of these nonlinear activation functions in terms of why certain models perform better than others. Here, we investigate the model performance when using ReLU or L-ReLU as activation functions in different model architectures and data domains. Interestingly, we found that the application of L-ReLU is mostly effective when the number of trainable parameters in a model is relatively small. Furthermore, we found that the image classification models seem to perform well with L-ReLU in fully connected layers, especially when pre-trained models such as the VGG-16 are used for the transfer learning.\n",
      "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a retinal microvascular condition that emerges in diabetic patients. DR will continue to be a leading cause of blindness worldwide, with a predicted 191.0 million globally diagnosed patients in 2030. Microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, and cotton wool spots are common signs of DR. However, they can be small and hard for human eyes to detect. Early detection of DR is crucial for effective clinical treatment. Existing methods to classify images require much time for feature extraction and selection, and are limited in their performance. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), as an emerging deep learning (DL) method, have proven their potential in image classification tasks. In this paper, comprehensive experimental studies of implementing state-of-the-art CNNs for the detection and classification of DR are conducted in order to determine the top performing classifiers for the task. Five CNN classifiers, namely Inception-V3, VGG19, VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2, are evaluated through experiments. They categorize medical images into five different classes based on DR severity. Data augmentation and transfer learning techniques are applied since annotated medical images are limited and imbalanced. Experimental results indicate that the ResNet50 classifier has top performance for binary classification and that the InceptionResNetV2 classifier has top performance for multi-class DR classification.\n",
      "Time series analysis is a field of data science which is interested in analyzing sequences of numerical values ordered in time. Time series are particularly interesting because they allow us to visualize and understand the evolution of a process over time. Their analysis can reveal trends, relationships and similarities across the data. There exists numerous fields containing data in the form of time series: health care (electrocardiogram, blood sugar, etc.), activity recognition, remote sensing, finance (stock market price), industry (sensors), etc. Time series classification consists of constructing algorithms dedicated to automatically label time series data. The sequential aspect of time series data requires the development of algorithms that are able to harness this temporal property, thus making the existing off-the-shelf machine learning models for traditional tabular data suboptimal for solving the underlying task. In this context, deep learning has emerged in recent years as one of the most effective methods for tackling the supervised classification task, particularly in the field of computer vision. The main objective of this thesis was to study and develop deep neural networks specifically constructed for the classification of time series data. We thus carried out the first large scale experimental study allowing us to compare the existing deep methods and to position them compared other non-deep learning based state-of-the-art methods. Subsequently, we made numerous contributions in this area, notably in the context of transfer learning, data augmentation, ensembling and adversarial attacks. Finally, we have also proposed a novel architecture, based on the famous Inception network (Google), which ranks among the most efficient to date.\n",
      "People deploy top-down, goal-directed attention to accomplish tasks, such as finding lost keys. By tuning the visual system to relevant information sources, object recognition can become more efficient (a benefit) and more biased toward the target (a potential cost). Motivated by selective attention in categorisation models, we developed a goal-directed attention mechanism that can process naturalistic (photographic) stimuli. Our attention mechanism can be incorporated into any existing deep convolutional neural network (DCNNs). The processing stages in DCNNs have been related to ventral visual stream. In that light, our attentional mechanism incorporates top-down influences from prefrontal cortex (PFC) to support goal-directed behaviour. Akin to how attention weights in categorisation models warp representational spaces, we introduce a layer of attention weights to the mid-level of a DCNN that amplify or attenuate activity to further a goal. We evaluated the attentional mechanism using photographic stimuli, varying the attentional target. We found that increasing goal-directed attention has benefits (increasing hit rates) and costs (increasing false alarm rates). At a moderate level, attention improves sensitivity (i.e., increases $d^\\prime$) at only a moderate increase in bias for tasks involving standard images, blended images, and natural adversarial images chosen to fool DCNNs. These results suggest that goal-directed attention can reconfigure general-purpose DCNNs to better suit the current task goal, much like PFC modulates activity along the ventral stream. In addition to being more parsimonious and brain consistent, the mid-level attention approach performed better than a standard machine learning approach for transfer learning, namely retraining the final network layer to accommodate the new task.\n",
      "While deep learning has shown promise in improving the automated diagnosis of disease based on chest X-rays, deep networks may exhibit undesirable behavior related to shortcuts. This paper studies the case of spurious class skew in which patients with a particular attribute are spuriously more likely to have the outcome of interest. For instance, clinical protocols might lead to a dataset in which patients with pacemakers are disproportionately likely to have congestive heart failure. This skew can lead to models that take shortcuts by heavily relying on the biased attribute. We explore this problem across a number of attributes in the context of diagnosing the cause of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Applied to chest X-rays, we show that i) deep nets can accurately identify many patient attributes including sex (AUROC = 0.96) and age (AUROC >= 0.90), ii) they tend to exploit correlations between such attributes and the outcome label when learning to predict a diagnosis, leading to poor performance when such correlations do not hold in the test population (e.g., everyone in the test set is male), and iii) a simple transfer learning approach is surprisingly effective at preventing the shortcut and promoting good generalization performance. On the task of diagnosing congestive heart failure based on a set of chest X-rays skewed towards older patients (age >= 63), the proposed approach improves generalization over standard training from 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54-0.77) to 0.84 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92) AUROC. While simple, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of models across populations by encouraging reliance on clinically relevant manifestations of disease, i.e., those that a clinician would use to make a diagnosis.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular paradigm for addressing sequential decision tasks in which the agent has only limited environmental feedback. Despite many advances over the past three decades, learning in many domains still requires a large amount of interaction with the environment, which can be prohibitively expensive in realistic scenarios. To address this problem, transfer learning has been applied to reinforcement learning such that experience gained in one task can be leveraged when starting to learn the next, harder task. More recently, several lines of research have explored how tasks, or data samples themselves, can be sequenced into a curriculum for the purpose of learning a problem that may otherwise be too difficult to learn from scratch. In this article, we present a framework for curriculum learning (CL) in reinforcement learning, and use it to survey and classify existing CL methods in terms of their assumptions, capabilities, and goals. Finally, we use our framework to find open problems and suggest directions for future RL curriculum learning research.\n",
      "Trauma mortality results from a multitude of non-linear dependent risk factors including patient demographics, injury characteristics, medical care provided, and characteristics of medical facilities; yet traditional approach attempted to capture these relationships using rigid regression models. We hypothesized that a transfer learning based machine learning algorithm could deeply understand a trauma patient's condition and accurately identify individuals at high risk for mortality without relying on restrictive regression model criteria. Anonymous patient visit data were obtained from years 2007-2014 of the National Trauma Data Bank. Patients with incomplete vitals, unknown outcome, or missing demographics data were excluded. All patient visits occurred in U.S. hospitals, and of the 2,007,485 encounters that were retrospectively examined, 8,198 resulted in mortality (0.4%). The machine intelligence model was evaluated on its sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Our model achieved similar performance in age-specific comparison models and generalized well when applied to all ages simultaneously. While testing for confounding factors, we discovered that excluding fall-related injuries boosted performance for adult trauma patients; however, it reduced performance for children. The machine intelligence model described here demonstrates similar performance to contemporary machine intelligence models without requiring restrictive regression model criteria or extensive medical expertise.\n",
      "Learning long-range behaviors on complex high-dimensional agents is a fundamental problem in robot learning. For such tasks, we argue that transferring learned information from a morphologically simpler agent can massively improve the sample efficiency of a more complex one. To this end, we propose a hierarchical decoupling of policies into two parts: an independently learned low-level policy and a transferable high-level policy. To remedy poor transfer performance due to mismatch in morphologies, we contribute two key ideas. First, we show that incentivizing a complex agent's low-level to imitate a simpler agent's low-level significantly improves zero-shot high-level transfer. Second, we show that KL-regularized training of the high level stabilizes learning and prevents mode-collapse. Finally, on a suite of publicly released navigation and manipulation environments, we demonstrate the applicability of hierarchical transfer on long-range tasks across morphologies. Our code and videos can be found at https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/morphology-transfer.\n",
      "In this paper, we introduce a novel form of value function, $Q(s, s')$, that expresses the utility of transitioning from a state $s$ to a neighboring state $s'$ and then acting optimally thereafter. In order to derive an optimal policy, we develop a forward dynamics model that learns to make next-state predictions that maximize this value. This formulation decouples actions from values while still learning off-policy. We highlight the benefits of this approach in terms of value function transfer, learning within redundant action spaces, and learning off-policy from state observations generated by sub-optimal or completely random policies. Code and videos are available at http://sites.google.com/view/qss-paper.\n",
      "Forecasting models that are trained across sets of many time series, known as Global Forecasting Models (GFM), have shown recently promising results in forecasting competitions and real-world applications, outperforming many state-of-the-art univariate forecasting techniques. In most cases, GFMs are implemented using deep neural networks, and in particular Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which require a sufficient amount of time series to estimate their numerous model parameters. However, many time series databases have only a limited number of time series. In this study, we propose a novel, data augmentation based forecasting framework that is capable of improving the baseline accuracy of the GFM models in less data-abundant settings. We use three time series augmentation techniques: GRATIS, moving block bootstrap (MBB), and dynamic time warping barycentric averaging (DBA) to synthetically generate a collection of time series. The knowledge acquired from these augmented time series is then transferred to the original dataset using two different approaches: the pooled approach and the transfer learning approach. When building GFMs, in the pooled approach, we train a model on the augmented time series alongside the original time series dataset, whereas in the transfer learning approach, we adapt a pre-trained model to the new dataset. In our evaluation on competition and real-world time series datasets, our proposed variants can significantly improve the baseline accuracy of GFM models and outperform state-of-the-art univariate forecasting methods.\n",
      "Human beings learn causal models and constantly use them to transfer knowledge between similar environments. We use this intuition to design a transfer-learning framework using object-oriented representations to learn the causal relationships between objects. A learned causal dynamics model can be used to transfer between variants of an environment with exchangeable perceptual features among objects but with the same underlying causal dynamics. We adapt continuous optimization for structure learning techniques to explicitly learn the cause and effects of the actions in an interactive environment and transfer to the target domain by categorization of the objects based on causal knowledge. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in a gridworld setting by combining causal model-based approach with model-free approach in reinforcement learning.\n",
      "Due to the characteristics of COVID-19, the epidemic develops rapidly and overwhelms health service systems worldwide. Many patients suffer from systemic life-threatening problems and need to be carefully monitored in ICUs. Thus the intelligent prognosis is in an urgent need to assist physicians to take an early intervention, prevent the adverse outcome, and optimize the medical resource allocation. However, in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, the data available for analysis is limited due to the lack of effective diagnostic mechanisms, rarity of the cases, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based approach, CovidCare, which leverages the existing electronic medical records to enhance the prognosis for inpatients with emerging infectious diseases. It learns to embed the COVID-19-related medical features based on massive existing EMR data via transfer learning. The transferred parameters are further trained to imitate the teacher model's representation behavior based on knowledge distillation, which embeds the health status more comprehensively in the source dataset. We conduct the length of stay prediction experiments for patients on a real-world COVID-19 dataset. The experiment results indicate that our proposed model consistently outperforms the comparative baseline methods. CovidCare also reveals that, 1) hs-cTnI, hs-CRP and Platelet Counts are the most fatal biomarkers, whose abnormal values usually indicate emergency adverse outcome. 2) Normal values of gamma-GT, AP and eGFR indicate the overall improvement of health. The medical findings extracted by CovidCare are empirically confirmed by human experts and medical literatures.\n",
      "We propose a novel adaptive transfer learning framework, learning to transfer learn (L2TL), to improve performance on a target dataset by careful extraction of the related information from a source dataset. Our framework considers cooperative optimization of shared weights between models for source and target tasks, and adjusts the constituent loss weights adaptively. The adaptation of the weights is based on a reinforcement learning (RL) selection policy, guided with a performance metric on the target validation set. We demonstrate that L2TL outperforms fine-tuning baselines and other adaptive transfer learning methods on eight datasets. In the regimes of small-scale target datasets and significant label mismatch between source and target datasets, L2TL shows particularly large benefits.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically start tabula rasa, without any prior knowledge of the environment, and without any prior skills. This however often leads to low sample efficiency, requiring a large amount of interaction with the environment. This is especially true in a lifelong learning setting, in which the agent needs to continually extend its capabilities. In this paper, we examine how a pre-trained task-independent language model can make a goal-conditional RL agent more sample efficient. We do this by facilitating transfer learning between different related tasks. We experimentally demonstrate our approach on a set of object navigation tasks.\n",
      "This work is devoted to unresolved problems of Artificial General Intelligence - the inefficiency of transfer learning. One of the mechanisms that are used to solve this problem in the area of reinforcement learning is a model-based approach. In the paper we are expanding the schema networks method which allows to extract the logical relationships between objects and actions from the environment data. We present algorithms for training a Delta Schema Network (DSN), predicting future states of the environment and planning actions that will lead to positive reward. DSN shows strong performance of transfer learning on the classic Atari game environment.\n",
      "Transfer learning involves taking information and insight from one problem domain and applying it to a new problem domain. Although widely used in practice, theory for transfer learning remains less well-developed. To address this, we prove several novel results related to transfer learning, showing the need to carefully select which sets of information to transfer and the need for dependence between transferred information and target problems. Furthermore, we prove how the degree of probabilistic change in an algorithm using transfer learning places an upper bound on the amount of improvement possible. These results build on the algorithmic search framework for machine learning, allowing the results to apply to a wide range of learning problems using transfer.\n",

      "In this paper, we propose enhancing actor-critic reinforcement learning agents by parameterising the final actor layer which produces the actions in order to accommodate the behaviour discrepancy of different actuators, under different load conditions during interaction with the environment. We propose branching the action producing layer in the actor to learn the tuning parameter controlling the activation layer (e.g. Tanh and Sigmoid). The learned parameters are then used to create tailored activation functions for each actuator. We ran experiments on three OpenAI Gym environments, i.e. Pendulum-v0, LunarLanderContinuous-v2 and BipedalWalker-v2. Results have shown an average of 23.15% and 33.80% increase in total episode reward of the LunarLanderContinuous-v2 and BipedalWalker-v2 environments, respectively. There was no significant improvement in Pendulum-v0 environment but the proposed method produces a more stable actuation signal compared to the state-of-the-art method. The proposed method allows the reinforcement learning actor to produce more robust actions that accommodate the discrepancy in the actuators' response functions. This is particularly useful for real life scenarios where actuators exhibit different response functions depending on the load and the interaction with the environment. This also simplifies the transfer learning problem by fine tuning the parameterised activation layers instead of retraining the entire policy every time an actuator is replaced. Finally, the proposed method would allow better accommodation to biological actuators (e.g. muscles) in biomechanical systems.\n",
      "Transfer Learning (TL) has shown great potential to accelerate Reinforcement Learning (RL) by leveraging prior knowledge from past learned policies of relevant tasks. Existing transfer approaches either explicitly computes the similarity between tasks or select appropriate source policies to provide guided explorations for the target task. However, how to directly optimize the target policy by alternatively utilizing knowledge from appropriate source policies without explicitly measuring the similarity is currently missing. In this paper, we propose a novel Policy Transfer Framework (PTF) to accelerate RL by taking advantage of this idea. Our framework learns when and which source policy is the best to reuse for the target policy and when to terminate it by modeling multi-policy transfer as the option learning problem. PTF can be easily combined with existing deep RL approaches. Experimental results show it significantly accelerates the learning process and surpasses state-of-the-art policy transfer methods in terms of learning efficiency and final performance in both discrete and continuous action spaces.\n",
      "With widespread applications of artificial intelligence (AI), the capabilities of the perception, understanding, decision-making and control for autonomous systems have improved significantly in the past years. When autonomous systems consider the performance of accuracy and transferability, several AI methods, like adversarial learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and meta-learning, show their powerful performance. Here, we review the learning-based approaches in autonomous systems from the perspectives of accuracy and transferability. Accuracy means that a well-trained model shows good results during the testing phase, in which the testing set shares a same task or a data distribution with the training set. Transferability means that when a well-trained model is transferred to other testing domains, the accuracy is still good. Firstly, we introduce some basic concepts of transfer learning and then present some preliminaries of adversarial learning, RL and meta-learning. Secondly, we focus on reviewing the accuracy or transferability or both of them to show the advantages of adversarial learning, like generative adversarial networks (GANs), in typical computer vision tasks in autonomous systems, including image style transfer, image superresolution, image deblurring/dehazing/rain removal, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, pedestrian detection and person re-identification (re-ID). Then, we further review the performance of RL and meta-learning from the aspects of accuracy or transferability or both of them in autonomous systems, involving pedestrian tracking, robot navigation and robotic manipulation. Finally, we discuss several challenges and future topics for using adversarial learning, RL and meta-learning in autonomous systems.\n",
      "We show how Markov mixed membership models (MMMM) can be used to predict the degradation of assets. We model the degradation path of individual assets, to predict overall failure rates. Instead of a separate distribution for each hidden state, we use hierarchical mixtures of distributions in the exponential family. In our approach the observation distribution of the states is a finite mixture distribution of a small set of (simpler) distributions shared across all states. Using tied-mixture observation distributions offers several advantages. The mixtures act as a regularization for typically very sparse problems, and they reduce the computational effort for the learning algorithm since there are fewer distributions to be found. Using shared mixtures enables sharing of statistical strength between the Markov states and thus transfer learning. We determine for individual assets the trade-off between the risk of failure and extended operating hours by combining a MMMM with a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to dynamically optimize the policy for when and how to maintain the asset.\n",
      "This work aims at unveiling the potential of Transfer Learning (TL) for developing a traffic flow forecasting model in scenarios of absent data. Knowledge transfer from high-quality predictive models becomes feasible under the TL paradigm, enabling the generation of new proper models with few data. In order to explore this capability, we identify three different levels of data absent scenarios, where TL techniques are applied among Deep Learning (DL) methods for traffic forecasting. Then, traditional batch learning is compared against TL based models using real traffic flow data, collected by deployed loops managed by the City Council of Madrid (Spain). In addition, we apply Online Learning (OL) techniques, where model receives an update after each prediction, in order to adapt to traffic flow trend changes and incrementally learn from new incoming traffic data. The obtained experimental results shed light on the advantages of transfer and online learning for traffic flow forecasting, and draw practical insights on their interplay with the amount of available training data at the location of interest.\n",
      "Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) is a class of algorithms in Reinforcement learning (RL), which tries to imitate an expert without taking any reward from the environment and does not provide expert behavior directly to the policy training. Rather, an agent learns a policy distribution that minimizes the difference from expert behavior in an adversarial setting. Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) leverages the idea of AIL, integrates a reward function approximation along with learning the policy, and shows the utility of IRL in the transfer learning setting. But the reward function approximator that enables transfer learning does not perform well in imitation tasks. We propose an Off-Policy Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Off-policy-AIRL) algorithm which is sample efficient as well as gives good imitation performance compared to the state-of-the-art AIL algorithm in the continuous control tasks. For the same reward function approximator, we show the utility of learning our algorithm over AIL by using the learned reward function to retrain the policy over a task under significant variation where expert demonstrations are absent.\n",
      "Existing image-based activity understanding methods mainly adopt direct mapping, i.e. from image to activity concepts, which may encounter performance bottleneck since the huge gap. In light of this, we propose a new path: infer human part states first and then reason out the activities based on part-level semantics. Human Body Part States (PaSta) are fine-grained action semantic tokens, e.g. <hand, hold, something>, which can compose the activities and help us step toward human activity knowledge engine. To fully utilize the power of PaSta, we build a large-scale knowledge base PaStaNet, which contains 7M+ PaSta annotations. And two corresponding models are proposed: first, we design a model named Activity2Vec to extract PaSta features, which aim to be general representations for various activities. Second, we use a PaSta-based Reasoning method to infer activities. Promoted by PaStaNet, our method achieves significant improvements, e.g. 6.4 and 13.9 mAP on full and one-shot sets of HICO in supervised learning, and 3.2 and 4.2 mAP on V-COCO and images-based AVA in transfer learning. Code and data are available at http://hake-mvig.cn/.\n",
      "A common challenge in reinforcement learning is how to convert the agent's interactions with an environment into fast and robust learning. For instance, earlier work makes use of domain knowledge to improve existing reinforcement learning algorithms in complex tasks. While promising, previously acquired knowledge is often costly and challenging to scale up. Instead, we decide to consider problem knowledge with signals from quantities relevant to solve any task, e.g., self-performance assessment and accurate expectations. $\\mathcal{V}^{ex}$ is such a quantity. It is the fraction of variance explained by the value function $V$ and measures the discrepancy between $V$ and the returns. Taking advantage of $\\mathcal{V}^{ex}$, we propose MERL, a general framework for structuring reinforcement learning by injecting problem knowledge into policy gradient updates. As a result, the agent is not only optimized for a reward but learns using problem-focused quantities provided by MERL, applicable out-of-the-box to any task. In this paper: (a) We introduce and define MERL, the multi-head reinforcement learning framework we use throughout this work. (b) We conduct experiments across a variety of standard benchmark environments, including 9 continuous control tasks, where results show improved performance. (c) We demonstrate that MERL also improves transfer learning on a set of challenging pixel-based tasks. (d) We ponder how MERL tackles the problem of reward sparsity and better conditions the feature space of reinforcement learning agents.\n",
      "Deep reinforcement learning has proven to be successful for learning tasks in simulated environments, but applying same techniques for robots in real-world domain is more challenging, as they require hours of training. To address this, transfer learning can be used to train the policy first in a simulated environment and then transfer it to physical agent. As the simulation never matches reality perfectly, the physics, visuals and action spaces by necessity differ between these environments to some degree. In this work, we study how general video games can be directly used instead of fine-tuned simulations for the sim-to-real transfer. Especially, we study how the agent can learn the new action space autonomously, when the game actions do not match the robot actions. Our results show that the different action space can be learned by re-training only part of neural network and we obtain above 90% mean success rate in simulation and robot experiments.\n",
      "In recent years, Multifactorial Optimization (MFO) has gained a notable momentum in the research community. MFO is known for its inherent capability to efficiently address multiple optimization tasks at the same time, while transferring information among such tasks to improve their convergence speed. On the other hand, the quantum leap made by Deep Q Learning (DQL) in the Machine Learning field has allowed facing Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems of unprecedented complexity. Unfortunately, complex DQL models usually find it difficult to converge to optimal policies due to the lack of exploration or sparse rewards. In order to overcome these drawbacks, pre-trained models are widely harnessed via Transfer Learning, extrapolating knowledge acquired in a source task to the target task. Besides, meta-heuristic optimization has been shown to reduce the lack of exploration of DQL models. This work proposes a MFO framework capable of simultaneously evolving several DQL models towards solving interrelated RL tasks. Specifically, our proposed framework blends together the benefits of meta-heuristic optimization, Transfer Learning and DQL to automate the process of knowledge transfer and policy learning of distributed RL agents. A thorough experimentation is presented and discussed so as to assess the performance of the framework, its comparison to the traditional methodology for Transfer Learning in terms of convergence, speed and policy quality , and the intertask relationships found and exploited over the search process.\n",
      "As the performance of computer systems stagnates due to the end of Moore's Law, there is a need for new models that can understand and optimize the execution of general purpose code. While there is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of source code, these representations do not understand how code dynamically executes. In this work, we propose a new approach to use GNNs to learn fused representations of general source code and its execution. Our approach defines a multi-task GNN over low-level representations of source code and program state (i.e., assembly code and dynamic memory states), converting complex source code constructs and complex data structures into a simpler, more uniform format. We show that this leads to improved performance over similar methods that do not use execution and it opens the door to applying GNN models to new tasks that would not be feasible from static code alone. As an illustration of this, we apply the new model to challenging dynamic tasks (branch prediction and prefetching) from the SPEC CPU benchmark suite, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 26% and 45% respectively. Moreover, we use the learned fused graph embeddings to demonstrate transfer learning with high performance on an indirectly related task (algorithm classification).\n",
      "Parameter-transfer is a well-known and versatile approach for meta-learning, with applications including few-shot learning, federated learning, and reinforcement learning. However, parameter-transfer algorithms often require sharing models that have been trained on the samples from specific tasks, thus leaving the task-owners susceptible to breaches of privacy. We conduct the first formal study of privacy in this setting and formalize the notion of task-global differential privacy as a practical relaxation of more commonly studied threat models. We then propose a new differentially private algorithm for gradient-based parameter transfer that not only satisfies this privacy requirement but also retains provable transfer learning guarantees in convex settings. Empirically, we apply our analysis to the problems of federated learning with personalization and few-shot classification, showing that allowing the relaxation to task-global privacy from the more commonly studied notion of local privacy leads to dramatically increased performance in recurrent neural language modeling and image classification.\n",
      "The counterfeit goods trade represents nowadays more than 3.3% of the whole world trade and thus it's a problem that needs now more than ever a lot of attention and a reliable solution that would reduce the negative impact it has over the modern society. This paper presents the design and early stage development of a novel counterfeit goods detection platform that makes use of the outstsanding learning capabilities of the classical VGG16 convolutional model trained through the process of \"transfer learning\" and a multi-stage fake detection procedure that proved to be not only reliable but also very robust in the experiments we have conducted so far using an image dataset of various goods which we gathered ourselves.\n",
      "Transfer learning has become the de facto standard in computer vision and natural language processing, especially where labeled data is scarce. Accuracy can be significantly improved by using pre-trained models and subsequent fine-tuning. In visual reasoning tasks, such as image question answering, transfer learning is more complex. In addition to transferring the capability to recognize visual features, we also expect to transfer the system's ability to reason. Moreover, for video data, temporal reasoning adds another dimension. In this work, we formalize these unique aspects of transfer learning and propose a theoretical framework for visual reasoning, exemplified by the well-established CLEVR and COG datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a new, end-to-end differentiable recurrent model (SAMNet), which shows state-of-the-art accuracy and better performance in transfer learning on both datasets. The improved performance of SAMNet stems from its capability to decouple the abstract multi-step reasoning from the length of the sequence and its selective attention enabling to store only the question-relevant objects in the external memory.\n",
      "Quantum hardware and quantum-inspired algorithms are becoming increasingly popular for combinatorial optimization. However, these algorithms may require careful hyperparameter tuning for each problem instance. We use a reinforcement learning agent in conjunction with a quantum-inspired algorithm to solve the Ising energy minimization problem, which is equivalent to the Maximum Cut problem. The agent controls the algorithm by tuning one of its parameters with the goal of improving recently seen solutions. We propose a new Rescaled Ranked Reward (R3) method that enables stable single-player version of self-play training that helps the agent to escape local optima. The training on any problem instance can be accelerated by applying transfer learning from an agent trained on randomly generated problems. Our approach allows sampling high-quality solutions to the Ising problem with high probability and outperforms both baseline heuristics and a black-box hyperparameter optimization approach.\n",
      "Transferring knowledge across tasks to improve data-efficiency is one of the open key challenges in the field of global black-box optimization. Readily available algorithms are typically designed to be universal optimizers and, therefore, often suboptimal for specific tasks. We propose a novel transfer learning method to obtain customized optimizers within the well-established framework of Bayesian optimization, allowing our algorithm to utilize the proven generalization capabilities of Gaussian processes. Using reinforcement learning to meta-train an acquisition function (AF) on a set of related tasks, the proposed method learns to extract implicit structural information and to exploit it for improved data-efficiency. We present experiments on a simulation-to-real transfer task as well as on several synthetic functions and on two hyperparameter search problems. The results show that our algorithm (1) automatically identifies structural properties of objective functions from available source tasks or simulations, (2) performs favourably in settings with both scarse and abundant source data, and (3) falls back to the performance level of general AFs if no particular structure is present.\n",
      "Artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting when they are sequentially trained on multiple tasks. To overcome this problem, we present a novel approach based on task-conditioned hypernetworks, i.e., networks that generate the weights of a target model based on task identity. Continual learning (CL) is less difficult for this class of models thanks to a simple key feature: instead of recalling the input-output relations of all previously seen data, task-conditioned hypernetworks only require rehearsing task-specific weight realizations, which can be maintained in memory using a simple regularizer. Besides achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard CL benchmarks, additional experiments on long task sequences reveal that task-conditioned hypernetworks display a very large capacity to retain previous memories. Notably, such long memory lifetimes are achieved in a compressive regime, when the number of trainable hypernetwork weights is comparable or smaller than target network size. We provide insight into the structure of low-dimensional task embedding spaces (the input space of the hypernetwork) and show that task-conditioned hypernetworks demonstrate transfer learning. Finally, forward information transfer is further supported by empirical results on a challenging CL benchmark based on the CIFAR-10/100 image datasets.\n",
      "In deep reinforcement learning, building policies of high-quality is challenging when the feature space of states is small and the training data is limited. Despite the success of previous transfer learning approaches in deep reinforcement learning, directly transferring data or models from an agent to another agent is often not allowed due to the privacy of data and/or models in many privacy-aware applications. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to federatively build models of high-quality for agents with consideration of their privacies, namely Federated deep Reinforcement Learning (FedRL). To protect the privacy of data and models, we exploit Gausian differentials on the information shared with each other when updating their local models. In the experiment, we evaluate our FedRL framework in two diverse domains, Grid-world and Text2Action domains, by comparing to various baselines.\n",
      "The recent success of deep neural networks (DNNs) for function approximation in reinforcement learning has triggered the development of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms in various fields, such as robotics, computer games, natural language processing, computer vision, sensing systems, and wireless networking. Unfortunately, DNNs suffer from high computational cost and memory consumption, which limits the use of DRL algorithms in systems with limited hardware resources. In recent years, pruning algorithms have demonstrated considerable success in reducing the redundancy of DNNs in classification tasks. However, existing algorithms suffer from a significant performance reduction in the DRL domain. In this paper, we develop the first effective solution to the performance reduction problem of pruning in the DRL domain, and establish a working algorithm, named Policy Pruning and Shrinking (PoPS), to train DRL models with strong performance while achieving a compact representation of the DNN. The framework is based on a novel iterative policy pruning and shrinking method that leverages the power of transfer learning when training the DRL model. We present an extensive experimental study that demonstrates the strong performance of PoPS using the popular Cartpole, Lunar Lander, Pong, and Pacman environments. Finally, we develop an open source software for the benefit of researchers and developers in related fields.\n",
      "Previous studies have used a specific success metric within an algorithmic search framework to prove machine learning impossibility results. However, this specific success metric prevents us from applying these results on other forms of machine learning, e.g. transfer learning. We define decomposable metrics as a category of success metrics for search problems which can be expressed as a linear operation on a probability distribution to solve this issue. Using an arbitrary decomposable metric to measure the success of a search, we demonstrate theorems which bound success in various ways, generalizing several existing results in the literature.\n",
      "We propose SWA-Gaussian (SWAG), a simple, scalable, and general purpose approach for uncertainty representation and calibration in deep learning. Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA), which computes the first moment of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) iterates with a modified learning rate schedule, has recently been shown to improve generalization in deep learning. With SWAG, we fit a Gaussian using the SWA solution as the first moment and a low rank plus diagonal covariance also derived from the SGD iterates, forming an approximate posterior distribution over neural network weights; we then sample from this Gaussian distribution to perform Bayesian model averaging. We empirically find that SWAG approximates the shape of the true posterior, in accordance with results describing the stationary distribution of SGD iterates. Moreover, we demonstrate that SWAG performs well on a wide variety of tasks, including out of sample detection, calibration, and transfer learning, in comparison to many popular alternatives including MC dropout, KFAC Laplace, SGLD, and temperature scaling.\n",
      "The composition of elementary behaviors to solve challenging transfer learning problems is one of the key elements in building intelligent machines. To date, there has been plenty of work on learning task-specific policies or skills but almost no focus on composing necessary, task-agnostic skills to find a solution to new problems. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based skill transfer and composition method that takes the agent's primitive policies to solve unseen tasks. We evaluate our method in difficult cases where training policy through standard reinforcement learning (RL) or even hierarchical RL is either not feasible or exhibits high sample complexity. We show that our method not only transfers skills to new problem settings but also solves the challenging environments requiring both task planning and motion control with high data efficiency.\n",
      "Visual knowledge bases such as Visual Genome power numerous applications in computer vision, including visual question answering and captioning, but suffer from sparse, incomplete relationships. All scene graph models to date are limited to training on a small set of visual relationships that have thousands of training labels each. Hiring human annotators is expensive, and using textual knowledge base completion methods are incompatible with visual data. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised method that assigns probabilistic relationship labels to a large number of unlabeled images using few labeled examples. We analyze visual relationships to suggest two types of image-agnostic features that are used to generate noisy heuristics, whose outputs are aggregated using a factor graph-based generative model. With as few as 10 labeled examples per relationship, the generative model creates enough training data to train any existing state-of-the-art scene graph model. We demonstrate that our method outperforms all baseline approaches on scene graph prediction by 5.16 recall@100 for PREDCLS. In our limited label setting, we define a complexity metric for relationships that serves as an indicator (R^2 = 0.778) for conditions under which our method succeeds over transfer learning, the de-facto approach for training with limited labels.\n",
      "In this work we present ISA, a novel approach for learning and exploiting subgoals in reinforcement learning (RL). Our method relies on inducing an automaton whose transitions are subgoals expressed as propositional formulas over a set of observable events. A state-of-the-art inductive logic programming system is used to learn the automaton from observation traces perceived by the RL agent. The reinforcement learning and automaton learning processes are interleaved: a new refined automaton is learned whenever the RL agent generates a trace not recognized by the current automaton. We evaluate ISA in several gridworld problems and show that it performs similarly to a method for which automata are given in advance. We also show that the learned automata can be exploited to speed up convergence through reward shaping and transfer learning across multiple tasks. Finally, we analyze the running time and the number of traces that ISA needs to learn an automata, and the impact that the number of observable events has on the learner's performance.\n",
      "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning have recently been used for 6 degrees of freedom (6-DoF) camera pose estimation. While they do not reach the same accuracy as visual SLAM-based approaches and are restricted to a specific environment, they excel in robustness and can be applied even to a single image. In this paper, we study PoseNet [1] and investigate modifications based on datasets' characteristics to improve the accuracy of the pose estimates. In particular, we emphasize the importance of field-of-view over image resolution; we present a data augmentation scheme to reduce overfitting; we study the effect of Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) cells. Lastly, we combine these modifications and improve PoseNet's performance for monocular CNN based camera pose regression.\n",
      "Value iteration networks (VINs) have been demonstrated to have a good generalization ability for reinforcement learning tasks across similar domains. However, based on our experiments, a policy learned by VINs still fail to generalize well on the domain whose action space and feature space are not identical to those in the domain where it is trained. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach on top of VINs, termed Transfer VINs (TVINs), such that a learned policy from a source domain can be generalized to a target domain with only limited training data, even if the source domain and the target domain have domain-specific actions and features. We empirically verify that our proposed TVINs outperform VINs when the source and the target domains have similar but not identical action and feature spaces. Furthermore, we show that the performance improvement is consistent across different environments, maze sizes, dataset sizes as well as different values of hyperparameters such as number of iteration and kernel size.\n",
      "Learning transferable knowledge across similar but different settings is a fundamental component of generalized intelligence. In this paper, we approach the transfer learning challenge from a causal theory perspective. Our agent is endowed with two basic yet general theories for transfer learning: (i) a task shares a common abstract structure that is invariant across domains, and (ii) the behavior of specific features of the environment remain constant across domains. We adopt a Bayesian perspective of causal theory induction and use these theories to transfer knowledge between environments. Given these general theories, the goal is to train an agent by interactively exploring the problem space to (i) discover, form, and transfer useful abstract and structural knowledge, and (ii) induce useful knowledge from the instance-level attributes observed in the environment. A hierarchy of Bayesian structures is used to model abstract-level structural causal knowledge, and an instance-level associative learning scheme learns which specific objects can be used to induce state changes through interaction. This model-learning scheme is then integrated with a model-based planner to achieve a task in the OpenLock environment, a virtual ``escape room'' with a complex hierarchy that requires agents to reason about an abstract, generalized causal structure. We compare performances against a set of predominate model-free reinforcement learning(RL) algorithms. RL agents showed poor ability transferring learned knowledge across different trials. Whereas the proposed model revealed similar performance trends as human learners, and more importantly, demonstrated transfer behavior across trials and learning situations.\n",
      "The ability to infer the intentions of others, predict their goals, and deduce their plans are critical features for intelligent agents. For a long time, several approaches investigated the use of symbolic representations and inferences with limited success, principally because it is difficult to capture the cognitive knowledge behind human decisions explicitly. The trend, nowadays, is increasingly focusing on learning to infer intentions directly from data, using deep learning in particular. We are now observing interesting applications of intent classification in natural language processing, visual activity recognition, and emerging approaches in other domains. This paper discusses a novel approach combining few-shot and transfer learning with cross-domain features, to learn to infer the intent of an agent navigating in physical environments, executing arbitrary long sequences of actions to achieve their goals. Experiments in synthetic environments demonstrate improved performance in terms of learning from few samples and generalizing to unseen configurations, compared to a deep-learning baseline approach.\n",
      "In many settings, as for example wind farms, multiple machines are instantiated to perform the same task, which is called a fleet. The recent advances with respect to the Internet of Things allow control devices and/or machines to connect through cloud-based architectures in order to share information about their status and environment. Such an infrastructure allows seamless data sharing between fleet members, which could greatly improve the sample-efficiency of reinforcement learning techniques. However in practice, these machines, while almost identical in design, have small discrepancies due to production errors or degradation, preventing control algorithms to simply aggregate and employ all fleet data. We propose a novel reinforcement learning method that learns to transfer knowledge between similar fleet members and creates member-specific dynamics models for control. Our algorithm uses Gaussian processes to establish cross-member covariances. This is significantly different from standard transfer learning methods, as the focus is not on sharing information over tasks, but rather over system specifications. We demonstrate our approach on two benchmarks and a realistic wind farm setting. Our method significantly outperforms two baseline approaches, namely individual learning and joint learning where all samples are aggregated, in terms of the median and variance of the results.\n",
      "The ability to transfer knowledge to novel environments and tasks is a sensible desiderata for general learning agents. Despite the apparent promises, transfer in RL is still an open and little exploited research area. In this paper, we take a brand-new perspective about transfer: we suggest that the ability to assign credit unveils structural invariants in the tasks that can be transferred to make RL more sample-efficient. Our main contribution is SECRET, a novel approach to transfer learning for RL that uses a backward-view credit assignment mechanism based on a self-attentive architecture. Two aspects are key to its generality: it learns to assign credit as a separate offline supervised process and exclusively modifies the reward function. Consequently, it can be supplemented by transfer methods that do not modify the reward function and it can be plugged on top of any RL algorithm.\n",
      "In this paper we target the problem of transferring policies across multiple environments with different dynamics parameters and motor noise variations, by introducing a framework that decouples the processes of policy learning and system identification. Efficiently transferring learned policies to an unknown environment with changes in dynamics configurations in the presence of motor noise is very important for operating robots in the real world, and our work is a novel attempt in that direction. We introduce MANGA: Method Agnostic Neural-policy Generalization and Adaptation, that trains dynamics conditioned policies and efficiently learns to estimate the dynamics parameters of the environment given off-policy state-transition rollouts in the environment. Our scheme is agnostic to the type of training method used - both reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) strategies can be used. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by experimenting with four different MuJoCo agents and comparing against previously proposed transfer baselines.\n",
      "AI heralds a step-change in the performance and capability of wireless networks and other critical infrastructures. However, it may also cause irreversible environmental damage due to their high energy consumption. Here, we address this challenge in the context of 5G and beyond, where there is a complexity explosion in radio resource management (RRM). On the one hand, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a powerful tool for scalable optimization for high dimensional RRM problems in a dynamic environment. On the other hand, DRL algorithms consume a high amount of energy over time and risk compromising progress made in green radio research. This paper reviews and analyzes how to achieve green DRL for RRM via both architecture and algorithm innovations. Architecturally, a cloud based training and distributed decision-making DRL scheme is proposed, where RRM entities can make lightweight deep local decisions whilst assisted by on-cloud training and updating. On the algorithm level, compression approaches are introduced for both deep neural networks and the underlying Markov Decision Processes, enabling accurate low-dimensional representations of challenges. To scale learning across geographic areas, a spatial transfer learning scheme is proposed to further promote the learning efficiency of distributed DRL entities by exploiting the traffic demand correlations. Together, our proposed architecture and algorithms provide a vision for green and on-demand DRL capability.\n",
      "Efficient dispatching rule in manufacturing industry is key to ensure product on-time delivery and minimum past-due and inventory cost. Manufacturing, especially in the developed world, is moving towards on-demand manufacturing meaning a high mix, low volume product mix. This requires efficient dispatching that can work in dynamic and stochastic environments, meaning it allows for quick response to new orders received and can work over a disparate set of shop floor settings. In this paper we address this problem of dispatching in manufacturing. Using reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a new design to formulate the shop floor state as a 2-D matrix, incorporate job slack time into state representation, and design lateness and tardiness rewards function for dispatching purpose. However, maintaining a separate RL model for each production line on a manufacturing shop floor is costly and often infeasible. To address this, we enhance our deep RL model with an approach for dispatching policy transfer. This increases policy generalization and saves time and cost for model training and data collection. Experiments show that: (1) our approach performs the best in terms of total discounted reward and average lateness, tardiness, (2) the proposed policy transfer approach reduces training time and increases policy generalization.\n",

      "Automated in-vitro cell detection and counting have been a key theme for artificial and intelligent biological analysis such as biopsy, drug analysis and decease diagnosis. Along with the rapid development of microfluidics and lab-on-chip technologies, in-vitro live cell analysis has been one of the critical tasks for both research and industry communities. However, it is a great challenge to obtain and then predict the precise information of live cells from numerous microscopic videos and images. In this paper, we investigated in-vitro detection of white blood cells using deep neural networks, and discussed how state-of-the-art machine learning techniques could fulfil the needs of medical diagnosis. The approach we used in this study was based on Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster RCNNs), and a transfer learning process was applied to apply this technique to the microscopic detection of blood cells. Our experimental results demonstrated that fast and efficient analysis of blood cells via automated microscopic imaging can achieve much better accuracy and faster speed than the conventionally applied methods, implying a promising future of this technology to be applied to the microfluidic point-of-care medical devices.\n",
      "We reformulate the option framework as two parallel augmented MDPs. Under this novel formulation, all policy optimization algorithms can be used off the shelf to learn intra-option policies, option termination conditions, and a master policy over options. We apply an actor-critic algorithm on each augmented MDP, yielding the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) architecture. Furthermore, we show that, when state-value functions are used as critics, one critic can be expressed in terms of the other, and hence only one critic is necessary. We conduct an empirical study on challenging robot simulation tasks. In a transfer learning setting, DAC outperforms both its hierarchy-free counterpart and previous gradient-based option learning algorithms.\n",
      "Automated machine learning aims to automate the whole process of machine learning, including model configuration. In this paper, we focus on automated hyperparameter optimization (HPO) based on sequential model-based optimization (SMBO). Though conventional SMBO algorithms work well when abundant HPO trials are available, they are far from satisfactory in practical applications where a trial on a huge dataset may be so costly that an optimal hyperparameter configuration is expected to return in as few trials as possible. Observing that human experts draw on their expertise in a machine learning model by trying configurations that once performed well on other datasets, we are inspired to speed up HPO by transferring knowledge from historical HPO trials on other datasets. We propose an end-to-end and efficient HPO algorithm named as Transfer Neural Processes (TNP), which achieves transfer learning by incorporating trials on other datasets, initializing the model with well-generalized parameters, and learning an initial set of hyperparameters to evaluate. Experiments on extensive OpenML datasets and three computer vision datasets show that the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performance in at least one order of magnitude less trials.\n",

We introduce the novel architectural contribution of a Successor Feature Dependant Policy (SFDP) and adopt the concept of Variational Information Bottlenecks to achieve state of the art performance. VUSFA, our final architecture, is a straightforward approach that can be implemented using our open source repository. Our approach is generalizable, showed greater stability in training, and outperformed recent approaches in terms of transfer learning ability.\n",
      "Filtered back projection (FBP) is the most widely used method for image reconstruction in X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanners. The presence of hyper-dense materials in a scene, such as metals, can strongly attenuate X-rays, producing severe streaking artifacts in the reconstruction. These metal artifacts can greatly limit subsequent object delineation and information extraction from the images, restricting their diagnostic value. This problem is particularly acute in the security domain, where there is great heterogeneity in the objects that can appear in a scene, highly accurate decisions must be made quickly. The standard practical approaches to reducing metal artifacts in CT imagery are either simplistic non-adaptive interpolation-based projection data completion methods or direct image post-processing methods. These standard approaches have had limited success. Motivated primarily by security applications, we present a new deep-learning-based metal artifact reduction (MAR) approach that tackles the problem in the projection data domain. We treat the projection data corresponding to metal objects as missing data and train an adversarial deep network to complete the missing data in the projection domain. The subsequent complete projection data is then used with FBP to reconstruct image intended to be free of artifacts. This new approach results in an end-to-end MAR algorithm that is computationally efficient so practical and fits well into existing CT workflows allowing easy adoption in existing scanners. Training deep networks can be challenging, and another contribution of our work is to demonstrate that training data generated using an accurate X-ray simulation can be used to successfully train the deep network when combined with transfer learning using limited real data sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our algorithm on simulated and real examples.\n",
      "We study object recognition under the constraint that each object class is only represented by very few observations. Semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and few-shot recognition all concern with achieving fast generalization with few labeled data. In this paper, we propose a generic framework that utilizes unlabeled data to aid generalization for all three tasks. Our approach is to create much more training data through label propagation from the few labeled examples to a vast collection of unannotated images. The main contribution of the paper is that we show such a label propagation scheme can be highly effective when the similarity metric used for propagation is transferred from other related domains. We test various combinations of supervised and unsupervised metric learning methods with various label propagation algorithms. We find that our framework is very generic without being sensitive to any specific techniques. By taking advantage of unlabeled data in this way, we achieve significant improvements on all three tasks.\n",
      "Sharing knowledge between tasks is vital for efficient learning in a multi-task setting. However, most research so far has focused on the easier case where knowledge transfer is not harmful, i.e., where knowledge from one task cannot negatively impact the performance on another task. In contrast, we present an approach to multi-task deep reinforcement learning based on attention that does not require any a-priori assumptions about the relationships between tasks. Our attention network automatically groups task knowledge into sub-networks on a state level granularity. It thereby achieves positive knowledge transfer if possible, and avoids negative transfer in cases where tasks interfere. We test our algorithm against two state-of-the-art multi-task/transfer learning approaches and show comparable or superior performance while requiring fewer network parameters.\n",
      "Despite the remarkable success of Deep RL in learning control policies from raw pixels, the resulting models do not generalize. We demonstrate that a trained agent fails completely when facing small visual changes, and that fine-tuning---the common transfer learning paradigm---fails to adapt to these changes, to the extent that it is faster to re-train the model from scratch. We show that by separating the visual transfer task from the control policy we achieve substantially better sample efficiency and transfer behavior, allowing an agent trained on the source task to transfer well to the target tasks. The visual mapping from the target to the source domain is performed using unaligned GANs, resulting in a control policy that can be further improved using imitation learning from imperfect demonstrations. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic visual variants of the Breakout game, as well as on transfer between subsequent levels of Road Fighter, a Nintendo car-driving game. A visualization of our approach can be seen in https://youtu.be/4mnkzYyXMn4 and https://youtu.be/KCGTrQi6Ogo .\n",
      "Continual learning refers to the ability of a biological or artificial system to seamlessly learn from continuous streams of information while preventing catastrophic forgetting, i.e., a condition in which new incoming information strongly interferes with previously learned representations. Since it is unrealistic to provide artificial agents with all the necessary prior knowledge to effectively operate in real-world conditions, they must exhibit a rich set of learning capabilities enabling them to interact in complex environments with the aim to process and make sense of continuous streams of (often uncertain) information. While the vast majority of continual learning models are designed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting on simplified classification tasks, here we focus on continual learning for autonomous agents and robots required to operate in much more challenging experimental settings. In particular, we discuss well-established biological learning factors such as developmental and curriculum learning, transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation and their computational counterparts for modeling the progressive acquisition of increasingly complex knowledge and skills in a continual fashion.\n",
      "Transfer learning across different reinforcement learning (RL) tasks is becoming an increasingly valuable area of research. We consider a goal-based multi-task RL framework and mechanisms by which previously solved tasks can reduce sample complexity and regret when the agent is faced with a new task. Specifically, we introduce two metrics on the state space that encode notions of traversibility of the state space for an agent. Using these metrics a topological covering is constructed by way of a set of landmark states in a fully self-supervised manner. We show that these landmark coverings confer theoretical advantages for transfer learning within the goal-based multi-task RL setting. Specifically, we demonstrate three mechanisms by which landmark coverings can be used for successful transfer learning. First, we extend the Landmark Options Via Reflection (LOVR) framework to this new topological covering; second, we use the landmark-centric value functions themselves as features and define a greedy zombie policy that achieves near oracle performance on a sequence of zero-shot transfer tasks; finally, motivated by the second transfer mechanism, we introduce a learned reward function that provides a more dense reward signal for goal-based RL. Our novel topological landmark covering confers beneficial theoretical results, bounding the Q values at each state-action pair. In doing so, we introduce a mechanism that performs action-pruning at infeasible actions which cannot possibly be part of an optimal policy for the current goal.\n",
      "Automatic detection of colonic polyps is still an unsolved problem due to the large variation of polyps in terms of shape, texture, size, and color, and the existence of various polyp-like mimics during colonoscopy. In this study, we apply a recent region based convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for the automatic detection of polyps in images and videos obtained from colonoscopy examinations. We use a deep-CNN model (Inception Resnet) as a transfer learning scheme in the detection system. To overcome the polyp detection obstacles and the small number of polyp images, we examine image augmentation strategies for training deep networks. We further propose two efficient post-learning methods such as, automatic false positive learning and off-line learning, both of which can be incorporated with the region based detection system for reliable polyp detection. Using the large size of colonoscopy databases, experimental results demonstrate that the suggested detection systems show better performance compared to other systems in the literature. Furthermore, we show improved detection performance using the proposed post-learning schemes for colonoscopy videos.\n",
      "Transfer learning aims at building robust prediction models by transferring knowledge gained from one problem to another. In the semantic Web, learning tasks are enhanced with semantic representations. We exploit their semantics to augment transfer learning by dealing with when to transfer with semantic measurements and what to transfer with semantic embeddings. We further present a general framework that integrates the above measurements and embeddings with existing transfer learning algorithms for higher performance. It has demonstrated to be robust in two real-world applications: bus delay forecasting and air quality forecasting.\n",
      "Compared with shallow domain adaptation, recent progress in deep domain adaptation has shown that it can achieve higher predictive performance and stronger capacity to tackle structural data (e.g., image and sequential data). The underlying idea of deep domain adaptation is to bridge the gap between source and target domains in a joint space so that a supervised classifier trained on labeled source data can be nicely transferred to the target domain. This idea is certainly intuitive and powerful, however, limited theoretical understandings have been developed to support its underpinning principle. In this paper, we have provided a rigorous framework to explain why it is possible to close the gap of the target and source domains in the joint space. More specifically, we first study the loss incurred when performing transfer learning from the source to the target domain. This provides a theory that explains and generalizes existing work in deep domain adaptation which was mainly empirical. This enables us to further explain why closing the gap in the joint space can directly minimize the loss incurred for transfer learning between the two domains. To our knowledge, this offers the first theoretical result that characterizes a direct bound on the joint space and the gain of transfer learning via deep domain adaptation\n",
      "Exploration and adaptation to new tasks in a transfer learning setup is a central challenge in reinforcement learning. In this work, we build on the idea of modeling a distribution over policies in a Bayesian deep reinforcement learning setup to propose a transfer strategy. Recent works have shown to induce diversity in the learned policies by maximizing the entropy of a distribution of policies (Bachman et al., 2018; Garnelo et al., 2018) and thus, we postulate that our proposed approach leads to faster exploration resulting in improved transfer learning. We support our hypothesis by demonstrating favorable experimental results on a variety of settings on fully-observable GridWorld and partially observable MiniGrid (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018) environments.\n",
      "To meet the standard of differential privacy, noise is usually added into the original data, which inevitably deteriorates the predicting performance of subsequent learning algorithms. In this paper, motivated by the success of improving predicting performance by ensemble learning, we propose to enhance privacy-preserving logistic regression by stacking. We show that this can be done either by sample-based or feature-based partitioning. However, we prove that when privacy-budgets are the same, feature-based partitioning requires fewer samples than sample-based one, and thus likely has better empirical performance. As transfer learning is difficult to be integrated with a differential privacy guarantee, we further combine the proposed method with hypothesis transfer learning to address the problem of learning across different organizations. Finally, we not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark data sets, i.e., MNIST and NEWS20, but also apply it into a real application of cross-organizational diabetes prediction from RUIJIN data set, where privacy is of significant concern.\n",
      "The capability to perform facial analysis from video sequences has significant potential to positively impact in many areas of life. One such area relates to the medical domain to specifically aid in the diagnosis and rehabilitation of patients with facial palsy. With this application in mind, this paper presents an end-to-end framework, named 3DPalsyNet, for the tasks of mouth motion recognition and facial palsy grading. 3DPalsyNet utilizes a 3D CNN architecture with a ResNet backbone for the prediction of these dynamic tasks. Leveraging transfer learning from a 3D CNNs pre-trained on the Kinetics data set for general action recognition, the model is modified to apply joint supervised learning using center and softmax loss concepts. 3DPalsyNet is evaluated on a test set consisting of individuals with varying ranges of facial palsy and mouth motions and the results have shown an attractive level of classification accuracy in these task of 82% and 86% respectively. The frame duration and the loss function affect was studied in terms of the predictive qualities of the proposed 3DPalsyNet, where it was found shorter frame duration's of 8 performed best for this specific task. Centre loss and softmax have shown improvements in spatio-temporal feature learning than softmax loss alone, this is in agreement with earlier work involving the spatial domain.\n",
      "Understanding generalization in reinforcement learning (RL) is a significant challenge, as many common assumptions of traditional supervised learning theory do not apply. We focus on the special class of reparameterizable RL problems, where the trajectory distribution can be decomposed using the reparametrization trick. For this problem class, estimating the expected return is efficient and the trajectory can be computed deterministically given peripheral random variables, which enables us to study reparametrizable RL using supervised learning and transfer learning theory. Through these relationships, we derive guarantees on the gap between the expected and empirical return for both intrinsic and external errors, based on Rademacher complexity as well as the PAC-Bayes bound. Our bound suggests the generalization capability of reparameterizable RL is related to multiple factors including \"smoothness\" of the environment transition, reward and agent policy function class. We also empirically verify the relationship between the generalization gap and these factors through simulations.\n",
      "We compute the transition probability between two learning tasks, and show that it decomposes into two factors. The first depends on the geometry of the loss landscape of a model trained on each task, independent of any particular model used. This is related to an information theoretic distance function, but is insufficient to predict success in transfer learning, as nearby tasks can be unreachable via fine-tuning. The second factor depends on the ease of traversing the path between two tasks. With this dynamic component, we derive strict lower bounds on the complexity necessary to learn a task starting from the solution to another, which is one of the most common forms of transfer learning.\n",
      "In this working notes paper, we describe IBM Research AI (Almaden) team's participation in the ImageCLEF 2019 VQA-Med competition. The challenge consists of four question-answering tasks based on radiology images. The diversity of imaging modalities, organs and disease types combined with a small imbalanced training set made this a highly complex problem. To overcome these difficulties, we implemented a modular pipeline architecture that utilized transfer learning and multi-task learning. Our findings led to the development of a novel model called Supporting Facts Network (SFN). The main idea behind SFN is to cross-utilize information from upstream tasks to improve the accuracy on harder downstream ones. This approach significantly improved the scores achieved in the validation set (18 point improvement in F-1 score). Finally, we submitted four runs to the competition and were ranked seventh.\n",
      "We present SOSELETO (SOurce SELEction for Target Optimization), a new method for exploiting a source dataset to solve a classification problem on a target dataset. SOSELETO is based on the following simple intuition: some source examples are more informative than others for the target problem. To capture this intuition, source samples are each given weights; these weights are solved for jointly with the source and target classification problems via a bilevel optimization scheme. The target therefore gets to choose the source samples which are most informative for its own classification task. Furthermore, the bilevel nature of the optimization acts as a kind of regularization on the target, mitigating overfitting. SOSELETO may be applied to both classic transfer learning, as well as the problem of training on datasets with noisy labels; we show state of the art results on both of these problems.\n",
      "Cooking is a task that must be performed in a daily basis, and thus it is an activity that many people take for granted. For humans preparing a meal comes naturally, but for robots even preparing a simple sandwich results in an extremely difficult task. In robotics, designing kitchen robots is complicated since cooking relies on a variety of physical interactions that are dependent on different conditions such as changes in the environment, proper execution of sequential instructions, along with motions, and detection of the different states in which cooking-ingredients can be in for their correct grasping and manipulation. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of state recognition and propose a fine tuned convolutional neural network that makes use of transfer learning by reusing the Inception V3 pre-trained model. The model is trained and validated on a cooking dataset consisting of eleven states (e.g. peeled, diced, whole, etc.). The work presented on this paper could provide insight into finding a potential solution to the problem.\n",
      "Transfer learning is widely used in deep neural network models when there are few labeled examples available. The common approach is to take a pre-trained network in a similar task and finetune the model parameters. This is usually done blindly without a pre-selection from a set of pre-trained models, or by finetuning a set of models trained on different tasks and selecting the best performing one by cross-validation. We address this problem by proposing an approach to assess the relationship between visual tasks and their task-specific models. Our method uses Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA), which is commonly used to find a correlation between neuronal responses from brain data and models. With RSA we obtain a similarity score among tasks by computing correlations between models trained on different tasks. Our method is efficient as it requires only pre-trained models, and a few images with no further training. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method for generating task taxonomy on Taskonomy dataset. We next evaluate the relationship of RSA with the transfer learning performance on Taskonomy tasks and a new task: Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. Our results reveal that models trained on tasks with higher similarity score show higher transfer learning performance. Surprisingly, the best transfer learning result for Pascal VOC semantic segmentation is not obtained from the pre-trained model on semantic segmentation, probably due to the domain differences, and our method successfully selects the high performing models.\n",
      "Purpose: Lung nodules have very diverse shapes and sizes, which makes classifying them as benign/malignant a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict the malignancy of nodules that have the capability to analyze the shape and size of a nodule using a global feature extractor, as well as the density and structure of the nodule using a local feature extractor. Methods: We propose to use Residual Blocks with a 3x3 kernel size for local feature extraction, and Non-Local Blocks to extract the global features. The Non-Local Block has the ability to extract global features without using a huge number of parameters. The key idea behind the Non-Local Block is to apply matrix multiplications between features on the same feature maps. Results: We trained and validated the proposed method on the LIDC-IDRI dataset which contains 1,018 computed tomography (CT) scans. We followed a rigorous procedure for experimental setup namely, 10-fold cross-validation and ignored the nodules that had been annotated by less than 3 radiologists. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results with AUC=95.62%, while significantly outperforming other baseline methods. Conclusions: Our proposed Deep Local-Global network has the capability to accurately extract both local and global features. Our new method outperforms state-of-the-art architecture including Densenet and Resnet with transfer learning.\n",
      "Cross-lingual Text Classification (CLC) consists of automatically classifying, according to a common set C of classes, documents each written in one of a set of languages L, and doing so more accurately than when naively classifying each document via its corresponding language-specific classifier. In order to obtain an increase in the classification accuracy for a given language, the system thus needs to also leverage the training examples written in the other languages. We tackle multilabel CLC via funnelling, a new ensemble learning method that we propose here. Funnelling consists of generating a two-tier classification system where all documents, irrespectively of language, are classified by the same (2nd-tier) classifier. For this classifier all documents are represented in a common, language-independent feature space consisting of the posterior probabilities generated by 1st-tier, language-dependent classifiers. This allows the classification of all test documents, of any language, to benefit from the information present in all training documents, of any language. We present substantial experiments, run on publicly available multilingual text collections, in which funnelling is shown to significantly outperform a number of state-of-the-art baselines. All code and datasets (in vector form) are made publicly available.\n",
      "Transferring knowledge from a teacher neural network pretrained on the same or a similar task to a student neural network can significantly improve the performance of the student neural network. Existing knowledge transfer approaches match the activations or the corresponding hand-crafted features of the teacher and the student networks. We propose an information-theoretic framework for knowledge transfer which formulates knowledge transfer as maximizing the mutual information between the teacher and the student networks. We compare our method with existing knowledge transfer methods on both knowledge distillation and transfer learning tasks and show that our method consistently outperforms existing methods. We further demonstrate the strength of our method on knowledge transfer across heterogeneous network architectures by transferring knowledge from a convolutional neural network (CNN) to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on CIFAR-10. The resulting MLP significantly outperforms the-state-of-the-art methods and it achieves similar performance to the CNN with a single convolutional layer.\n",
      "In complex transfer learning scenarios new tasks might not be tightly linked to previous tasks. Approaches that transfer information contained only in the final parameters of a source model will therefore struggle. Instead, transfer learning at a higher level of abstraction is needed. We propose Leap, a framework that achieves this by transferring knowledge across learning processes. We associate each task with a manifold on which the training process travels from initialization to final parameters and construct a meta-learning objective that minimizes the expected length of this path. Our framework leverages only information obtained during training and can be computed on the fly at negligible cost. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods, both in meta-learning and transfer learning, on a set of computer vision tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that Leap can transfer knowledge across learning processes in demanding reinforcement learning environments (Atari) that involve millions of gradient steps.\n",
      "We consider a problem of learning the reward and policy from expert examples under unknown dynamics. Our proposed method builds on the framework of generative adversarial networks and introduces the empowerment-regularized maximum-entropy inverse reinforcement learning to learn near-optimal rewards and policies. Empowerment-based regularization prevents the policy from overfitting to expert demonstrations, which advantageously leads to more generalized behaviors that result in learning near-optimal rewards. Our method simultaneously learns empowerment through variational information maximization along with the reward and policy under the adversarial learning formulation. We evaluate our approach on various high-dimensional complex control tasks. We also test our learned rewards in challenging transfer learning problems where training and testing environments are made to be different from each other in terms of dynamics or structure. The results show that our proposed method not only learns near-optimal rewards and policies that are matching expert behavior but also performs significantly better than state-of-the-art inverse reinforcement learning algorithms.\n",
      "Modeling buildings' heat dynamics is a complex process which depends on various factors including weather, building thermal capacity, insulation preservation, and residents' behavior. Gray-box models offer a causal inference of those dynamics expressed in few parameters specific to built environments. These parameters can provide compelling insights into the characteristics of building artifacts and have various applications such as forecasting HVAC usage, indoor temperature control monitoring of built environments, etc. In this paper, we present a systematic study of modeling buildings' thermal characteristics and thus derive the parameters of built conditions with a Bayesian approach. We build a Bayesian state-space model that can adapt and incorporate buildings' thermal equations and propose a generalized solution that can easily adapt prior knowledge regarding the parameters. We show that a faster approximate approach using variational inference for parameter estimation can provide similar parameters as that of a more time-consuming Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We perform extensive evaluations on two datasets to understand the generative process and show that the Bayesian approach is more interpretable. We further study the effects of prior selection for the model parameters and transfer learning, where we learn parameters from one season and use them to fit the model in the other. We perform extensive evaluations on controlled and real data traces to enumerate buildings' parameter within a 95% credible interval.\n",
      "Transfer-learning and meta-learning are two effective methods to apply knowledge learned from large data sources to new tasks. In few-class, few-shot target task settings (i.e. when there are only a few classes and training examples available in the target task), meta-learning approaches that optimize for future task learning have outperformed the typical transfer approach of initializing model weights from a pre-trained starting point. But as we experimentally show, meta-learning algorithms that work well in the few-class setting do not generalize well in many-shot and many-class cases. In this paper, we propose a joint training approach that combines both transfer-learning and meta-learning. Benefiting from the advantages of each, our method obtains improved generalization performance on unseen target tasks in both few- and many-class and few- and many-shot scenarios.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been around for decades and employed to solve various sequential decision-making problems. These algorithms however have faced great challenges when dealing with high-dimensional environments. The recent development of deep learning has enabled RL methods to drive optimal policies for sophisticated and capable agents, which can perform efficiently in these challenging environments. This paper addresses an important aspect of deep RL related to situations that require multiple agents to communicate and cooperate to solve complex tasks. A survey of different approaches to problems related to multi-agent deep RL (MADRL) is presented, including non-stationarity, partial observability, continuous state and action spaces, multi-agent training schemes, multi-agent transfer learning. The merits and demerits of the reviewed methods will be analyzed and discussed, with their corresponding applications explored. It is envisaged that this review provides insights about various MADRL methods and can lead to future development of more robust and highly useful multi-agent learning methods for solving real-world problems.\n",
      "StarCraft II poses a grand challenge for reinforcement learning. The main difficulties of it include huge state and action space and a long-time horizon. In this paper, we investigate a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for StarCraft II. The hierarchy involves two levels of abstraction. One is the macro-action automatically extracted from expert's trajectories, which reduces the action space in an order of magnitude yet remains effective. The other is a two-layer hierarchical architecture which is modular and easy to scale, enabling a curriculum transferring from simpler tasks to more complex tasks. The reinforcement training algorithm for this architecture is also investigated. On a 64x64 map and using restrictive units, we achieve a winning rate of more than 99\\% against the difficulty level-1 built-in AI. Through the curriculum transfer learning algorithm and a mixture of combat model, we can achieve over 93\\% winning rate of Protoss against the most difficult non-cheating built-in AI (level-7) of Terran, training within two days using a single machine with only 48 CPU cores and 8 K40 GPUs. It also shows strong generalization performance, when tested against never seen opponents including cheating levels built-in AI and all levels of Zerg and Protoss built-in AI. We hope this study could shed some light on the future research of large-scale reinforcement learning.\n",
      "Transfer learning which aims at utilizing knowledge learned from one problem (source domain) to solve another different but related problem (target domain) has attracted wide research attentions. However, the current transfer learning methods are mostly uninterpretable, especially to people without ML expertise. In this extended abstract, we brief introduce two knowledge graph (KG) based frameworks towards human understandable transfer learning explanation. The first one explains the transferability of features learned by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from one domain to another through pre-training and fine-tuning, while the second justifies the model of a target domain predicted by models from multiple source domains in zero-shot learning (ZSL). Both methods utilize KG and its reasoning capability to provide rich and human understandable explanations to the transfer procedure.\n",
      "Risk stratification (characterization) of tumors from radiology images can be more accurate and faster with computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools. Tumor characterization through such tools can also enable non-invasive cancer staging, prognosis, and foster personalized treatment planning as a part of precision medicine. In this study, we propose both supervised and unsupervised machine learning strategies to improve tumor characterization. Our first approach is based on supervised learning for which we demonstrate significant gains with deep learning algorithms, particularly by utilizing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer Learning. Motivated by the radiologists' interpretations of the scans, we then show how to incorporate task dependent feature representations into a CAD system via a graph-regularized sparse Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework. In the second approach, we explore an unsupervised learning algorithm to address the limited availability of labeled training data, a common problem in medical imaging applications. Inspired by learning from label proportion (LLP) approaches in computer vision, we propose to use proportion-SVM for characterizing tumors. We also seek the answer to the fundamental question about the goodness of \"deep features\" for unsupervised tumor classification. We evaluate our proposed supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms on two different tumor diagnosis challenges: lung and pancreas with 1018 CT and 171 MRI scans, respectively, and obtain the state-of-the-art sensitivity and specificity results in both problems.\n",
      "Transfer learning is a widely used strategy in medical image analysis. Instead of only training a network with a limited amount of data from the target task of interest, we can first train the network with other, potentially larger source datasets, creating a more robust model. The source datasets do not have to be related to the target task. For a classification task in lung CT images, we could use both head CT images, or images of cats, as the source. While head CT images appear more similar to lung CT images, the number and diversity of cat images might lead to a better model overall. In this survey we review a number of papers that have performed similar comparisons. Although the answer to which strategy is best seems to be \"it depends\", we discuss a number of research directions we need to take as a community, to gain more understanding of this topic.\n",
      "Deep reinforcement learning agents have recently been successful across a variety of discrete and continuous control tasks; however, they can be slow to train and require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn a suitable policy. This is borne out by the fact that a reinforcement learning agent has no prior knowledge of the world, no pre-existing data to depend on and so must devote considerable time to exploration. Transfer learning can alleviate some of the problems by leveraging learning done on some source task to help learning on some target task. Our work presents an algorithm for initialising the hidden feature representation of the target task. We propose a domain adaptation method to transfer state representations and demonstrate transfer across domains, tasks and action spaces. We utilise adversarial domain adaptation ideas combined with an adversarial autoencoder architecture. We align our new policies' representation space with a pre-trained source policy, taking target task data generated from a random policy. We demonstrate that this initialisation step provides significant improvement when learning a new reinforcement learning task, which highlights the wide applicability of adversarial adaptation methods; even as the task and label/action space also changes.\n",
      "In this work, we propose an advanced AI based grading system for OCT images.

It uses quasi random augmentation that outputs confidence values for diseases prevalence during inference. Its a fully automated retinal OCT analysis AI system capable of pathological lesions understanding without any offline preprocessing/postprocessing step or manual feature extraction.

      "In recent years, supervised machine learning models have demonstrated tremendous success in a variety of application domains. Despite the promising results, these successful models are data hungry and their performance relies heavily on the size of training data. However, in many healthcare applications it is difficult to collect sufficiently large training datasets. Transfer learning can help overcome this issue by transferring the knowledge from readily available datasets (source) to a new dataset (target). In this work, we propose a hybrid instance-based transfer learning method that outperforms a set of baselines including state-of-the-art instance-based transfer learning approaches. Our method uses a probabilistic weighting strategy to fuse information from the source domain to the model learned in the target domain. Our method is generic, applicable to multiple source domains, and robust with respect to negative transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments for two different applications.\n",
      "Curriculum learning in reinforcement learning is a training methodology that seeks to speed up learning of a difficult target task, by first training on a series of simpler tasks and transferring the knowledge acquired to the target task. Automatically choosing a sequence of such tasks (i.e. a curriculum) is an open problem that has been the subject of much recent work in this area. In this paper, we build upon a recent method for curriculum design, which formulates the curriculum sequencing problem as a Markov Decision Process. We extend this model to handle multiple transfer learning algorithms, and show for the first time that a curriculum policy over this MDP can be learned from experience. We explore various representations that make this possible, and evaluate our approach by learning curriculum policies for multiple agents in two different domains. The results show that our method produces curricula that can train agents to perform on a target task as fast or faster than existing methods.\n",
      "In the quest for efficient and robust reinforcement learning methods, both model-free and model-based approaches offer advantages. In this paper we propose a new way of explicitly bridging both approaches via a shared low-dimensional learned encoding of the environment, meant to capture summarizing abstractions. We show that the modularity brought by this approach leads to good generalization while being computationally efficient, with planning happening in a smaller latent state space. In addition, this approach recovers a sufficient low-dimensional representation of the environment, which opens up new strategies for interpretable AI, exploration and transfer learning.\n",
      "Transfer learning for deep neural networks is the process of first training a base network on a source dataset, and then transferring the learned features (the network's weights) to a second network to be trained on a target dataset. This idea has been shown to improve deep neural network's generalization capabilities in many computer vision tasks such as image recognition and object localization. Apart from these applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also recently gained popularity in the Time Series Classification (TSC) community. However, unlike for image recognition problems, transfer learning techniques have not yet been investigated thoroughly for the TSC task. This is surprising as the accuracy of deep learning models for TSC could potentially be improved if the model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained neural network instead of training it from scratch. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating how to transfer deep CNNs for the TSC task. To evaluate the potential of transfer learning, we performed extensive experiments using the UCR archive which is the largest publicly available TSC benchmark containing 85 datasets. For each dataset in the archive, we pre-trained a model and then fine-tuned it on the other datasets resulting in 7140 different deep neural networks. These experiments revealed that transfer learning can improve or degrade the model's predictions depending on the dataset used for transfer. Therefore, in an effort to predict the best source dataset for a given target dataset, we propose a new method relying on Dynamic Time Warping to measure inter-datasets similarities. We describe how our method can guide the transfer to choose the best source dataset leading to an improvement in accuracy on 71 out of 85 datasets.\n",
      "In this paper, we conduct an empirical investigation of neural query graph ranking approaches for the task of complex question answering over knowledge graphs. We experiment with six different ranking models and propose a novel self-attention based slot matching model which exploits the inherent structure of query graphs, our logical form of choice. Our proposed model generally outperforms the other models on two QA datasets over the DBpedia knowledge graph, evaluated in different settings. In addition, we show that transfer learning from the larger of those QA datasets to the smaller dataset yields substantial improvements, effectively offsetting the general lack of training data.\n",
      "Deep neural networks have led to a series of breakthroughs in computer vision given sufficient annotated training datasets. For novel tasks with limited labeled data, the prevalent approach is to transfer the knowledge learned in the pre-trained models to the new tasks by fine-tuning. Classic model fine-tuning utilizes the fact that well trained neural networks appear to learn cross domain features. These features are treated equally during transfer learning. In this paper, we explore the impact of feature selection in model fine-tuning by introducing a transfer module, which assigns weights to features extracted from pre-trained models. The proposed transfer module proves the importance of feature selection for transferring models from source to target domains. It is shown to significantly improve upon fine-tuning results with only marginal extra computational cost. We also incorporate an auxiliary classifier as an extra regularizer to avoid over-fitting. Finally, we build a Gated Transfer Network (GTN) based on our transfer module and achieve state-of-the-art results on six different tasks.\n",
      "Transportation and traffic are currently undergoing a rapid increase in terms of both scale and complexity. At the same time, an increasing share of traffic participants are being transformed into agents driven or supported by artificial intelligence resulting in mixed-intelligence traffic. This work explores the implications of distributed decision-making in mixed-intelligence traffic. The investigations are carried out on the basis of an online-simulated highway scenario, namely the MIT \\emph{DeepTraffic} simulation. In the first step traffic agents are trained by means of a deep reinforcement learning approach, being deployed inside an elitist evolutionary algorithm for hyperparameter search. The resulting architectures and training parameters are then utilized in order to either train a single autonomous traffic agent and transfer the learned weights onto a multi-agent scenario or else to conduct multi-agent learning directly. Both learning strategies are evaluated on different ratios of mixed-intelligence traffic. The strategies are assessed according to the average speed of all agents driven by artificial intelligence. Traffic patterns that provoke a reduction in traffic flow are analyzed with respect to the different strategies.\n",
      "In the legal domain it is important to differentiate between words in general, and afterwards to link the occurrences of the same entities.

Transfer Learning aims to utilize the learned knowledge from source tasks to help new tasks to improve the sample complexity of the new tasks. Considering that data collection in RL is both more time and cost consuming and Q-learning converges slowly comparing to supervised learning, different kinds of transfer RL algorithms are designed. However, most of them are heuristic with no theoretical guarantee of the convergence rate. Therefore, it is important for us to clearly understand when and how will transfer learning help RL method and provide the theoretical guarantee for the improvement of the sample complexity. In this paper, we propose to transfer the Q-function learned in the source task to the target of the Q-learning in the new task when certain safe conditions are satisfied. We call this new transfer Q-learning method target transfer Q-Learning. The safe conditions are necessary to avoid the harm to the new tasks and thus ensure the convergence of the algorithm. We study the convergence rate of the target transfer Q-learning. We prove that if the two tasks are similar with respect to the MDPs, the optimal Q-functions in the source and new RL tasks are similar which means the error of the transferred target Q-function in new MDP is small. Also, the convergence rate analysis shows that the target transfer Q-Learning will converge faster than Q-learning if the error of the transferred target Q-function is smaller than the current Q-function in the new task. Based on our theoretical results, we design the safe condition as the Bellman error of the transferred target Q-function is less than the current Q-function. Our experiments are consistent with our theoretical founding and verified the effectiveness of our proposed target transfer Q-learning method.\n",
      "Automatic emotion recognition is a challenging task. In this paper, we present our effort for the audio-video based sub-challenge of the Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) 2018 challenge, which requires participants to assign a single emotion label to the video clip from the six universal emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sad and Surprise) and Neutral. The proposed multimodal emotion recognition system takes audio, video and text information into account. Except for handcraft features, we also extract bottleneck features from deep neutral networks (DNNs) via transfer learning. Both temporal classifiers and non-temporal classifiers are evaluated to obtain the best unimodal emotion classification result. Then possibilities are extracted and passed into the Beam Search Fusion (BS-Fusion). We test our method in the EmotiW 2018 challenge and we gain promising results. Compared with the baseline system, there is a significant improvement. We achieve 60.34% accuracy on the testing dataset, which is only 1.5% lower than the winner. It shows that our method is very competitive.\n",
      "The ability to extract the sequence of game events for a given player's play-through has traditionally required access to the game's engine or source code. This serves as a barrier to researchers, developers, and hobbyists who might otherwise benefit from these game logs. In this paper we present two approaches to derive game logs from game video via convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. We evaluate the approaches in a Super Mario Bros. clone, Mega Man and Skyrim. Our results demonstrate our approach outperforms random forest and other transfer baselines.\n",
      "We develop new algorithms for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, combining recent developments in transfer learning for neural networks with insights from the causal inference literature. By taking advantage of transfer learning, we are able to efficiently use different data sources that are related to the same underlying causal mechanisms. We compare our algorithms with those in the extant literature using extensive simulation studies based on large-scale voter persuasion experiments and the MNIST database. Our methods can perform an order of magnitude better than existing benchmarks while using a fraction of the data.\n",
      "We present a scalable approach for Detecting Objects by transferring Common-sense Knowledge (DOCK) from source to target categories. In our setting, the training data for the source categories have bounding box annotations, while those for the target categories only have image-level annotations. Current state-of-the-art approaches focus on image-level visual or semantic similarity to adapt a detector trained on the source categories to the new target categories. In contrast, our key idea is to (i) use similarity not at the image-level, but rather at the region-level, and (ii) leverage richer common-sense (based on attribute, spatial, etc.) to guide the algorithm towards learning the correct detections. We acquire such common-sense cues automatically from readily-available knowledge bases without any extra human effort. On the challenging MS COCO dataset, we find that common-sense knowledge can substantially improve detection performance over existing transfer-learning baselines.\n",
      "Neural network-based clustering has recently gained popularity, and in particular a constrained clustering formulation has been proposed to perform transfer learning and image category discovery using deep learning. The core idea is to formulate a clustering objective with pairwise constraints that can be used to train a deep clustering network; therefore the cluster assignments and their underlying feature representations are jointly optimized end-to-end. In this work, we provide a novel clustering formulation to address scalability issues of previous work in terms of optimizing deeper networks and larger amounts of categories. The proposed objective directly minimizes the negative log-likelihood of cluster assignment with respect to the pairwise constraints, has no hyper-parameters, and demonstrates improved scalability and performance on both supervised learning and unsupervised transfer learning.\n",
      "Transfer learning allows practitioners to recognize and apply knowledge learned in previous tasks (source task) to new tasks or new domains (target task), which share some commonality. The two important factors impacting the performance of transfer learning models are: (a) the size of the target dataset, and (b) the similarity in distribution between source and target domains. Thus far, there has been little investigation into just how important these factors are. In this paper, we investigate the impact of target dataset size and source/target domain similarity on model performance through a series of experiments. We find that more data is always beneficial, and model performance improves linearly with the log of data size, until we are out of data. As source/target domains differ, more data is required and fine tuning will render better performance than feature extraction. When source/target domains are similar and data size is small, fine tuning and feature extraction renders equivalent performance. Our hope is that by beginning this quantitative investigation on the effect of data volume and domain similarity in transfer learning we might inspire others to explore the significance of data in developing more accurate statistical models.\n",
      "Current reinforcement learning (RL) methods can successfully learn single tasks but often generalize poorly to modest perturbations in task domain or training procedure. In this work, we present a decoupled learning strategy for RL that creates a shared representation space where knowledge can be robustly transferred. We separate learning the task representation, the forward dynamics, the inverse dynamics and the reward function of the domain, and show that this decoupling improves performance within the task, transfers well to changes in dynamics and reward, and can be effectively used for online planning. Empirical results show good performance in both continuous and discrete RL domains.\n",
      "Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL) has made several breakthroughs in recent years in applications ranging from complex control tasks in unmanned vehicles to game playing. Despite their success, deep RL still lacks several important capacities of human intelligence, such as transfer learning, abstraction and interpretability. Deep Symbolic Reinforcement Learning (DSRL) seeks to incorporate such capacities to deep Q-networks (DQN) by learning a relevant symbolic representation prior to using Q-learning. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of DSRL, which we call Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Common Sense (SRL+CS), offering a better balance between generalization and specialization, inspired by principles of common sense when assigning rewards and aggregating Q-values. Experiments reported in this paper show that SRL+CS learns consistently faster than Q-learning and DSRL, achieving also a higher accuracy. In the hardest case, where agents were trained in a deterministic environment and tested in a random environment, SRL+CS achieves nearly 100% average accuracy compared to DSRL's 70% and DQN's 50% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of near perfect zero-shot transfer learning using Reinforcement Learning.\n",
      "Do visual tasks have a relationship, or are they unrelated? For instance, could having surface normals simplify estimating the depth of an image? Intuition answers these questions positively, implying existence of a structure among visual tasks. Knowing this structure has notable values; it is the concept underlying transfer learning and provides a principled way for identifying redundancies across tasks, e.g., to seamlessly reuse supervision among related tasks or solve many tasks in one system without piling up the complexity.   We proposes a fully computational approach for modeling the structure of space of visual tasks. This is done via finding (first and higher-order) transfer learning dependencies across a dictionary of twenty six 2D, 2.5D, 3D, and semantic tasks in a latent space. The product is a computational taxonomic map for task transfer learning. We study the consequences of this structure, e.g. nontrivial emerged relationships, and exploit them to reduce the demand for labeled data. For example, we show that the total number of labeled datapoints needed for solving a set of 10 tasks can be reduced by roughly 2/3 (compared to training independently) while keeping the performance nearly the same. We provide a set of tools for computing and probing this taxonomical structure including a solver that users can employ to devise efficient supervision policies for their use cases.\n",
      "In this paper, we study the problem of learning image classification models with label noise. Existing approaches depending on human supervision are generally not scalable as manually identifying correct or incorrect labels is time-consuming, whereas approaches not relying on human supervision are scalable but less effective. To reduce the amount of human supervision for label noise cleaning, we introduce CleanNet, a joint neural embedding network, which only requires a fraction of the classes being manually verified to provide the knowledge of label noise that can be transferred to other classes. We further integrate CleanNet and conventional convolutional neural network classifier into one framework for image classification learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on both of the label noise detection task and the image classification on noisy data task on several large-scale datasets. Experimental results show that CleanNet can reduce label noise detection error rate on held-out classes where no human supervision available by 41.5% compared to current weakly supervised methods. It also achieves 47% of the performance gain of verifying all images with only 3.2% images verified on an image classification task. Source code and dataset will be available at kuanghuei.github.io/CleanNetProject.\n",
      "With access to large datasets, deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved human-level accuracy in image and speech recognition tasks. However, in chemistry, data is inherently small and fragmented. In this work, we develop an approach of using rule-based knowledge for training ChemNet, a transferable and generalizable deep neural network for chemical property prediction that learns in a weak-supervised manner from large unlabeled chemical databases. When coupled with transfer learning approaches to predict other smaller datasets for chemical properties that it was not originally trained on, we show that ChemNet's accuracy outperforms contemporary DNN models that were trained using conventional supervised learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ChemNet pre-training approach is equally effective on both CNN (Chemception) and RNN (SMILES2vec) models, indicating that this approach is network architecture agnostic and is effective across multiple data modalities. Our results indicate a pre-trained ChemNet that incorporates chemistry domain knowledge, enables the development of generalizable neural networks for more accurate prediction of novel chemical properties.\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel method to perform transfer learning across domains and tasks, formulating it as a problem of learning to cluster. The key insight is that, in addition to features, we can transfer similarity information and this is sufficient to learn a similarity function and clustering network to perform both domain adaptation and cross-task transfer learning. We begin by reducing categorical information to pairwise constraints, which only considers whether two instances belong to the same class or not. This similarity is category-agnostic and can be learned from data in the source domain using a similarity network. We then present two novel approaches for performing transfer learning using this similarity function. First, for unsupervised domain adaptation, we design a new loss function to regularize classification with a constrained clustering loss, hence learning a clustering network with the transferred similarity metric generating the training inputs. Second, for cross-task learning (i.e., unsupervised clustering with unseen categories), we propose a framework to reconstruct and estimate the number of semantic clusters, again using the clustering network. Since the similarity network is noisy, the key is to use a robust clustering algorithm, and we show that our formulation is more robust than the alternative constrained and unconstrained clustering approaches. Using this method, we first show state of the art results for the challenging cross-task problem, applied on Omniglot and ImageNet. Our results show that we can reconstruct semantic clusters with high accuracy. We then evaluate the performance of cross-domain transfer using images from the Office-31 and SVHN-MNIST tasks and present top accuracy on both datasets. Our approach doesn't explicitly deal with domain discrepancy. If we combine with a domain adaptation loss, it shows further improvement.\n",
      "Learning-based approaches to robotic manipulation are limited by the scalability of data collection and accessibility of labels. In this paper, we present a multi-task domain adaptation framework for instance grasping in cluttered scenes by utilizing simulated robot experiments. Our neural network takes monocular RGB images and the instance segmentation mask of a specified target object as inputs, and predicts the probability of successfully grasping the specified object for each candidate motor command. The proposed transfer learning framework trains a model for instance grasping in simulation and uses a domain-adversarial loss to transfer the trained model to real robots using indiscriminate grasping data, which is available both in simulation and the real world. We evaluate our model in real-world robot experiments, comparing it with alternative model architectures as well as an indiscriminate grasping baseline.\n",
      "Deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated increasing capabilities for continuous control problems, including agents that can move with skill and agility through their environment. An open problem in this setting is that of developing good strategies for integrating or merging policies for multiple skills, where each individual skill is a specialist in a specific skill and its associated state distribution. We extend policy distillation methods to the continuous action setting and leverage this technique to combine expert policies, as evaluated in the domain of simulated bipedal locomotion across different classes of terrain. We also introduce an input injection method for augmenting an existing policy network to exploit new input features. Lastly, our method uses transfer learning to assist in the efficient acquisition of new skills. The combination of these methods allows a policy to be incrementally augmented with new skills. We compare our progressive learning and integration via distillation (PLAID) method against three alternative baselines.\n",
      "Intrinsic decomposition from a single image is a highly challenging task, due to its inherent ambiguity and the scarcity of training data. In contrast to traditional fully supervised learning approaches, in this paper we propose learning intrinsic image decomposition by explaining the input image. Our model, the Rendered Intrinsics Network (RIN), joins together an image decomposition pipeline, which predicts reflectance, shape, and lighting conditions given a single image, with a recombination function, a learned shading model used to recompose the original input based off of intrinsic image predictions. Our network can then use unsupervised reconstruction error as an additional signal to improve its intermediate representations. This allows large-scale unlabeled data to be useful during training, and also enables transferring learned knowledge to images of unseen object categories, lighting conditions, and shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs well on both intrinsic image decomposition and knowledge transfer.\n",
      "Catastrophic forgetting is a problem of neural networks that loses the information of the first task after training the second task. Here, we propose a method, i.e. incremental moment matching (IMM), to resolve this problem. IMM incrementally matches the moment of the posterior distribution of the neural network which is trained on the first and the second task, respectively. To make the search space of posterior parameter smooth, the IMM procedure is complemented by various transfer learning techniques including weight transfer, L2-norm of the old and the new parameter, and a variant of dropout with the old parameter. We analyze our approach on a variety of datasets including the MNIST, CIFAR-10, Caltech-UCSD-Birds, and Lifelog datasets. The experimental results show that IMM achieves state-of-the-art performance by balancing the information between an old and a new network.\n",
      "Recent work in deep reinforcement learning has allowed algorithms to learn complex tasks such as Atari 2600 games just from the reward provided by the game, but these algorithms presently require millions of training steps in order to learn, making them approximately five orders of magnitude slower than humans. One reason for this is that humans build robust shared representations that are applicable to collections of problems, making it much easier to assimilate new variants. This paper first introduces the idea of automatically-generated game sets to aid in transfer learning research, and then demonstrates the utility of shared representations by showing that models can substantially benefit from the incorporation of relevant architectural priors. This technique affords a remarkable 50x positive transfer on a toy problem-set.\n",
      "We view intersection handling on autonomous vehicles as a reinforcement learning problem, and study its behavior in a transfer learning setting. We show that a network trained on one type of intersection generally is not able to generalize to other intersections. However, a network that is pre-trained on one intersection and fine-tuned on another performs better on the new task compared to training in isolation. This network also retains knowledge of the prior task, even though some forgetting occurs. Finally, we show that the benefits of fine-tuning hold when transferring simulated intersection handling knowledge to a real autonomous vehicle.\n",
      "We introduce a new formulation of the Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process (HiP-MDP), a framework for modeling families of related tasks using low-dimensional latent embeddings. Our new framework correctly models the joint uncertainty in the latent parameters and the state space. We also replace the original Gaussian Process-based model with a Bayesian Neural Network, enabling more scalable inference. Thus, we expand the scope of the HiP-MDP to applications with higher dimensions and more complex dynamics.\n",
      "Performance of data-driven network for tumor classification varies with stain-style of histopathological images. This article proposes the stain-style transfer (SST) model based on conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) which is to learn not only the certain color distribution but also the corresponding histopathological pattern. Our model considers feature-preserving loss in addition to well-known GAN loss. Consequently our model does not only transfers initial stain-styles to the desired one but also prevent the degradation of tumor classifier on transferred images. The model is examined using the CAMELYON16 dataset.\n",
      "Active appearance models (AAMs) are a class of generative models that have seen tremendous success in face analysis. However, model learning depends on the availability of detailed annotation of canonical landmark points. As a result, when accurate AAM fitting is required on a different set of variations (expression, pose, identity), a new dataset is collected and annotated. To overcome the need for time consuming data collection and annotation, transfer learning approaches have received recent attention. The goal is to transfer knowledge from previously available datasets (source) to a new dataset (target). We propose a subspace transfer learning method, in which we select a subspace from the source that best describes the target space. We propose a metric to compute the directional similarity between the source eigenvectors and the target subspace. We show an equivalence between this metric and the variance of target data when projected onto source eigenvectors. Using this equivalence, we select a subset of source principal directions that capture the variance in target data. To define our model, we augment the selected source subspace with the target subspace learned from a handful of target examples. In experiments done on six publicly available datasets, we show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of the RMS fitting error as well as the percentage of test examples for which AAM fitting converges to the ground truth.\n",
      "Deep Reinforcement Learning has been able to achieve amazing successes in a variety of domains from video games to continuous control by trying to maximize the cumulative reward. However, most of these successes rely on algorithms that require a large amount of data to train in order to obtain results on par with human-level performance. This is not feasible if we are to deploy these systems on real world tasks and hence there has been an increased thrust in exploring data efficient algorithms. To this end, we propose the Shared Learning framework aimed at making $Q$-ensemble algorithms data-efficient. For achieving this, we look into some principles of transfer learning which aim to study the benefits of information exchange across tasks in reinforcement learning and adapt transfer to learning our value function estimates in a novel manner. In this paper, we consider the special case of transfer between the value function estimates in the $Q$-ensemble architecture of BootstrappedDQN. We further empirically demonstrate how our proposed framework can help in speeding up the learning process in $Q$-ensembles with minimum computational overhead on a suite of Atari 2600 Games.\n",
      "In this paper, we present a transfer learning approach for music classification and regression tasks. We propose to use a pre-trained convnet feature, a concatenated feature vector using the activations of feature maps of multiple layers in a trained convolutional network. We show how this convnet feature can serve as general-purpose music representation. In the experiments, a convnet is trained for music tagging and then transferred to other music-related classification and regression tasks. The convnet feature outperforms the baseline MFCC feature in all the considered tasks and several previous approaches that are aggregating MFCCs as well as low- and high-level music features.\n",
      "Deep neural networks require a large amount of labeled training data during supervised learning. However, collecting and labeling so much data might be infeasible in many cases. In this paper, we introduce a source-target selective joint fine-tuning scheme for improving the performance of deep learning tasks with insufficient training data. In this scheme, a target learning task with insufficient training data is carried out simultaneously with another source learning task with abundant training data. However, the source learning task does not use all existing training data. Our core idea is to identify and use a subset of training images from the original source learning task whose low-level characteristics are similar to those from the target learning task, and jointly fine-tune shared convolutional layers for both tasks. Specifically, we compute descriptors from linear or nonlinear filter bank responses on training images from both tasks, and use such descriptors to search for a desired subset of training samples for the source learning task.   Experiments demonstrate that our selective joint fine-tuning scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual classification tasks with insufficient training data for deep learning. Such tasks include Caltech 256, MIT Indoor 67, Oxford Flowers 102 and Stanford Dogs 120. In comparison to fine-tuning without a source domain, the proposed method can improve the classification accuracy by 2% - 10% using a single model.\n"

      "The tremendous success of ImageNet-trained deep features on a wide range of transfer tasks begs the question: what are the properties of the ImageNet dataset that are critical for learning good, general-purpose features? This work provides an empirical investigation of various facets of this question: Is more pre-training data always better? How does feature quality depend on the number of training examples per class? Does adding more object classes improve performance? For the same data budget, how should the data be split into classes? Is fine-grained recognition necessary for learning good features? Given the same number of training classes, is it better to have coarse classes or fine-grained classes? Which is better: more classes or more examples per class? To answer these and related questions, we pre-trained CNN features on various subsets of the ImageNet dataset and evaluated transfer performance on PASCAL detection, PASCAL action classification, and SUN scene classification tasks. Our overall findings suggest that most changes in the choice of pre-training data long thought to be critical do not significantly affect transfer performance.? Given the same number of training classes, is it better to have coarse classes or fine-grained classes? Which is better: more classes or more examples per class?\n",
      "Due to physiological variation, patients diagnosed with the same condition may exhibit divergent, but related, responses to the same treatments. Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Processes (HiP-MDPs) tackle this transfer-learning problem by embedding these tasks into a low-dimensional space. However, the original formulation of HiP-MDP had a critical flaw: the embedding uncertainty was modeled independently of the agent's state uncertainty, requiring an unnatural training procedure in which all tasks visited every part of the state space---possible for robots that can be moved to a particular location, impossible for human patients. We update the HiP-MDP framework and extend it to more robustly develop personalized medicine strategies for HIV treatment.\n",
      "In recent years, deep architectures have been used for transfer learning with state-of-the-art performance in many datasets. The properties of their features remain, however, largely unstudied under the transfer perspective. In this work, we present an extensive analysis of the resiliency of feature vectors extracted from deep models, with special focus on the trade-off between performance and compression rate. By introducing perturbations to image descriptions extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, we change their precision and number of dimensions, measuring how it affects the final score. We show that deep features are more robust to these disturbances when compared to classical approaches, achieving a compression rate of 98.4%, while losing only 0.88% of their original score for Pascal VOC 2007.\n",
      "We propose Anticipative Video Transformer (AVT), an end-to-end attention-based video modeling architecture that attends to the previously observed video in order to anticipate future actions. We train the model jointly to predict the next action in a video sequence, while also learning frame feature encoders that are predictive of successive future frames' features. Compared to existing temporal aggregation strategies, AVT has the advantage of both maintaining the sequential progression of observed actions while still capturing long-range dependencies--both critical for the anticipation task. Through extensive experiments, we show that AVT obtains the best reported performance on four popular action anticipation benchmarks: EpicKitchens-55, EpicKitchens-100, EGTEA Gaze+, and 50-Salads; and it wins first place in the EpicKitchens-100 CVPR'21 challenge.\n",
      "In safety-critical machine learning applications, it is crucial to defend models against adversarial attacks -- small modifications of the input that change the predictions. Besides rigorously studied $\\ell_p$-bounded additive perturbations, recently proposed semantic perturbations (e.g. rotation, translation) raise a serious concern on deploying ML systems in real-world. Therefore, it is important to provide provable guarantees for deep learning models against semantically meaningful input transformations. In this paper, we propose a new universal probabilistic certification approach based on Chernoff-Cramer bounds that can be used in general attack settings. We estimate the probability of a model to fail if the attack is sampled from a certain distribution. Our theoretical findings are supported by experimental results on different datasets.\n",
      "Although video summarization has achieved tremendous success benefiting from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), RNN-based methods neglect the global dependencies and multi-hop relationships among video frames, which limits the performance. Transformer is an effective model to deal with this problem, and surpasses RNN-based methods in several sequence modeling tasks, such as machine translation, video captioning, \\emph{etc}. Motivated by the great success of transformer and the natural structure of video (frame-shot-video), a hierarchical transformer is developed for video summarization, which can capture the dependencies among frame and shots, and summarize the video by exploiting the scene information formed by shots. Furthermore, we argue that both the audio and visual information are essential for the video summarization task. To integrate the two kinds of information, they are encoded in a two-stream scheme, and a multimodal fusion mechanism is developed based on the hierarchical transformer. In this paper, the proposed method is denoted as Hierarchical Multimodal Transformer (HMT). Practically, extensive experiments show that HMT surpasses most of the traditional, RNN-based and attention-based video summarization methods.\n",

      "This paper presents a novel Transformer-based facial landmark localization network named Localization Transformer (LOTR). The proposed framework is a direct coordinate regression approach leveraging a Transformer network to better utilize the spatial information in the feature map. An LOTR model consists of three main modules: 1) a visual backbone that converts an input image into a feature map, 2) a Transformer module that improves the feature representation from the visual backbone, and 3) a landmark prediction head that directly predicts the landmark coordinates from the Transformer's representation. Given cropped-and-aligned face images, the proposed LOTR can be trained end-to-end without requiring any post-processing steps. This paper also introduces the smooth-Wing loss function, which addresses the gradient discontinuity of the Wing loss, leading to better convergence than standard loss functions such as L1, L2, and Wing loss. Experimental results on the JD landmark dataset provided by the First Grand Challenge of 106-Point Facial Landmark Localization indicate the superiority of LOTR over the existing methods on the leaderboard and two recent heatmap-based approaches.\n",

Within this latter framework, the present paper illustrates how a deep learning method, exploiting videos of radar reflectivity frames as input, can be used to realize a warning machine able to sound timely alarms of possible severe thunderstorm events. From a technical viewpoint, the computational core of this approach is the use of a value-weighted skill score for both transforming the probabilistic outcomes of the deep neural network into binary classification and assessing the forecasting performances. The warning machine has been validated against weather radar data recorded in the Liguria region, in Italy,\n",
      "Personality computing has become an emerging topic in computer vision, due to the wide range of applications it can be used for. However, most works on the topic have focused on analyzing the individual, even when applied to interaction scenarios, and for short periods of time. To address these limitations, we present the Dyadformer, a novel multi-modal multi-subject Transformer architecture to model individual and interpersonal features in dyadic interactions using variable time windows, thus allowing the capture of long-term interdependencies. Our proposed cross-subject layer allows the network to explicitly model interactions among subjects through attentional operations. This proof-of-concept approach shows how multi-modality and joint modeling of both interactants for longer periods of time helps to predict individual attributes. With Dyadformer, we improve state-of-the-art self-reported personality inference results on individual subjects on the UDIVA v0.5 dataset.\n",
      "Capsule networks use routing algorithms to flow information between consecutive layers. In the existing routing procedures, capsules produce predictions (termed votes) for capsules of the next layer. In a nutshell, the next-layer capsule's input is a weighted sum over all the votes it receives. In this paper, we propose non-iterative cluster routing for capsule networks. In the proposed cluster routing, capsules produce vote clusters instead of individual votes for next-layer capsules, and each vote cluster sends its centroid to a next-layer capsule. Generally speaking, the next-layer capsule's input is a weighted sum over the centroid of each vote cluster it receives. The centroid that comes from a cluster with a smaller variance is assigned a larger weight in the weighted sum process. Compared with the state-of-the-art capsule networks, the proposed capsule networks achieve the best accuracy on the Fashion-MNIST and SVHN datasets with fewer parameters, and achieve the best accuracy on the smallNORB and CIFAR-10 datasets with a moderate number of parameters. The proposed capsule networks also produce capsules with disentangled representation and generalize well to images captured at novel viewpoints. The proposed capsule networks also preserve 2D spatial information of an input image in the capsule channels: if the capsule channels are rotated, the object reconstructed from these channels will be rotated by the same transformation. Codes are available at https://github.com/ZHAOZHIHAO/ClusterRouting.\n",
      "Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a series of computer vision tasks, yet they still suffer from adversarial examples. In this paper, we posit that adversarial attacks on transformers should be specially tailored for their architecture, jointly considering both patches and self-attention, in order to achieve high transferability. More specifically, we introduce a dual attack framework, which contains a Pay No Attention (PNA) attack and a PatchOut attack, to improve the transferability of adversarial samples across different ViTs. We show that skipping the gradients of attention during backpropagation can generate adversarial examples with high transferability. In addition, adversarial perturbations generated by optimizing randomly sampled subsets of patches at each iteration achieve higher attack success rates than attacks using all patches. We evaluate the transferability of attacks on state-of-the-art ViTs, CNNs and robustly trained CNNs. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual attack can greatly boost transferability between ViTs and from ViTs to CNNs. In addition, the proposed method can easily be combined with existing transfer methods to boost performance.\n",
      "Recently, Space-Time Memory Network (STM) based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS). A crucial problem in this task is how to model the dependency both among different frames and inside every frame. However, most of these methods neglect the spatial relationships (inside each frame) and do not make full use of the temporal relationships (among different frames). In this paper, we propose a new transformer-based framework, termed TransVOS, introducing a vision transformer to fully exploit and model both the temporal and spatial relationships. Moreover, most STM-based approaches employ two separate encoders to extract features of two significant inputs, i.e., reference sets (history frames with predicted masks) and query frame (current frame), respectively, increasing the models' parameters and complexity. To slim the popular two-encoder pipeline while keeping the effectiveness, we design a single two-path feature extractor to encode the above two inputs in a unified way. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our TransVOS over state-of-the-art methods on both DAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets.\n",
      "Large Transformer models have been central to recent advances in natural language processing. The training and inference costs of these models, however, have grown rapidly and become prohibitively expensive. Here we aim to reduce the costs of Transformers by searching for a more efficient variant. Compared to previous approaches, our search is performed at a lower level, over the primitives that define a Transformer TensorFlow program. We identify an architecture, named Primer, that has a smaller training cost than the original Transformer and other variants for auto-regressive language modeling. Primer's improvements can be mostly attributed to two simple modifications: squaring ReLU activations and adding a depthwise convolution layer after each Q, K, and V projection in self-attention.   Experiments show Primer's gains over Transformer increase as compute scale grows and follow a power law with respect to quality at optimal model sizes. We also verify empirically that Primer can be dropped into different codebases to significantly speed up training without additional tuning. For example, at a 500M parameter size, Primer improves the original T5 architecture on C4 auto-regressive language modeling, reducing the training cost by 4X. Furthermore, the reduced training cost means Primer needs much less compute to reach a target one-shot performance. For instance, in a 1.9B parameter configuration similar to GPT-3 XL, Primer uses 1/3 of the training compute to achieve the same one-shot performance as Transformer. We open source our models and several comparisons in T5 to help with reproducibility.\n",
      "Automatic transcription of scene understanding in images and videos is a step towards artificial general intelligence. Image captioning is a nomenclature for describing meaningful information in an image using computer vision techniques. Automated image captioning techniques utilize encoder and decoder architecture, where the encoder extracts features from an image and the decoder generates a transcript. In this work, we investigate two unexplored ideas for image captioning using transformers: First, we demonstrate the enforcement of using objects' relevance in the surrounding environment. Second, learning an explicit association between labels and language constructs. We propose label-attention Transformer with geometrically coherent objects (LATGeO). The proposed technique acquires a proposal of geometrically coherent objects using a deep neural network (DNN) and generates captions by investigating their relationships using a label-attention module. Object coherence is defined using the localized ratio of the geometrical properties of the proposals. The label-attention module associates the extracted objects classes to the available dictionary using self-attention layers. The experimentation results show that objects' relevance in surroundings and binding of their visual feature with their geometrically localized ratios combined with its associated labels help in defining meaningful captions. The proposed framework is tested on the MSCOCO dataset, and a thorough evaluation resulting in overall better quantitative scores pronounces its superiority.\n",
      "Machine learning (ML) has made incredible impacts and transformations in a wide range of vehicular applications. As the use of ML in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) continues to advance, adversarial threats and their impact have become an important subject of research worth exploring. In this paper, we focus on Sybil-based adversarial threats against a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-assisted IoV framework and more specifically, DRL-based dynamic service placement in IoV. We carry out an experimental study with real vehicle trajectories to analyze the impact on service delay and resource congestion under different attack scenarios for the DRL-based dynamic service placement application. We further investigate the impact of the proportion of Sybil-attacked vehicles in the network. The results demonstrate that the performance is significantly affected by Sybil-based data poisoning attacks when compared to adversary-free healthy network scenario.\n",
      "We present an empirical study of scaling properties of encoder-decoder Transformer models used in neural machine translation (NMT). We show that cross-entropy loss as a function of model size follows a certain scaling law. Specifically (i) We propose a formula which describes the scaling behavior of cross-entropy loss as a bivariate function of encoder and decoder size, and show that it gives accurate predictions under a variety of scaling approaches and languages; we show that the total number of parameters alone is not sufficient for such purposes. (ii) We observe different power law exponents when scaling the decoder vs scaling the encoder, and provide recommendations for optimal allocation of encoder/decoder capacity based on this observation. (iii) We also report that the scaling behavior of the model is acutely influenced by composition bias of the train/test sets, which we define as any deviation from naturally generated text (either via machine generated or human translated text). We observe that natural text on the target side enjoys scaling, which manifests as successful reduction of the cross-entropy loss. (iv) Finally, we investigate the relationship between the cross-entropy loss and the quality of the generated translations. We find two different behaviors, depending on the nature of the test data. For test sets which were originally translated from target language to source language, both loss and BLEU score improve as model size increases. In contrast, for test sets originally translated from source language to target language, the loss improves, but the BLEU score stops improving after a certain threshold. We release generated text from all models used in this study.\n",
      "Time series models with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can have high accuracy but are unfortunately difficult to interpret as a result of feature-interactions, temporal-interactions, and non-linear transformations. Interpretability is important in domains like healthcare where constructing models that provide insight into the relationships they have learned are required to validate and trust model predictions. We want accurate time series models where users can understand the contribution of individual input features. We present the Interpretable-RNN (I-RNN) that balances model complexity and accuracy by forcing the relationship between variables in the model to be additive. Interactions are restricted between hidden states of the RNN and additively combined at the final step. I-RNN specifically captures the unique characteristics of clinical time series, which are unevenly sampled in time, asynchronously acquired, and have missing data. Importantly, the hidden state activations represent feature coefficients that correlate with the prediction target and can be visualized as risk curves that capture the global relationship between individual input features and the outcome. We evaluate the I-RNN model on the Physionet 2012 Challenge dataset to predict in-hospital mortality, and on a real-world clinical decision support task: predicting hemodynamic interventions in the intensive care unit. I-RNN provides explanations in the form of global and local feature importances comparable to highly intelligible models like decision trees trained on hand-engineered features while significantly outperforming them. I-RNN remains intelligible while providing accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art decay-based and interpolation-based recurrent time series models. The experimental results on real-world clinical datasets refute the myth that there is a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability.\n",
      "Driving in a complex urban environment is a difficult task that requires a complex decision policy. In order to make informed decisions, one needs to gain an understanding of the long-range context and the importance of other vehicles. In this work, we propose to use Vision Transformer (ViT) to learn a driving policy in urban settings with birds-eye-view (BEV) input images. The ViT network learns the global context of the scene more effectively than with earlier proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). Furthermore, ViT's attention mechanism helps to learn an attention map for the scene which allows the ego car to determine which surrounding cars are important to its next decision. We demonstrate that a DQN agent with a ViT backbone outperforms baseline algorithms with ConvNet backbones pre-trained in various ways. In particular, the proposed method helps reinforcement learning algorithms to learn faster, with increased performance and less data than baselines.\n",
      "We propose a novel visual memory network architecture for the learning and inference problem in the spatial-temporal domain. Different from the popular transformers, we maintain a fixed set of memory slots in our memory network and explore designs to input new information into the memory, combine the information in different memory slots and decide when to discard old memory slots. Finally, this architecture is benchmarked on the video object segmentation and video prediction problems. Through the experiments, we show that our memory architecture can achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art while maintaining constant memory capacity.\n",
      "Temperature field reconstruction of heat source systems (TFR-HSS) with limited monitoring sensors occurred in thermal management plays an important role in real time health detection system of electronic equipment in engineering. However, prior methods with common interpolations usually cannot provide accurate reconstruction performance as required. In addition, there exists no public dataset for widely research of reconstruction methods to further boost the reconstruction performance and engineering applications. To overcome this problem, this work develops a machine learning modelling benchmark for TFR-HSS task. First, the TFR-HSS task is mathematically modelled from real-world engineering problem and four types of numerically modellings have been constructed to transform the problem into discrete mapping forms. Then, this work proposes a set of machine learning modelling methods, including the general machine learning methods and the deep learning methods, to advance the state-of-the-art methods over temperature field reconstruction. More importantly, this work develops a novel benchmark dataset, namely Temperature Field Reconstruction Dataset (TFRD), to evaluate these machine learning modelling methods for the TFR-HSS task. Finally, a performance analysis of typical methods is given on TFRD, which can be served as the baseline results on this benchmark.\n",
      "This work introduces a neuro-symbolic agent that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with temporal logic (TL) to achieve systematic zero-shot, i.e., never-seen-before, generalisation of formally specified instructions. In particular, we present a neuro-symbolic framework where a symbolic module transforms TL specifications into a form that helps the training of a DRL agent targeting generalisation, while a neural module learns systematically to solve the given tasks. We study the emergence of systematic learning in different settings and find that the architecture of the convolutional layers is key when generalising to new instructions. We also provide evidence that systematic learning can emerge with abstract operators such as negation when learning from a few training examples, which previous research have struggled with.\n",
      "Different from visible cameras which record intensity images frame by frame, the biologically inspired event camera produces a stream of asynchronous and sparse events with much lower latency. In practice, the visible cameras can better perceive texture details and slow motion, while event cameras can be free from motion blurs and have a larger dynamic range which enables them to work well under fast motion and low illumination. Therefore, the two sensors can cooperate with each other to achieve more reliable object tracking. In this work, we propose a large-scale Visible-Event benchmark (termed VisEvent) due to the lack of a realistic and scaled dataset for this task. Our dataset consists of 820 video pairs captured under low illumination, high speed, and background clutter scenarios, and it is divided into a training and a testing subset, each of which contains 500 and 320 videos, respectively. Based on VisEvent, we transform the event flows into event images and construct more than 30 baseline methods by extending current single-modality trackers into dual-modality versions. More importantly, we further build a simple but effective tracking algorithm by proposing a cross-modality transformer, to achieve more effective feature fusion between visible and event data. Extensive experiments on the proposed VisEvent dataset, FE108, and two simulated datasets (i.e., OTB-DVS and VOT-DVS), validated the effectiveness of our model. The dataset and source code have been released at our project page: \\url{https://sites.google.com/view/viseventtrack/}.\n",
      "Estimating the articulated 3D hand-object pose from a single RGB image is a highly ambiguous and challenging problem requiring large-scale datasets that contain diverse hand poses, object poses, and camera viewpoints. Most real-world datasets lack this diversity. In contrast, synthetic datasets can easily ensure vast diversity, but learning from them is inefficient and suffers from heavy training consumption. To address the above issues, we propose ArtiBoost, a lightweight online data enrichment method that boosts articulated hand-object pose estimation from the data perspective. ArtiBoost is employed along with a real-world source dataset. During training, ArtiBoost alternatively performs data exploration and synthesis. ArtiBoost can cover various hand-object poses and camera viewpoints based on a Compositional hand-object Configuration and Viewpoint space (CCV-space) and can adaptively enrich the current hard-discernable samples by a mining strategy. We apply ArtiBoost on a simple learning baseline network and demonstrate the performance boost on several hand-object benchmarks. As an illustrative example, with ArtiBoost, even a simple baseline network can outperform the previous start-of-the-art based on Transformer on the HO3D dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/ArtiBoost.\n",
      "Scene graphs are nodes and edges consisting of objects and object-object relationships, respectively. Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to identify the objects and their relationships. We propose a bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) transformer network (BGT-Net) for the scene graph generation for images. This model implements novel object-object communication to enhance the object information using a BiGRU layer. Thus, the information of all objects in the image is available for the other objects, which can be leveraged later in the object prediction step. This object information is used in a transformer encoder to predict the object class as well as to create object-specific edge information via the use of another transformer encoder. To handle the dataset bias induced by the long-tailed relationship distribution, softening with a log-softmax function and adding a bias adaptation term to regulate the bias for every relation prediction individually showed to be an effective approach. We conducted an elaborate study on experiments and ablations using open-source datasets, i.e., Visual Genome, Open-Images, and Visual Relationship Detection datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model over state of the art.\n",
      "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) achieve promising performance for skeleton-based action recognition. However, in most GCN-based methods, the spatial-temporal graph convolution is strictly restricted by the graph topology while only captures the short-term temporal context, thus lacking the flexibility of feature extraction. In this work, we present a novel architecture, named Graph Convolutional skeleton Transformer (GCsT), which addresses limitations in GCNs by introducing Transformer. Our GCsT employs all the benefits of Transformer (i.e. dynamical attention and global context) while keeps the advantages of GCNs (i.e. hierarchy and local topology structure). In GCsT, the spatial-temporal GCN forces the capture of local dependencies while Transformer dynamically extracts global spatial-temporal relationships. Furthermore, the proposed GCsT shows stronger expressive capability by adding additional information present in skeleton sequences. Incorporating the Transformer allows that information to be introduced into the model almost effortlessly. We validate the proposed GCsT by conducting extensive experiments, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLA datasets.\n",
      "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse conditional computation has been proved an effective architecture for scaling attention-based models to more parameters with comparable computation cost. In this paper, we propose Sparse-MLP, scaling the recent MLP-Mixer model with sparse MoE layers, to achieve a more computation-efficient architecture. We replace a subset of dense MLP blocks in the MLP-Mixer model with Sparse blocks. In each Sparse block, we apply two stages of MoE layers: one with MLP experts mixing information within channels along image patch dimension, one with MLP experts mixing information within patches along the channel dimension. Besides, to reduce computational cost in routing and improve expert capacity, we design Re-represent layers in each Sparse block. These layers are to re-scale image representations by two simple but effective linear transformations. When pre-training on ImageNet-1k with MoCo v3 algorithm, our models can outperform dense MLP models by 2.5\\% on ImageNet Top-1 accuracy with fewer parameters and computational cost. On small-scale downstream image classification tasks, i.e. Cifar10 and Cifar100, our Sparse-MLP can still achieve better performance than baselines.\n",
      "Visual correspondence is a fundamental building block on the way to building assistive tools for hand-drawn animation. However, while a large body of work has focused on learning visual correspondences at the pixel-level, few approaches have emerged to learn correspondence at the level of line enclosures (segments) that naturally occur in hand-drawn animation. Exploiting this structure in animation has numerous benefits: it avoids the intractable memory complexity of attending to individual pixels in high resolution images and enables the use of real-world animation datasets that contain correspondence information at the level of per-segment colors. To that end, we propose the Animation Transformer (AnT) which uses a transformer-based architecture to learn the spatial and visual relationships between segments across a sequence of images. AnT enables practical ML-assisted colorization for professional animation workflows and is publicly accessible as a creative tool in Cadmium.\n",
      "The data scarcity problem in Electroencephalography (EEG) based affective computing results into difficulty in building an effective model with high accuracy and stability using machine learning algorithms especially deep learning models. Data augmentation has recently achieved considerable performance improvement for deep learning models: increased accuracy, stability, and reduced over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation framework, namely Generative Adversarial Network-based Self-supervised Data Augmentation (GANSER). As the first to combine adversarial training with self-supervised learning for EEG-based emotion recognition, the proposed framework can generate high-quality and high-diversity simulated EEG samples. In particular, we utilize adversarial training to learn an EEG generator and force the generated EEG signals to approximate the distribution of real samples, ensuring the quality of augmented samples. A transformation function is employed to mask parts of EEG signals and force the generator to synthesize potential EEG signals based on the remaining parts, to produce a wide variety of samples. The masking possibility during transformation is introduced as prior knowledge to guide to extract distinguishable features for simulated EEG signals and generalize the classifier to the augmented sample space. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method can help emotion recognition for performance gain and achieve state-of-the-art results.\n",
      "We focus on building robustness in the convolutions of neural visual classifiers, especially against natural perturbations like elastic deformations, occlusions and Gaussian noise. Existing CNNs show outstanding performance on clean images, but fail to tackle naturally occurring perturbations. In this paper, we start from elastic perturbations, which approximate (local) view-point changes of the object. We present elastically-augmented convolutions (EAConv) by parameterizing filters as a combination of fixed elastically-perturbed bases functions and trainable weights for the purpose of integrating unseen viewpoints in the CNN. We show on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets that the general robustness of our method on unseen occlusion, zoom, rotation, image cut and Gaussian perturbations improves, while significantly improving the performance on clean images without any data augmentation.\n",
      "Sequential diagnosis prediction on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) has been proven crucial for predictive analytics in the medical domain. EHR data, sequential records of a patient's interactions with healthcare systems, has numerous inherent characteristics of temporality, irregularity and data insufficiency. Some recent works train healthcare predictive models by making use of sequential information in EHR data, but they are vulnerable to irregular, temporal EHR data with the states of admission/discharge from hospital, and insufficient data. To mitigate this, we propose an end-to-end robust transformer-based model called SETOR, which exploits neural ordinary differential equation to handle both irregular intervals between a patient's visits with admitted timestamps and length of stay in each visit, to alleviate the limitation of insufficient data by integrating medical ontology, and to capture the dependencies between the patient's visits by employing multi-layer transformer blocks. Experiments conducted on two real-world healthcare datasets show that, our sequential diagnoses prediction model SETOR not only achieves better predictive results than previous state-of-the-art approaches, irrespective of sufficient or insufficient training data, but also derives more interpretable embeddings of medical codes. The experimental codes are available at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Xueping/SETOR).\n",
      "More transformer blocks with residual connections have recently achieved impressive results on various tasks. To achieve better performance with fewer trainable parameters, recent methods are proposed to go shallower by parameter sharing or model compressing along with the depth. However, weak modeling capacity limits their performance. Contrastively, going wider by inducing more trainable matrixes and parameters would produce a huge model requiring advanced parallelism to train and inference.   In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient framework, going wider instead of deeper. Specially, following existing works, we adapt parameter sharing to compress along depth. But, such deployment would limit the performance. To maximize modeling capacity, we scale along model width by replacing feed-forward network (FFN) with mixture-of-experts (MoE). Across transformer blocks, instead of sharing normalization layers, we propose to use individual layernorms to transform various semantic representations in a more parameter-efficient way. To evaluate our plug-and-run framework, we design WideNet and conduct comprehensive experiments on popular computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, our best model outperforms Vision Transformer (ViT) by $1.5\\%$ with $0.72 \\times$ trainable parameters. Using $0.46 \\times$ and $0.13 \\times$ parameters, our WideNet can still surpass ViT and ViT-MoE by $0.8\\%$ and $2.1\\%$, respectively. On four natural language processing datasets, WideNet outperforms ALBERT by $1.8\\%$ on average and surpass BERT using factorized embedding parameterization by $0.8\\%$ with fewer parameters.\n",

The transformer architecture proves amenable to training on solved text archives describing mazes, Rubik's Cube, and Sudoku solvers. The method benefits from fine-tuning the transformer architecture to visualize plausible strategies derived outside any guidance from human heuristics or domain expertise. The large search space ($>10^{19}$) for the games provides a puzzle environment in which the solution has few intermediate rewards and a final move that solves the challenge.\n",
      "Existing road pothole detection approaches can be classified as computer vision-based or machine learning-based. The former approaches typically employ 2-D image analysis/understanding or 3-D point cloud modeling and segmentation algorithms to detect road potholes from vision sensor data. The latter approaches generally address road pothole detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end manner. However, road potholes are not necessarily ubiquitous and it is challenging to prepare a large well-annotated dataset for CNN training. In this regard, while computer vision-based methods were the mainstream research trend in the past decade, machine learning-based methods were merely discussed. Recently, we published the first stereo vision-based road pothole detection dataset and a novel disparity transformation algorithm, whereby the damaged and undamaged road areas can be highly distinguished. However, there are no benchmarks currently available for state-of-the-art (SoTA) CNNs trained using either disparity images or transformed disparity images. Therefore, in this paper, we first discuss the SoTA CNNs designed for semantic segmentation and evaluate their performance for road pothole detection with extensive experiments. Additionally, inspired by graph neural network (GNN), we propose a novel CNN layer, referred to as graph attention layer (GAL), which can be easily deployed in any existing CNN to optimize image feature representations for semantic segmentation. Our experiments compare GAL-DeepLabv3+, our best-performing implementation, with nine SoTA CNNs on three modalities of training data: RGB images, disparity images, and transformed disparity images. The experimental results suggest that our proposed GAL-DeepLabv3+ achieves the best overall pothole detection accuracy on all training data modalities.\n",
      "We propose a Transformer-based framework for 3D human texture estimation from a single image. The proposed Transformer is able to effectively exploit the global information of the input image, overcoming the limitations of existing methods that are solely based on convolutional neural networks. In addition, we also propose a mask-fusion strategy to combine the advantages of the RGB-based and texture-flow-based models. We further introduce a part-style loss to help reconstruct high-fidelity colors without introducing unpleasant artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against state-of-the-art 3D human texture estimation approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n",
      "Recently, many datasets have been proposed to test the systematic generalization ability of neural networks. The companion baseline Transformers, typically trained with default hyper-parameters from standard tasks, are shown to fail dramatically. Here we demonstrate that by revisiting model configurations as basic as scaling of embeddings, early stopping, relative positional embedding, and Universal Transformer variants, we can drastically improve the performance of Transformers on systematic generalization. We report improvements on five popular datasets: SCAN, CFQ, PCFG, COGS, and Mathematics dataset. Our models improve accuracy from 50% to 85% on the PCFG productivity split, and from 35% to 81% on COGS. On SCAN, relative positional embedding largely mitigates the EOS decision problem (Newman et al., 2020), yielding 100% accuracy on the length split with a cutoff at 26. Importantly, performance differences between these models are typically invisible on the IID data split. This calls for proper generalization validation sets for developing neural networks that generalize systematically. We publicly release the code to reproduce our results.\n",
      "In deep neural networks, better results can often be obtained by increasing the complexity of previously developed basic models. However, it is unclear whether there is a way to boost performance by decreasing the complexity of such models. Here, based on an optimization method, we investigate the feasibility of improving graph classification performance while simplifying the model learning process. Inspired by progress in structural information assessment, we optimize the given data sample from graphs to encoding trees. In particular, we minimize the structural entropy of the transformed encoding tree to decode the key structure underlying a graph. This transformation is denoted as structural optimization. Furthermore, we propose a novel feature combination scheme, termed hierarchical reporting, for encoding trees. In this scheme, features are transferred from leaf nodes to root nodes by following the hierarchical structures of encoding trees. We then present an implementation of the scheme in a tree kernel and a convolutional network to perform graph classification. The tree kernel follows label propagation in the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree kernel, but it has a lower runtime complexity $O(n)$. The convolutional network is a special implementation of our tree kernel in the deep learning field and is called Encoding Tree Learning (ETL). We empirically validate our tree kernel and convolutional network with several graph classification benchmarks and demonstrate that our methods achieve better performance and lower computational consumption than competing approaches.\n",
      "Content and style (C-S) disentanglement intends to decompose the underlying explanatory factors of objects into two independent subspaces. From the unsupervised disentanglement perspective, we rethink content and style and propose a formulation for unsupervised C-S disentanglement based on our assumption that different factors are of different importance and popularity for image reconstruction, which serves as a data bias. The corresponding model inductive bias is introduced by our proposed C-S disentanglement Module (C-S DisMo), which assigns different and independent roles to content and style when approximating the real data distributions. Specifically, each content embedding from the dataset, which encodes the most dominant factors for image reconstruction, is assumed to be sampled from a shared distribution across the dataset. The style embedding for a particular image, encoding the remaining factors, is used to customize the shared distribution through an affine transformation. The experiments on several popular datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art unsupervised C-S disentanglement, which is comparable or even better than supervised methods. We verify the effectiveness of our method by downstream tasks: domain translation and single-view 3D reconstruction. Project page at https://github.com/xrenaa/CS-DisMo.\n",
      "The automatic verification of document authorships is important in various settings. Researchers are for example judged and compared by the amount and impact of their publications and public figures are confronted by their posts on social media platforms. Therefore, it is important that authorship information in frequently used web services and platforms is correct. The question whether a given document is written by a given author is commonly referred to as authorship verification (AV). While AV is a widely investigated problem in general, only few works consider settings where the documents are short and written in a rather uniform style. This makes most approaches unpractical for online databases and knowledge graphs in the scholarly domain. Here, authorships of scientific publications have to be verified, often with just abstracts and titles available. To this point, we present our novel approach LG4AV which combines language models and graph neural networks for authorship verification. By directly feeding the available texts in a pre-trained transformer architecture, our model does not need any hand-crafted stylometric features that are not meaningful in scenarios where the writing style is, at least to some extent, standardized. By the incorporation of a graph neural network structure, our model can benefit from relations between authors that are meaningful with respect to the verification process. For example, scientific authors are more likely to write about topics that are addressed by their co-authors and twitter users tend to post about the same subjects as people they follow. We experimentally evaluate our model and study to which extent the inclusion of co-authorships enhances verification decisions in bibliometric environments.\n",
      "In this work we seek to bridge the concepts of topographic organization and equivariance in neural networks. To accomplish this, we introduce the Topographic VAE: a novel method for efficiently training deep generative models with topographically organized latent variables. We show that such a model indeed learns to organize its activations according to salient characteristics such as digit class, width, and style on MNIST. Furthermore, through topographic organization over time (i.e. temporal coherence), we demonstrate how predefined latent space transformation operators can be encouraged for observed transformed input sequences -- a primitive form of unsupervised learned equivariance. We demonstrate that this model successfully learns sets of approximately equivariant features (i.e. \"capsules\") directly from sequences and achieves higher likelihood on correspondingly transforming test sequences. Equivariance is verified quantitatively by measuring the approximate commutativity of the inference network and the sequence transformations. Finally, we demonstrate approximate equivariance to complex transformations, expanding upon the capabilities of existing group equivariant neural networks.\n",
      "There is a warning light for the loss of plant habitats worldwide that entails concerted efforts to conserve plant biodiversity. Thus, plant species classification is of crucial importance to address this environmental challenge. In recent years, there is a considerable increase in the number of studies related to plant taxonomy. While some researchers try to improve their recognition performance using novel approaches, others concentrate on computational optimization for their framework. In addition, a few studies are diving into feature extraction to gain significantly in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we propose an effective method for the leaf recognition problem. In our proposed approach, a leaf goes through some pre-processing to extract its refined color image, vein image, xy-projection histogram, handcrafted shape, texture features, and Fourier descriptors. These attributes are then transformed into a better representation by neural network-based encoders before a support vector machine (SVM) model is utilized to classify different leaves. Overall, our approach performs a state-of-the-art result on the Flavia leaf dataset, achieving the accuracy of 99.58\\% on test sets under random 10-fold cross-validation and bypassing the previous methods. We also release our codes (Scripts are available at https://github.com/dinhvietcuong1996/LeafRecognition) for contributing to the research community in the leaf classification problem.\n",
      "Deep Neural Networks have been shown to be vulnerable to various kinds of adversarial perturbations. In addition to widely studied additive noise based perturbations, adversarial examples can also be created by applying a per pixel spatial drift on input images. While spatial transformation based adversarial examples look more natural to human observers due to absence of additive noise, they still possess visible distortions caused by spatial transformations. Since the human vision is more sensitive to the distortions in the luminance compared to those in chrominance channels, which is one of the main ideas behind the lossy visual multimedia compression standards, we propose a spatial transformation based perturbation method to create adversarial examples by only modifying the color components of an input image. While having competitive fooling rates on CIFAR-10 and NIPS2017 Adversarial Learning Challenge datasets, examples created with the proposed method have better scores with regards to various perceptual quality metrics. Human visual perception studies validate that the examples are more natural looking and often indistinguishable from their original counterparts.\n",
      "Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), the most prominent Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, celebrate much success in the analysis of graph-structured data. Concurrently, the sparsification of Neural Network models attracts a great amount of academic and industrial interest. In this paper, we conduct a structured study of the effect of sparsification on the trainable part of MPNNs known as the Update step. To this end, we design a series of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update step. Specifically, we propose the ExpanderGNN model with a tuneable sparsification rate and the Activation-Only GNN, which has no linear transform in the Update step. In agreement with a growing trend in the literature, the sparsification paradigm is changed by initialising sparse neural network architectures rather than expensively sparsifying already trained architectures. Our novel benchmark models enable a better understanding of the influence of the Update step on model performance and outperform existing simplified benchmark models such as the Simple Graph Convolution. The ExpanderGNNs, and in some cases the Activation-Only models, achieve performance on par with their vanilla counterparts on several downstream tasks while containing significantly fewer trainable parameters. In experiments with matching parameter numbers, our benchmark models outperform the state-of-the-art GNN models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ChangminWu/ExpanderGNN.\n",
      "The CycleGAN framework allows for unsupervised image-to-image translation of unpaired data. In a scenario of surgical training on a physical surgical simulator, this method can be used to transform endoscopic images of phantoms into images which more closely resemble the intra-operative appearance of the same surgical target structure. This can be viewed as a novel augmented reality approach, which we coined Hyperrealism in previous work. In this use case, it is of paramount importance to display objects like needles, sutures or instruments consistent in both domains while altering the style to a more tissue-like appearance. Segmentation of these objects would allow for a direct transfer, however, contouring of these, partly tiny and thin foreground objects is cumbersome and perhaps inaccurate. Instead, we propose to use landmark detection on the points when sutures pass into the tissue. This objective is directly incorporated into a CycleGAN framework by treating the performance of pre-trained detector models as an additional optimization goal. We show that a task defined on these sparse landmark labels improves consistency of synthesis by the generator network in both domains. Comparing a baseline CycleGAN architecture to our proposed extension (DetCycleGAN), mean precision (PPV) improved by +61.32, mean sensitivity (TPR) by +37.91, and mean F1 score by +0.4743. Furthermore, it could be shown that by dataset fusion, generated intra-operative images can be leveraged as additional training data for the detection network itself.

      "In this paper, we present InSeGAN, an unsupervised 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) for segmenting (nearly) identical instances of rigid objects in depth images. Using an analysis-by-synthesis approach, we design a novel GAN architecture to synthesize a multiple-instance depth image with independent control over each instance. InSeGAN takes in a set of code vectors (e.g., random noise vectors), each encoding the 3D pose of an object that is represented by a learned implicit object template. The generator has two distinct modules. The first module, the instance feature generator, uses each encoded pose to transform the implicit template into a feature map representation of each object instance. The second module, the depth image renderer, aggregates all of the single-instance feature maps output by the first module and generates a multiple-instance depth image. A discriminator distinguishes the generated multiple-instance depth images from the distribution of true depth images. To use our model for instance segmentation, we propose an instance pose encoder that learns to take in a generated depth image and reproduce the pose code vectors for all of the object instances. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, \"Insta-10\", consisting of 100,000 depth images, each with 5 instances of an object from one of 10 classes. Our experiments on Insta-10, as well as on real-world noisy depth images, show that InSeGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, often outperforming prior methods by large margins.\n",
      "Autonomous driving at intersections is one of the most complicated and accident-prone traffic scenarios, especially with mixed traffic participants such as vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. The driving policy should make safe decisions to handle the dynamic traffic conditions and meet the requirements of on-board computation. However, most of the current researches focuses on simplified intersections considering only the surrounding vehicles and idealized traffic lights. This paper improves the integrated decision and control framework and develops a learning-based algorithm to deal with complex intersections with mixed traffic flows, which can not only take account of realistic characteristics of traffic lights, but also learn a safe policy under different safety constraints. We first consider different velocity models for green and red lights in the training process and use a finite state machine to handle different modes of light transformation. Then we design different types of distance constraints for vehicles, traffic lights, pedestrians, bicycles respectively and formulize the constrained optimal control problems (OCPs) to be optimized. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) with value and policy networks is adopted to solve the series of OCPs. In order to verify the safety and efficiency of the proposed method, we design a multi-lane intersection with the existence of large-scale mixed traffic participants and set practical traffic light phases. The simulation results indicate that the trained decision and control policy can well balance safety and tracking performance. Compared with model predictive control (MPC), the computational time is three orders of magnitude lower.\n",
      "We propose a method to create plausible geometric and texture style variations of 3D objects in the quest to democratize 3D content creation. Given a pair of textured source and target objects, our method predicts a part-aware affine transformation field that naturally warps the source shape to imitate the overall geometric style of the target. In addition, the texture style of the target is transferred to the warped source object with the help of a multi-view differentiable renderer. Our model, 3DStyleNet, is composed of two sub-networks trained in two stages. First, the geometric style network is trained on a large set of untextured 3D shapes. Second, we jointly optimize our geometric style network and a pre-trained image style transfer network with losses defined over both the geometry and the rendering of the result. Given a small set of high-quality textured objects, our method can create many novel stylized shapes, resulting in effortless 3D content creation and style-ware data augmentation. We showcase our approach qualitatively on 3D content stylization, and provide user studies to validate the quality of our results. In addition, our method can serve as a valuable tool to create 3D data augmentations for computer vision tasks. Extensive quantitative analysis shows that 3DStyleNet outperforms alternative data augmentation techniques for the downstream task of single-image 3D reconstruction.\n",
      "Time series forecasting is essential for a wide range of real-world applications. Recent studies have shown the superiority of Transformer in dealing with such problems, especially long sequence time series input(LSTI) and long sequence time series forecasting(LSTF) problems. To improve the efficiency and enhance the locality of Transformer, these studies combine Transformer with CNN in varying degrees. However, their combinations are loosely-coupled and do not make full use of CNN. To address this issue, we propose the concept of tightly-coupled convolutional Transformer(TCCT) and three TCCT architectures which apply transformed CNN architectures into Transformer: (1) CSPAttention: through fusing CSPNet with self-attention mechanism, the computation cost of self-attention mechanism is reduced by 30% and the memory usage is reduced by 50% while achieving equivalent or beyond prediction accuracy. (2) Dilated causal convolution: this method is to modify the distilling operation proposed by Informer through replacing canonical convolutional layers with dilated causal convolutional layers to gain exponentially receptive field growth. (3) Passthrough mechanism: the application of passthrough mechanism to stack of self-attention blocks helps Transformer-like models get more fine-grained information with negligible extra computation costs. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that our TCCT architectures could greatly improve the performance of existing state-of-art Transformer models on time series forecasting with much lower computation and memory costs, including canonical Transformer, LogTrans and Informer.\n",
      "The use of multi-modal data such as the combination of whole slide images (WSIs) and gene expression data for survival analysis can lead to more accurate survival predictions. Previous multi-modal survival models are not able to efficiently excavate the intrinsic information within each modality. Moreover, despite experimental results show that WSIs provide more effective information than gene expression data, previous methods regard the information from different modalities as similarly important so they cannot flexibly utilize the potential connection between the modalities. To address the above problems, we propose a new asymmetrical multi-modal method, termed as AMMASurv. Specifically, we design an asymmetrical multi-modal attention mechanism (AMMA) in Transformer encoder for multi-modal data to enable a more flexible multi-modal information fusion for survival prediction. Different from previous works, AMMASurv can effectively utilize the intrinsic information within every modality and flexibly adapts to the modalities of different importance. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Encouraging results demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "The prevalence of relation networks in computer vision is in stark contrast to underexplored point-based methods. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of local relation operators and survey their feasibility. We propose a scalable and efficient module, called group relation aggregator. The module computes a feature of a group based on the aggregation of the features of the inner-group points weighted by geometric relations and semantic relations. We adopt this module to design our RPNet. We further verify the expandability of RPNet, in terms of both depth and width, on the tasks of classification and segmentation. Surprisingly, empirical results show that wider RPNet fits for classification, while deeper RPNet works better on segmentation. RPNet achieves state-of-the-art for classification and segmentation on challenging benchmarks. We also compare our local aggregator with PointNet++, with around 30% parameters and 50% computation saving. Finally, we conduct experiments to reveal the robustness of RPNet with regard to rigid transformation and noises.\n",
      "Interaction and navigation defined by natural language instructions in dynamic environments pose significant challenges for neural agents. This paper focuses on addressing two challenges: handling long sequence of subtasks, and understanding complex human instructions. We propose Episodic Transformer (E.T.), a multimodal transformer that encodes language inputs and the full episode history of visual observations and actions. To improve training, we leverage synthetic instructions as an intermediate representation that decouples understanding the visual appearance of an environment from the variations of natural language instructions. We demonstrate that encoding the history with a transformer is critical to solve compositional tasks, and that pretraining and joint training with synthetic instructions further improve the performance. Our approach sets a new state of the art on the challenging ALFRED benchmark, achieving 38.4% and 8.5% task success rates on seen and unseen test splits.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in learning better representations by performing feature propagation and transformation iteratively to leverage neighborhood information. Nevertheless, iterative propagation restricts the information of higher-layer neighborhoods to be transported through and fused with the lower-layer neighborhoods', which unavoidably results in feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different layers and can thus compromise the performance, especially on heterophily networks. Furthermore, most deep GNNs only recognize the importance of higher-layer neighborhoods while yet to fully explore the importance of multi-hop dependency within the context of different layer neighborhoods in learning better representations. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different layers and empirically demonstrate the variance of the homophily level across neighborhoods at different layers. Motivated by these analyses, we further propose a tree decomposition method to disentangle neighborhoods in different layers to alleviate feature smoothing among these layers. Moreover, we characterize the multi-hop dependency via graph diffusion within our tree decomposition formulation to construct Tree Decomposed Graph Neural Network (TDGNN), which can flexibly incorporate information from large receptive fields and aggregate this information utilizing the multi-hop dependency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of TDGNN on both homophily and heterophily networks under a variety of node classification settings. Extensive parameter analysis highlights the ability of TDGNN to prevent over-smoothing and incorporate features from shallow layers with deeper multi-hop dependencies, which provides new insights towards deeper graph neural networks.

      "In this thesis, we introduce Greenformers, a collection of model efficiency methods to improve the model efficiency of the recently renowned transformer models with a low-rank approximation approach. The development trend of deep learning models tends to results in a more complex and larger model. Although it leads to a better and more accurate prediction, the resulting model becomes even more costly, as it requires weeks of training with a huge amount of GPU resources. Particularly, the size and computational cost of transformer-based models have increased tremendously since its first debut in 2017 from ~100 million parameters up to ~1.6 trillion parameters in early 2021. This computationally hungry model also incurs a substantial cost to the environment and even reaches an alarming level of carbon footprint. Some of these models are so massive that it is even impossible to run the model without a GPU cluster.   Greenformers improve the model efficiency of transformer models by applying low-rank approximation approaches. Specifically, we propose a low-rank factorization approach to improve the efficiency of the transformer model called Low-Rank Transformer. We further compare our model with an existing low-rank factorization approach called Linformer. Based on our analysis, the Low-Rank Transformer model is suitable for improving both the time and memory efficiency in processing short-sequence (<= 512) input data, while the Linformer model is suitable for improving the efficiency in processing long-sequence input data (>= 512). We also show that Low-Rank Transformer is more suitable for on-device deployment, as it significantly reduces the model size. Additionally, we estimate that applying LRT to the existing BERT-base model can significantly reduce the computational, economical, and environmental costs for developing such models by more than 30% of its original costs.\n",
      "Due to the rapid increase in the diversity of image data, the problem of domain generalization has received increased attention recently. While domain generalization is a challenging problem, it has achieved great development thanks to the fast development of AI techniques in computer vision. Most of these advanced algorithms are proposed with deep architectures based on convolution neural nets (CNN). However, though CNNs have a strong ability to find the discriminative features, they do a poor job of modeling the relations between different locations in the image due to the response to CNN filters are mostly local. Since these local and global spatial relationships are characterized to distinguish an object under consideration, they play a critical role in improving the generalization ability against the domain gap. In order to get the object parts relationships to gain better domain generalization, this work proposes to use the self attention model. However, the attention models are proposed for sequence, which are not expert in discriminate feature extraction for 2D images. Considering this, we proposed a hybrid architecture to discover the spatial relationships between these local features, and derive a composite representation that encodes both the discriminative features and their relationships to improve the domain generalization. Evaluation on three well-known benchmarks demonstrates the benefits of modeling relationships between the features of an image using the proposed method and achieves state-of-the-art domain generalization performance. More specifically, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art by $2.2\\%$ and $3.4\\%$ on PACS and Office-Home databases, respectively.\n",
      "The use of deep 3D point cloud models in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, dictates the need to certify the robustness of these models to real-world transformations. This is technically challenging, as it requires a scalable verifier tailored to point cloud models that handles a wide range of semantic 3D transformations. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce 3DCertify, the first verifier able to certify the robustness of point cloud models. 3DCertify is based on two key insights: (i) a generic relaxation based on first-order Taylor approximations, applicable to any differentiable transformation, and (ii) a precise relaxation for global feature pooling, which is more complex than pointwise activations (e.g., ReLU or sigmoid) but commonly employed in point cloud models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DCertify by performing an extensive evaluation on a wide range of 3D transformations (e.g., rotation, twisting) for both classification and part segmentation tasks. For example, we can certify robustness against rotations by $\\pm$60{\\deg} for 95.7% of point clouds, and our max pool relaxation increases certification by up to 15.6%.\n",
      "Manifold learning methods are an invaluable tool in today's world of increasingly huge datasets. Manifold learning algorithms can discover a much lower-dimensional representation (embedding) of a high-dimensional dataset through non-linear transformations that preserve the most important structure of the original data. State-of-the-art manifold learning methods directly optimise an embedding without mapping between the original space and the discovered embedded space. This makes interpretability - a key requirement in exploratory data analysis - nearly impossible. Recently, genetic programming has emerged as a very promising approach to manifold learning by evolving functional mappings from the original space to an embedding. However, genetic programming-based manifold learning has struggled to match the performance of other approaches. In this work, we propose a new approach to using genetic programming for manifold learning, which preserves local topology. This is expected to significantly improve performance on tasks where local neighbourhood structure (topology) is paramount. We compare our proposed approach with various baseline manifold learning methods and find that it often outperforms other methods, including a clear improvement over previous genetic programming approaches. These results are particularly promising, given the potential interpretability and reusability of the evolved mappings.\n",
      "Social media such as Instagram and Twitter have become important platforms for marketing and selling illicit drugs. Detection of online illicit drug trafficking has become critical to combat the online trade of illicit drugs. However, the legal status often varies spatially and temporally; even for the same drug, federal and state legislation can have different regulations about its legality. Meanwhile, more drug trafficking events are disguised as a novel form of advertising commenting leading to information heterogeneity. Accordingly, accurate detection of illicit drug trafficking events (IDTEs) from social media has become even more challenging. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on fine-grained detection of IDTEs on Instagram. We propose to take a deep multimodal multilabel learning (DMML) approach to detect IDTEs and demonstrate its effectiveness on a newly constructed dataset called multimodal IDTE(MM-IDTE). Specifically, our model takes text and image data as the input and combines multimodal information to predict multiple labels of illicit drugs. Inspired by the success of BERT, we have developed a self-supervised multimodal bidirectional transformer by jointly fine-tuning pretrained text and image encoders. We have constructed a large-scale dataset MM-IDTE with manually annotated multiple drug labels to support fine-grained detection of illicit drugs. Extensive experimental results on the MM-IDTE dataset show that the proposed DMML methodology can accurately detect IDTEs even in the presence of special characters and style changes attempting to evade detection.\n",
      "Existing studies on disease diagnostic models focus either on diagnostic model learning for performance improvement or on the visual explanation of a trained diagnostic model. We propose a novel learn-explain-reinforce (LEAR) framework that unifies diagnostic model learning, visual explanation generation (explanation unit), and trained diagnostic model reinforcement (reinforcement unit) guided by the visual explanation. For the visual explanation, we generate a counterfactual map that transforms an input sample to be identified as an intended target label. For example, a counterfactual map can localize hypothetical abnormalities within a normal brain image that may cause it to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We believe that the generated counterfactual maps represent data-driven and model-induced knowledge about a target task, i.e., AD diagnosis using structural MRI, which can be a vital source of information to reinforce the generalization of the trained diagnostic model. To this end, we devise an attention-based feature refinement module with the guidance of the counterfactual maps. The explanation and reinforcement units are reciprocal and can be operated iteratively. Our proposed approach was validated via qualitative and quantitative analysis on the ADNI dataset. Its comprehensibility and fidelity were demonstrated through ablation studies and comparisons with existing methods.\n",
      "The goal of a classification model is to assign the correct labels to data. In most cases, this data is not fully described by the given set of labels. Often a rich set of meaningful concepts exist in the domain that can much more precisely describe each datapoint. Such concepts can also be highly useful for interpreting the model's classifications. In this paper we propose a model, denoted as Variational Autoencoder-based Contrastive Explanation (VAE-CE), that represents data with high-level concepts and uses this representation for both classification and generating explanations. The explanations are produced in a contrastive manner, conveying why a datapoint is assigned to one class rather than an alternative class. An explanation is specified as a set of transformations of the input datapoint, with each step depicting a concept changing towards the contrastive class. We build the model using a disentangled VAE, extended with a new supervised method for disentangling individual dimensions. An analysis on synthetic data and MNIST shows that the approaches to both disentanglement and explanation provide benefits over other methods.\n",
      "Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted much attention with the prevalence of accessible depth sensors. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used for this task due to their powerful capability to model graph data. The topology of the adjacency graph is a key factor for modeling the correlations of the input skeletons. Thus, previous methods mainly focus on the design/learning of the graph topology. But once the topology is learned, only a single-scale feature and one transformation exist in each layer of the networks. Many insights, such as multi-scale information and multiple sets of transformations, that have been proven to be very effective in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have not been investigated in GCNs. The reason is that, due to the gap between graph-structured skeleton data and conventional image/video data, it is very challenging to embed these insights into GCNs. To overcome this gap, we reinvent the split-transform-merge strategy in GCNs for skeleton sequence processing. Specifically, we design a simple and highly modularized graph convolutional network architecture for skeleton-based action recognition. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates multi-granularity information from both the spatial and temporal paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin with only 1/5 of the parameters and 1/10 of the FLOPs.

      "Point clouds captured in real-world applications are often incomplete due to the limited sensor resolution, single viewpoint, and occlusion. Therefore, recovering the complete point clouds from partial ones becomes an indispensable task in many practical applications. In this paper, we present a new method that reformulates point cloud completion as a set-to-set translation problem and design a new model, called PoinTr that adopts a transformer encoder-decoder architecture for point cloud completion. By representing the point cloud as a set of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, we convert the point cloud to a sequence of point proxies and employ the transformers for point cloud generation. To facilitate transformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D geometric structures of point clouds, we further devise a geometry-aware block that models the local geometric relationships explicitly. The migration of transformers enables our model to better learn structural knowledge and preserve detailed information for point cloud completion. Furthermore, we propose two more challenging benchmarks with more diverse incomplete point clouds that can better reflect the real-world scenarios to promote future research. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both the new benchmarks and the existing ones. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxumin/PoinTr\n",
      "Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. In this paper, we cast point cloud registration into a planning problem in reinforcement learning, which can seek the transformation between the source and target point clouds through trial and error. By modeling the point cloud registration process as a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a latent dynamic model of point clouds, consisting of a transformation network and evaluation network. The transformation network aims to predict the new transformed feature of the point cloud after performing a rigid transformation (i.e., action) on it while the evaluation network aims to predict the alignment precision between the transformed source point cloud and target point cloud as the reward signal. Once the dynamic model of the point cloud is trained, we employ the cross-entropy method (CEM) to iteratively update the planning policy by maximizing the rewards in the point cloud registration process. Thus, the optimal policy, i.e., the transformation between the source and target point clouds, can be obtained via gradually narrowing the search space of the transformation. Experimental results on ModelNet40 and 7Scene benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can yield good registration performance in an unsupervised manner.\n",
      "Explainable reinforcement learning allows artificial agents to explain their behavior in a human-like manner aiming at non-expert end-users. An efficient alternative of creating explanations is to use an introspection-based method that transforms Q-values into probabilities of success used as the base to explain the agent's decision-making process. This approach has been effectively used in episodic and discrete scenarios, however, to compute the probability of success in non-episodic and more complex environments has not been addressed yet. In this work, we adapt the introspection method to be used in a non-episodic task and try it in a continuous Atari game scenario solved with the Rainbow algorithm. Our initial results show that the probability of success can be computed directly from the Q-values for all possible actions.\n",
      "Video-Text Retrieval has been a hot research topic with the growth of multimedia data on the internet. Transformer for video-text learning has attracted increasing attention due to its promising performance. However, existing cross-modal transformer approaches typically suffer from two major limitations: 1) Exploitation of the transformer architecture where different layers have different feature characteristics is limited; 2) End-to-end training mechanism limits negative sample interactions in a mini-batch. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Transformer (HiT) for video-text retrieval. HiT performs Hierarchical Cross-modal Contrastive Matching in both feature-level and semantic-level, achieving multi-view and comprehensive retrieval results. Moreover, inspired by MoCo, we propose Momentum Cross-modal Contrast for cross-modal learning to enable large-scale negative sample interactions on-the-fly, which contributes to the generation of more precise and discriminative representations. Experimental results on the three major Video-Text Retrieval benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method.\n",
      "Several real-world scenarios, such as remote control and sensing, are comprised of action and observation delays. The presence of delays degrades the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, often to such an extent that algorithms fail to learn anything substantial. This paper formally describes the notion of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with stochastic delays and shows that delayed MDPs can be transformed into equivalent standard MDPs (without delays) with significantly simplified cost structure. We employ this equivalence to derive a model-free Delay-Resolved RL framework and show that even a simple RL algorithm built upon this framework achieves near-optimal rewards in environments with stochastic delays in actions and observations. The delay-resolved deep Q-network (DRDQN) algorithm is bench-marked on a variety of environments comprising of multi-step and stochastic delays and results in better performance, both in terms of achieving near-optimal rewards and minimizing the computational overhead thereof, with respect to the currently established algorithms.\n",
      "Successful sequential recommendation systems rely on accurately capturing the user's short-term and long-term interest. Although Transformer-based models achieved state-of-the-art performance in the sequential recommendation task, they generally require quadratic memory and time complexity to the sequence length, making it difficult to extract the long-term interest of users. On the other hand, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)-based models, renowned for their linear memory and time complexity, have recently shown competitive results compared to Transformer in various tasks. Given the availability of a massive amount of the user's behavior history, the linear memory and time complexity of MLP-based models make them a promising alternative to explore in the sequential recommendation task. To this end, we adopted MLP-based models in sequential recommendation but consistently observed that MLP-based methods obtain lower performance than those of Transformer despite their computational benefits. From experiments, we observed that introducing explicit high-order interactions to MLP layers mitigates such performance gap. In response, we propose the Multi-Order Interaction (MOI) layer, which is capable of expressing an arbitrary order of interactions within the inputs while maintaining the memory and time complexity of the MLP layer. By replacing the MLP layer with the MOI layer, our model was able to achieve comparable performance with Transformer-based models while retaining the MLP-based models' computational benefits.\n",
      "In this paper, we focus on recognizing 3D shapes from arbitrary views, i.e., arbitrary numbers and positions of viewpoints. It is a challenging and realistic setting for view-based 3D shape recognition. We propose a canonical view representation to tackle this challenge. We first transform the original features of arbitrary views to a fixed number of view features, dubbed canonical view representation, by aligning the arbitrary view features to a set of learnable reference view features using optimal transport. In this way, each 3D shape with arbitrary views is represented by a fixed number of canonical view features, which are further aggregated to generate a rich and robust 3D shape representation for shape recognition. We also propose a canonical view feature separation constraint to enforce that the view features in canonical view representation can be embedded into scattered points in a Euclidean space. Experiments on the ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and RGBD datasets show that our method achieves competitive results under the fixed viewpoint settings, and significantly outperforms the applicable methods under the arbitrary view setting.\n",
      "Perturbation-based attacks, while not physically realizable, have been the main emphasis of adversarial machine learning (ML) research. Patch-based attacks by contrast are physically realizable, yet most work has focused on 2D domain with recent forays into 3D. Characterizing the robustness properties of patch attacks and their invariance to 3D pose is important, yet not fully elucidated, and is the focus of this paper. To this end, several contributions are made here: A) we develop a new metric called mean Attack Success over Transformations (mAST) to evaluate patch attack robustness and invariance; and B), we systematically assess robustness of patch attacks to 3D position and orientation for various conditions; in particular, we conduct a sensitivity analysis which provides important qualitative insights into attack effectiveness as a function of the 3D pose of a patch relative to the camera (rotation, translation) and sets forth some properties for patch attack 3D invariance; and C), we draw novel qualitative conclusions including: 1) we demonstrate that for some 3D transformations, namely rotation and loom, increasing the training distribution support yields an increase in patch success over the full range at test time. 2) We provide new insights into the existence of a fundamental cutoff limit in patch attack effectiveness that depends on the extent of out-of-plane rotation angles. These findings should collectively guide future design of 3D patch attacks and defenses.\n",
      "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of machine learning and are widely deployed in many applications involving image, video, speech and natural language processing. The increasing compute demands of DNNs have been widely addressed through Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized accelerators. However, as model sizes grow, these von Neumann architectures require very high memory bandwidth to keep the processing elements utilized as a majority of the data resides in the main memory. Processing in memory has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall bottleneck for ML workloads. In this work, we propose a new DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) multiplication primitive coupled with intra-bank accumulation to accelerate matrix vector operations in ML workloads. The proposed multiplication primitive adds < 1% area overhead and does not require any change in the DRAM peripherals. Therefore, the proposed multiplication can be easily adopted in commodity DRAM chips. Subsequently, we design a DRAM-based PIM architecture, data mapping scheme and dataflow for executing DNNs within DRAM. System evaluations performed on networks like AlexNet, VGG16 and ResNet18 show that the proposed architecture, mapping, and data flow can provide up to 19.5x speedup over an NVIDIA Titan Xp GPU highlighting the need to overcome the memory bottleneck in future generations of DNN hardware.\n",
      "We present a general technique for constructing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) capable of using multi-relational domain knowledge. The technique is based on mode-directed inverse entailment (MDIE) developed in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Given a data instance $e$ and background knowledge $B$, MDIE identifies a most-specific logical formula $\\bot_B(e)$ that contains all the relational information in $B$ that is related to $e$. We represent $\\bot_B(e)$ by a \"bottom-graph\" that can be converted into a form suitable for GNN implementations. This transformation allows a principled way of incorporating generic background knowledge into GNNs: we use the term `BotGNN' for this form of graph neural networks. For several GNN variants, using real-world datasets with substantial background knowledge, we show that BotGNNs perform significantly better than both GNNs without background knowledge and a recently proposed simplified technique for including domain knowledge into GNNs. We also provide experimental evidence comparing BotGNNs favourably to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that use features representing a \"propositionalised\" form of the background knowledge; and BotGNNs to a standard ILP based on the use of most-specific clauses. Taken together, these results point to BotGNNs as capable of combining the computational efficacy of GNNs with the representational versatility of ILP.\n",
      "We present a framework for learning multimodal representations from unlabeled data using convolution-free Transformer architectures. Specifically, our Video-Audio-Text Transformer (VATT) takes raw signals as inputs and extracts multimodal representations that are rich enough to benefit a variety of downstream tasks. We train VATT end-to-end from scratch using multimodal contrastive losses and evaluate its performance by the downstream tasks of video action recognition, audio event classification, image classification, and text-to-video retrieval. Furthermore, we study a modality-agnostic single-backbone Transformer by sharing weights among the three modalities. We show that the convolution-free VATT outperforms state-of-the-art ConvNet-based architectures in the downstream tasks. Especially, VATT's vision Transformer achieves the top-1 accuracy of 82.1% on Kinetics-400, 83.6% on Kinetics-600,and 41.1% on Moments in Time, new records while avoiding supervised pre-training. Transferring to image classification leads to 78.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet compared to 64.7% by training the same Transformer from scratch, showing the generalizability of our model despite the domain gap between videos and images. VATT's audio Transformer also sets a new record on waveform-based audio event recognition by achieving the mAP of 39.4% on AudioSet without any supervised pre-training. VATT's source code is publicly available.\n",
      "Transformer, first applied to the field of natural language processing, is a type of deep neural network mainly based on the self-attention mechanism. Thanks to its strong representation capabilities, researchers are looking at ways to apply transformer to computer vision tasks. In a variety of visual benchmarks, transformer-based models perform similar to or better than other types of networks such as convolutional and recurrent networks. Given its high performance and less need for vision-specific inductive bias, transformer is receiving more and more attention from the computer vision community. In this paper, we review these vision transformer models by categorizing them in different tasks and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. The main categories we explore include the backbone network, high/mid-level vision, low-level vision, and video processing. We also include efficient transformer methods for pushing transformer into real device-based applications. Furthermore, we also take a brief look at the self-attention mechanism in computer vision, as it is the base component in transformer. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide several further research directions for vision transformers.\n",
      "In this paper, a new interval type-2 fuzzy neural network able to construct non-separable fuzzy rules with adaptive shapes is introduced. To reflect the uncertainty, the shape of fuzzy sets considered to be uncertain. Therefore, a new form of interval type-2 fuzzy sets based on a general Gaussian model able to construct different shapes (including triangular, bell-shaped, trapezoidal) is proposed. To consider the interactions among input variables, input vectors are transformed to new feature spaces with uncorrelated variables proper for defining each fuzzy rule. Next, the new features are fed to a fuzzification layer using proposed interval type-2 fuzzy sets with adaptive shape. Consequently, interval type-2 non-separable fuzzy rules with proper shapes, considering the local interactions of variables and the uncertainty are formed. For type reduction the contribution of the upper and lower firing strengths of each fuzzy rule are adaptively selected separately. To train different parameters of the network, the Levenberg-Marquadt optimization method is utilized. The performance of the proposed method is investigated on clean and noisy datasets to show the ability to consider the uncertainty. Moreover, the proposed paradigm, is successfully applied to real-world time-series predictions, regression problems, and nonlinear system identification. According to the experimental results, the performance of our proposed model outperforms other methods with a more parsimonious structure.\n",
      "Video question answering has recently received a lot of attention from multimodal video researchers. Most video question answering datasets are usually in the form of multiple-choice. But, the model for the multiple-choice task does not infer the answer. Rather it compares the answer candidates for picking the correct answer. Furthermore, it makes it difficult to extend to other tasks. In this paper, we challenge the existing multiple-choice video question answering by changing it to open-ended video question answering. To tackle open-ended question answering, we use the pretrained GPT2 model. The model is fine-tuned with video inputs and subtitles. An ablation study is performed by changing the existing DramaQA dataset to an open-ended question answering, and it shows that performance can be improved using video metadata.\n",
      "Recently proposed fine-grained 3D visual grounding is an essential and challenging task, whose goal is to identify the 3D object referred by a natural language sentence from other distractive objects of the same category. Existing works usually adopt dynamic graph networks to indirectly model the intra/inter-modal interactions, making the model difficult to distinguish the referred object from distractors due to the monolithic representations of visual and linguistic contents. In this work, we exploit Transformer for its natural suitability on permutation-invariant 3D point clouds data and propose a TransRefer3D network to extract entity-and-relation aware multimodal context among objects for more discriminative feature learning. Concretely, we devise an Entity-aware Attention (EA) module and a Relation-aware Attention (RA) module to conduct fine-grained cross-modal feature matching. Facilitated by co-attention operation, our EA module matches visual entity features with linguistic entity features while RA module matches pair-wise visual relation features with linguistic relation features, respectively. We further integrate EA and RA modules into an Entity-and-Relation aware Contextual Block (ERCB) and stack several ERCBs to form our TransRefer3D for hierarchical multimodal context modeling. Extensive experiments on both Nr3D and Sr3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing approaches by up to 10.6% and claims the new state-of-the-art. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating Transformer architecture for fine-grained 3D visual grounding task.\n",
      "Context is of fundamental importance to both human and machine vision; e.g., an object in the air is more likely to be an airplane than a pig. The rich notion of context incorporates several aspects including physics rules, statistical co-occurrences, and relative object sizes, among others. While previous work has focused on crowd-sourced out-of-context photographs from the web to study scene context, controlling the nature and extent of contextual violations has been a daunting task. Here we introduce a diverse, synthetic Out-of-Context Dataset (OCD) with fine-grained control over scene context. By leveraging a 3D simulation engine, we systematically control the gravity, object co-occurrences and relative sizes across 36 object categories in a virtual household environment. We conducted a series of experiments to gain insights into the impact of contextual cues on both human and machine vision using OCD. We conducted psychophysics experiments to establish a human benchmark for out-of-context recognition, and then compared it with state-of-the-art computer vision models to quantify the gap between the two. We propose a context-aware recognition transformer model, fusing object and contextual information via multi-head attention. Our model captures useful information for contextual reasoning, enabling human-level performance and better robustness in out-of-context conditions compared to baseline models across OCD and other out-of-context datasets.

      "Time series has wide applications in the real world and is known to be difficult to forecast. Since its statistical properties change over time, its distribution also changes temporally, which will cause severe distribution shift problem to existing methods. However, it remains unexplored to model the time series in the distribution perspective. In this paper, we term this as Temporal Covariate Shift (TCS). This paper proposes Adaptive RNNs (AdaRNN) to tackle the TCS problem by building an adaptive model that generalizes well on the unseen test data. AdaRNN is sequentially composed of two novel algorithms. First, we propose Temporal Distribution Characterization to better characterize the distribution information in the TS. Second, we propose Temporal Distribution Matching to reduce the distribution mismatch in TS to learn the adaptive TS model. AdaRNN is a general framework with flexible distribution distances integrated. Experiments on human activity recognition, air quality prediction, and financial analysis show that AdaRNN outperforms the latest methods by a classification accuracy of 2.6% and significantly reduces the RMSE by 9.0%. We also show that the temporal distribution matching algorithm can be extended in Transformer structure to boost its performance.\n",
      "Transformers have improved the state-of-the-art across numerous tasks in sequence modeling. Besides the quadratic computational and memory complexity w.r.t the sequence length, the self-attention mechanism only processes information at the same scale, i.e., all attention heads are in the same resolution, resulting in the limited power of the Transformer. To remedy this, we propose a novel and efficient structure named Adaptive Multi-Resolution Attention (AdaMRA for short), which scales linearly to sequence length in terms of time and space. Specifically, we leverage a multi-resolution multi-head attention mechanism, enabling attention heads to capture long-range contextual information in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, to capture the potential relations between query representation and clues of different attention granularities, we leave the decision of which resolution of attention to use to query, which further improves the model's capacity compared to vanilla Transformer. In an effort to reduce complexity, we adopt kernel attention without degrading the performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model by achieving a state-of-the-art performance-efficiency-memory trade-off. To facilitate AdaMRA utilization by the scientific community, the code implementation will be made publicly available.\n",
      "Vision-and-language(V&L) models take image and text as input and learn to capture the associations between them. Prior studies show that pre-trained V&L models can significantly improve the model performance for downstream tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, V&L models are less effective when applied in the medical domain (e.g., on X-ray images and clinical notes) due to the domain gap. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of applying pre-trained V&L models in medical applications. In particular, we identify that the visual representation in general V&L models is not suitable for processing medical data. To overcome this limitation, we propose BERTHop, a transformer-based model based on PixelHop++ and VisualBERT, for better capturing the associations between the two modalities. Experiments on the OpenI dataset, a commonly used thoracic disease diagnosis benchmark, show that BERTHop achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.12% which is 1.62% higher than state-of-the-art (SOTA) while it is trained on a 9 times smaller dataset.\n",
      "Language-guided robots performing home and office tasks must navigate in and interact with the world. Grounding language instructions against visual observations and actions to take in an environment is an open challenge. We present Embodied BERT (EmBERT), a transformer-based model which can attend to high-dimensional, multi-modal inputs across long temporal horizons for language-conditioned task completion. Additionally, we bridge the gap between successful object-centric navigation models used for non-interactive agents and the language-guided visual task completion benchmark, ALFRED, by introducing object navigation targets for EmBERT training. We achieve competitive performance on the ALFRED benchmark, and EmBERT marks the first transformer-based model to successfully handle the long-horizon, dense, multi-modal histories of ALFRED, and the first ALFRED model to utilize object-centric navigation targets.\n",
      "To improve the accessibility of smart devices and to simplify their usage, building models which understand user interfaces (UIs) and assist users to complete their tasks is critical. However, unique challenges are proposed by UI-specific characteristics, such as how to effectively leverage multimodal UI features that involve image, text, and structural metadata and how to achieve good performance when high-quality labeled data is unavailable. To address such challenges we introduce UIBert, a transformer-based joint image-text model trained through novel pre-training tasks on large-scale unlabeled UI data to learn generic feature representations for a UI and its components. Our key intuition is that the heterogeneous features in a UI are self-aligned, i.e., the image and text features of UI components, are predictive of each other. We propose five pretraining tasks utilizing this self-alignment among different features of a UI component and across various components in the same UI. We evaluate our method on nine real-world downstream UI tasks where UIBert outperforms strong multimodal baselines by up to 9.26% accuracy.\n",
      "The goals of this paper are two-fold. The first goal is to serve as an expository tutorial on the working of deep learning models which emphasizes geometrical intuition about the reasons for success of deep learning. The second goal is to complement the current results on the expressive power of deep learning models and their loss surfaces with novel insights and results. In particular, we describe how deep neural networks carve out manifolds especially when the multiplication neurons are introduced. Multiplication is used in dot products and the attention mechanism and it is employed in capsule networks and self-attention based transformers. We also describe how random polynomial, random matrix, spin glass and computational complexity perspectives on the loss surfaces are interconnected.\n",
      "For the past ten years, CNN has reigned supreme in the world of computer vision, but recently, Transformer is on the rise. However, the quadratic computational cost of self-attention has become a severe problem of practice. There has been much research on architectures without CNN and self-attention in this context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple idea designed using MLPs and hit an accuracy comparable to the Vision Transformer. However, the only inductive bias in this architecture is the embedding of tokens. Thus, there is still a possibility to build a non-convolutional inductive bias into the architecture itself, and we built in an inductive bias using two simple ideas. A way is to divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another way is to make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing. With this approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while reducing its parameters and computational complexity. Compared to other MLP-based models, the proposed model, named RaftMLP has a good balance of computational complexity, the number of parameters, and actual memory usage. In addition, our work indicates that MLP-based models have the potential to replace CNNs by adopting inductive bias. The source code in PyTorch version is available at \\url{https://github.com/okojoalg/raft-mlp}.\n",
      "In machine learning, active class selection (ACS) algorithms aim to actively select a class and ask the oracle to provide an instance for that class to optimize a classifier's performance while minimizing the number of requests. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm (PAL-ACS) that transforms the ACS problem into an active learning task by introducing pseudo instances. These are used to estimate the usefulness of an upcoming instance for each class using the performance gain model from probabilistic active learning. Our experimental evaluation (on synthetic and real data) shows the advantages of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. It effectively prefers the sampling of difficult classes and thereby improves the classification performance.\n",
      "Images tell powerful stories but cannot always be trusted. Matching images back to trusted sources (attribution) enables users to make a more informed judgment of the images they encounter online. We propose a robust image hashing algorithm to perform such matching. Our hash is sensitive to manipulation of subtle, salient visual details that can substantially change the story told by an image. Yet the hash is invariant to benign transformations (changes in quality, codecs, sizes, shapes, etc.) experienced by images during online redistribution. Our key contribution is OSCAR-Net (Object-centric Scene Graph Attention for Image Attribution Network); a robust image hashing model inspired by recent successes of Transformers in the visual domain. OSCAR-Net constructs a scene graph representation that attends to fine-grained changes of every object's visual appearance and their spatial relationships. The network is trained via contrastive learning on a dataset of original and manipulated images yielding a state of the art image hash for content fingerprinting that scales to millions of images.\n",
      "Voting systems have a wide range of applications including recommender systems, web search, product design and elections. Limited by the lack of general-purpose analytical tools, it is difficult to hand-engineer desirable voting rules for each use case. For this reason, it is appealing to automatically discover voting rules geared towards each scenario. In this paper, we show that set-input neural network architectures such as Set Transformers, fully-connected graph networks and DeepSets are both theoretically and empirically well-suited for learning voting rules. In particular, we show that these network models can not only mimic a number of existing voting rules to compelling accuracy --- both position-based (such as Plurality and Borda) and comparison-based (such as Kemeny, Copeland and Maximin) --- but also discover near-optimal voting rules that maximize different social welfare functions. Furthermore, the learned voting rules generalize well to different voter utility distributions and election sizes unseen during training.\n",
      "The research on human emotion under multimedia stimulation based on physiological signals is an emerging field, and important progress has been achieved for emotion recognition based on multi-modal signals. However, it is challenging to make full use of the complementarity among spatial-spectral-temporal domain features for emotion recognition, as well as model the heterogeneity and correlation among multi-modal signals. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream heterogeneous graph recurrent neural network, named HetEmotionNet, fusing multi-modal physiological signals for emotion recognition. Specifically, HetEmotionNet consists of the spatial-temporal stream and the spatial-spectral stream, which can fuse spatial-spectral-temporal domain features in a unified framework. Each stream is composed of the graph transformer network for modeling the heterogeneity, the graph convolutional network for modeling the correlation, and the gated recurrent unit for capturing the temporal domain or spectral domain dependency. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.\n",
      "In many sequence learning tasks, such as program synthesis and document summarization, a key problem is searching over a large space of possible output sequences. We propose to learn representations of the outputs that are specifically meant for search: rich enough to specify the desired output but compact enough to make search more efficient. Discrete latent codes are appealing for this purpose, as they naturally allow sophisticated combinatorial search strategies. The latent codes are learned using a self-supervised learning principle, in which first a discrete autoencoder is trained on the output sequences, and then the resulting latent codes are used as intermediate targets for the end-to-end sequence prediction task. Based on these insights, we introduce the \\emph{Latent Programmer}, a program synthesis method that first predicts a discrete latent code from input/output examples, and then generates the program in the target language. We evaluate the Latent Programmer on two domains: synthesis of string transformation programs, and generation of programs from natural language descriptions. We demonstrate that the discrete latent representation significantly improves synthesis accuracy.\n",
      "The rapid increase in the percentage of chronic disease patients along with the recent pandemic pose immediate threats on healthcare expenditure and elevate causes of death. This calls for transforming healthcare systems away from one-on-one patient treatment into intelligent health systems, to improve services, access and scalability, while reducing costs. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has witnessed an intrinsic breakthrough in solving a variety of complex problems for diverse applications and services. Thus, we conduct in this paper a comprehensive survey of the recent models and techniques of RL that have been developed/used for supporting Intelligent-healthcare (I-health) systems. This paper can guide the readers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art regarding the use of RL in the context of I-health. Specifically, we first present an overview for the I-health systems challenges, architecture, and how RL can benefit these systems. We then review the background and mathematical modeling of different RL, Deep RL (DRL), and multi-agent RL models. After that, we provide a deep literature review for the applications of RL in I-health systems. In particular, three main areas have been tackled, i.e., edge intelligence, smart core network, and dynamic treatment regimes. Finally, we highlight emerging challenges and outline future research directions in driving the future success of RL in I-health systems, which opens the door for exploring some interesting and unsolved problems.\n",
      "Interventional causal models describe several joint distributions over some variables used to describe a system, one for each intervention setting. They provide a formal recipe for how to move between the different joint distributions and make predictions about the variables upon intervening on the system. Yet, it is difficult to formalise how we may change the underlying variables used to describe the system, say moving from fine-grained to coarse-grained variables. Here, we argue that compositionality is a desideratum for such model transformations and the associated errors: When abstracting a reference model M iteratively, first obtaining M' and then further simplifying that to obtain M'', we expect the composite transformation from M to M'' to exist and its error to be bounded by the errors incurred by each individual transformation step. Category theory, the study of mathematical objects via compositional transformations between them, offers a natural language to develop our framework for model transformations and abstractions. We introduce a category of finite interventional causal models and, leveraging theory of enriched categories, prove the desired compositionality properties for our framework.\n",
      "The study presents a new method for analyzing medical data based on the LogNNet neural network, which uses chaotic mappings to transform input information. The technique calculates risk factors for the presence of a disease in a patient according to a set of medical health indicators. The LogNNet architecture allows the implementation of artificial intelligence on medical pe-ripherals of the Internet of Things with low RAM resources, and the development of edge computing in healthcare. The efficiency of LogNNet in assessing perinatal risk is illustrated on cardiotocogram data of 2126 pregnant women, obtained from the UC Irvine machine learning repository. The classification accuracy reaches ~ 91%, with the ~ 3-10 kB of RAM used on the Arduino microcontroller. In addition, examples for diagnosing COVID-19 are provided, using LogNNet trained on a publicly available database from the Israeli Ministry of Health. The service concept has been developed, which uses the data of the express test for COVID-19 and reaches the classification accuracy of ~ 95% with the ~ 0.6 kB of RAM used on Arduino microcontrollers. In all examples, the model is tested using standard classification quality metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-measure. The study results can be used in clinical decision support systems.\n",
      "We propose FMMformers, a class of efficient and flexible transformers inspired by the celebrated fast multipole method (FMM) for accelerating interacting particle simulation. FMM decomposes particle-particle interaction into near-field and far-field components and then performs direct and coarse-grained computation, respectively. Similarly, FMMformers decompose the attention into near-field and far-field attention, modeling the near-field attention by a banded matrix and the far-field attention by a low-rank matrix. Computing the attention matrix for FMMformers requires linear complexity in computational time and memory footprint with respect to the sequence length. In contrast, standard transformers suffer from quadratic complexity. We analyze and validate the advantage of FMMformers over the standard transformer on the Long Range Arena and language modeling benchmarks. FMMformers can even outperform the standard transformer in terms of accuracy by a significant margin. For instance, FMMformers achieve an average classification accuracy of $60.74\\%$ over the five Long Range Arena tasks, which is significantly better than the standard transformer's average accuracy of $58.70\\%$.\n",
      "Exponential families are widely used in machine learning; they include many distributions in continuous and discrete domains (e.g., Gaussian, Dirichlet, Poisson, and categorical distributions via the softmax transformation). Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent works on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax, $\\alpha$-entmax, and fusedmax) and corresponding losses, which have varying support.   This paper expands that line of work in several directions: first, it extends $\\Omega$-regularized prediction maps and Fenchel-Young losses to arbitrary domains (possibly countably infinite or continuous). For linearly parametrized families, we show that minimization of Fenchel-Young losses is equivalent to moment matching of the statistics, generalizing a fundamental property of exponential families. When $\\Omega$ is a Tsallis negentropy with parameter $\\alpha$, we obtain \"deformed exponential families,\" which include $\\alpha$-entmax and sparsemax ($\\alpha$ = 2) as particular cases. For quadratic energy functions in continuous domains, the resulting densities are $\\beta$-Gaussians, an instance of elliptical distributions that contain as particular cases the Gaussian, biweight, triweight and Epanechnikov densities, and for which we derive closed-form expressions for the variance, Tsallis entropy, and Fenchel-Young loss. When $\\Omega$ is a total variation or Sobolev regularizer, we obtain a continuous version of the fusedmax. Finally, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for $\\alpha \\in \\{1, 4/3, 3/2, 2\\}$. Using them, we demonstrate our sparse continuous distributions for attention-based audio classification and visual question answering, showing that they allow attending to time intervals and compact regions.\n",
      "Most existing neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms are dedicated to the downstream tasks, e.g., image classification in computer vision. However, extensive experiments have shown that, prominent neural architectures, such as ResNet in computer vision and LSTM in natural language processing, are generally good at extracting patterns from the input data and perform well on different downstream tasks. These observations inspire us to ask: Is it necessary to use the performance of specific downstream tasks to evaluate and search for good neural architectures? Can we perform NAS effectively and efficiently while being agnostic to the downstream task? In this work, we attempt to affirmatively answer the above two questions and improve the state-of-the-art NAS solution by proposing a novel and generic NAS framework, termed Generic NAS (GenNAS). GenNAS does not use task-specific labels but instead adopts \\textit{regression} on a set of manually designed synthetic signal bases for architecture evaluation. Such a self-supervised regression task can effectively evaluate the intrinsic power of an architecture to capture and transform the input signal patterns, and allow more sufficient usage of training samples. We then propose an automatic task search to optimize the combination of synthetic signals using limited downstream-task-specific labels, further improving the performance of GenNAS. We also thoroughly evaluate GenNAS's generality and end-to-end NAS performance on all search spaces, which outperforms almost all existing works with significant speedup.\n",
      "Operational Neural Networks (ONNs) are new generation network models that can perform any (non-linear) transformation with a proper combination of \"nodal\" and \"pool\" operators. However, they still have a certain restriction, which is the sole usage of a single nodal operator for all (synaptic) connections of each neuron. The idea behind the \"generative neurons\" was born as a remedy for this restriction where each nodal operator can be \"customized\" during the training in order to maximize the learning performance. Self-Organized ONNs (Self-ONNs) composed with the generative neurons can achieve an utmost level of diversity even with a compact configuration; however, it still suffers from the last property that was inherited from the CNNs: localized kernel operations which imposes a severe limitation to the information flow between layers. It is, therefore, desirable for the neurons to gather information from a larger area in the previous layer maps without increasing the kernel size. For certain applications, it might be even more desirable \"to learn\" the kernel locations of each connection during the training process along with the customized nodal operators so that both can be optimized simultaneously. This study introduces the super (generative) neuron models that can accomplish this without altering the kernel sizes and will enable a significant diversity in terms of information flow. The two models of super neurons proposed in this study vary on the localization process of the kernels: i) randomly localized kernels within a bias range set for each layer, ii) optimized locations of each kernel during the Back-Propagation (BP) training. The extensive set of comparative evaluations show that Self-ONNs with super-neurons can indeed achieve a superior learning and generalization capability without any significant rise of the computational complexity.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning from large-scale offline datasets provides us with the ability to learn policies without potentially unsafe or impractical exploration. Significant progress has been made in the past few years in dealing with the challenge of correcting for differing behavior between the data collection and learned policies. However, little attention has been paid to potentially changing dynamics when transferring a policy to the online setting, where performance can be up to 90% reduced for existing methods. In this paper we address this problem with Augmented World Models (AugWM). We augment a learned dynamics model with simple transformations that seek to capture potential changes in physical properties of the robot, leading to more robust policies. We not only train our policy in this new setting, but also provide it with the sampled augmentation as a context, allowing it to adapt to changes in the environment. At test time we learn the context in a self-supervised fashion by approximating the augmentation which corresponds to the new environment. We rigorously evaluate our approach on over 100 different changed dynamics settings, and show that this simple approach can significantly improve the zero-shot generalization of a recent state-of-the-art baseline, often achieving successful policies where the baseline fails.\n",
      "We propose three improvements to vision transformers (ViT) to reduce the number of trainable parameters without compromising classification accuracy. We address two shortcomings of the early ViT architectures -- quadratic bottleneck of the attention mechanism and the lack of an inductive bias in their architectures that rely on unrolling the two-dimensional image structure. Linear attention mechanisms overcome the bottleneck of quadratic complexity, which restricts application of transformer models in vision tasks. We modify the ViT architecture to work on longer sequence data by replacing the quadratic attention with efficient transformers, such as Performer, Linformer and Nystr\\\"omformer of linear complexity creating Vision X-formers (ViX). We show that all three versions of ViX may be more accurate than ViT for image classification while using far fewer parameters and computational resources. We also compare their performance with FNet and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) mixer. We further show that replacing the initial linear embedding layer by convolutional layers in ViX further increases their performance. Furthermore, our tests on recent vision transformer models, such as LeViT, Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT), Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) and Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT) show that replacing the attention with Nystr\\\"omformer or Performer saves GPU usage and memory without deteriorating the classification accuracy. We also show that replacing the standard learnable 1D position embeddings in ViT with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) give further improvements in accuracy. Incorporating these changes can democratize transformers by making them accessible to those with limited data and computing resources.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have already been widely applied in various graph mining tasks. However, they suffer from the shallow architecture issue, which is the key impediment that hinders the model performance improvement. Although several relevant approaches have been proposed, none of the existing studies provides an in-depth understanding of the root causes of performance degradation in deep GNNs. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic experimental evaluation to present the fundamental limitations of shallow architectures. Based on the experimental results, we answer the following two essential questions: (1) what actually leads to the compromised performance of deep GNNs; (2) when we need and how to build deep GNNs. The answers to the above questions provide empirical insights and guidelines for researchers to design deep and well-performed GNNs. To show the effectiveness of our proposed guidelines, we present Deep Graph Multi-Layer Perceptron (DGMLP), a powerful approach (a paradigm in its own right) that helps guide deep GNN designs. Experimental results demonstrate three advantages of DGMLP: 1) high accuracy -- it achieves state-of-the-art node classification performance on various datasets; 2) high flexibility -- it can flexibly choose different propagation and transformation depths according to graph size and sparsity; 3) high scalability and efficiency -- it supports fast training on large-scale graphs.

      "Semi-supervised approaches for crowd counting attract attention, as the fully supervised paradigm is expensive and laborious due to its request for a large number of images of dense crowd scenarios and their annotations. This paper proposes a spatial uncertainty-aware semi-supervised approach via regularized surrogate task (binary segmentation) for crowd counting problems. Different from existing semi-supervised learning-based crowd counting methods, to exploit the unlabeled data, our proposed spatial uncertainty-aware teacher-student framework focuses on high confident regions' information while addressing the noisy supervision from the unlabeled data in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we estimate the spatial uncertainty maps from the teacher model's surrogate task to guide the feature learning of the main task (density regression) and the surrogate task of the student model at the same time. Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective differential transformation layer to enforce the inherent spatial consistency regularization between the main task and the surrogate task in the student model, which helps the surrogate task to yield more reliable predictions and generates high-quality uncertainty maps. Thus, our model can also address the task-level perturbation problems that occur spatial inconsistency between the primary and surrogate tasks in the student model. Experimental results on four challenging crowd counting datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.\n",
      "The bucketed PCA neural network (PCA-NN) with transforms is developed here in an effort to benchmark deep neural networks (DNN's), for problems on supervised classification. Most classical PCA models apply PCA to the entire training data set to establish a reductive representation and then employ non-network tools such as high-order polynomial classifiers. In contrast, the bucketed PCA-NN applies PCA to individual buckets which are constructed in two consecutive phases, as well as retains a genuine architecture of a neural network. This facilitates a fair apple-to-apple comparison to DNN's, esp. to reveal that a major chunk of accuracy achieved by many impressive DNN's could possibly be explained by the bucketed PCA-NN (e.g., 96% out of 98% for the MNIST data set as an example). Compared with most DNN's, the three building blocks of the bucketed PCA-NN are easier to comprehend conceptually - PCA, transforms, and bucketing for error correction. Furthermore, unlike the somewhat quasi-random neurons ubiquitously observed in DNN's, the PCA neurons resemble or mirror the input signals and are more straightforward to decipher as a result.\n",
      "Microorganisms are widely distributed in the human daily living environment. They play an essential role in environmental pollution control, disease prevention and treatment, and food and drug production. The identification, counting, and detection are the basic steps for making full use of different microorganisms.

We conduct this review to understand the development process of microorganism image analysis based on artificial neural networks. In this review, the background and motivation are introduced first. Then, the development of artificial neural networks and representative networks are introduced.

      "Stereo matching has recently witnessed remarkable progress using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). But, how robust are they? Although it has been well-known that DNNs often suffer from adversarial vulnerability with a catastrophic drop in performance, the situation is even worse in stereo matching. This paper first shows that a type of weak white-box attacks can fail state-of-the-art methods. The attack is learned by a proposed stereo-constrained projected gradient descent (PGD) method in stereo matching. This observation raises serious concerns for the deployment of DNN-based stereo matching. Parallel to the adversarial vulnerability, DNN-based stereo matching is typically trained under the so-called simulation to reality pipeline, and thus domain generalizability is an important problem. This paper proposes to rethink the learnable DNN-based feature backbone towards adversarially-robust and domain generalizable stereo matching, either by completely removing it or by applying it only to the left reference image. It computes the matching cost volume using the classic multi-scale census transform (i.e., local binary pattern) of the raw input stereo images, followed by a stacked Hourglass head sub-network solving the matching problem. In experiments, the proposed method is tested in the SceneFlow dataset and the KITTI2015 benchmark. It significantly improves the adversarial robustness, while retaining accuracy performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. It also shows better generalizability from simulation (SceneFlow) to real (KITTI) datasets when no fine-tuning is used.\n",
      "Current one-stage methods for visual grounding encode the language query as one holistic sentence embedding before fusion with visual feature. Such a formulation does not treat each word of a query sentence on par when modeling language to visual attention, therefore prone to neglect words which are less important for sentence embedding but critical for visual grounding. In this paper we propose Word2Pix: a one-stage visual grounding network based on encoder-decoder transformer architecture that enables learning for textual to visual feature correspondence via word to pixel attention. The embedding of each word from the query sentence is treated alike by attending to visual pixels individually instead of single holistic sentence embedding. In this way, each word is given equivalent opportunity to adjust the language to vision attention towards the referent target through multiple stacks of transformer decoder layers. We conduct the experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg datasets and the proposed Word2Pix outperforms existing one-stage methods by a notable margin. The results obtained also show that Word2Pix surpasses two-stage visual grounding models, while at the same time keeping the merits of one-stage paradigm namely end-to-end training and real-time inference speed intact.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown a promising performance in learning optimal policies for a variety of sequential decision-making tasks. However, in many real-world RL problems, besides optimizing the main objectives, the agent is expected to satisfy a certain level of safety (e.g., avoiding collisions in autonomous driving). While RL problems are commonly formalized as Markov decision processes (MDPs), safety constraints are incorporated via constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). Although recent advances in safe RL have enabled learning safe policies in CMDPs, these safety requirements should be satisfied during both training and in the deployment process. Furthermore, it is shown that in memory-based and partially observable environments, these methods fail to maintain safety over unseen out-of-distribution observations. To address these limitations, we propose a Lyapunov-based uncertainty-aware safe RL model. The introduced model adopts a Lyapunov function that converts trajectory-based constraints to a set of local linear constraints. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of the agent in highly uncertain environments, an uncertainty quantification method is developed that enables identifying risk-averse actions through estimating the probability of constraint violations. Moreover, a Transformers model is integrated to provide the agent with memory to process long time horizons of information via the self-attention mechanism. The proposed model is evaluated in grid-world navigation tasks where safety is defined as avoiding static and dynamic obstacles in fully and partially observable environments. The results of these experiments show a significant improvement in the performance of the agent both in achieving optimality and satisfying safety constraints.\n",
      "Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across non-overlapping camera views. The majority of Re-ID methods focus on small-scale surveillance systems in which each pedestrian is captured in different camera views of adjacent scenes. However, in large-scale surveillance systems that cover larger areas, it is required to track a pedestrian of interest across distant scenes (e.g., a criminal suspect escapes from one city to another). Since most pedestrians appear in limited local areas, it is difficult to collect training data with cross-camera pairs of the same person. In this work, we study intra-camera supervised person re-identification across distant scenes (ICS-DS Re-ID), which uses cross-camera unpaired data with intra-camera identity labels for training. It is challenging as cross-camera paired data plays a crucial role for learning camera-invariant features in most existing Re-ID methods. To learn camera-invariant representation from cross-camera unpaired training data, we propose a cross-camera feature prediction method to mine cross-camera self supervision information from camera-specific feature distribution by transforming fake cross-camera positive feature pairs and minimize the distances of the fake pairs. Furthermore, we automatically localize and extract local-level feature by a transformer. Joint learning of global-level and local-level features forms a global-local cross-camera feature prediction scheme for mining fine-grained cross-camera self supervision information. Finally, cross-camera self supervision and intra-camera supervision are aggregated in a framework. The experiments are conducted in the ICS-DS setting on Market-SCT, Duke-SCT and MSMT17-SCT datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate the superiority of our method, which gains significant improvements of 15.4 Rank-1 and 22.3 mAP on Market-SCT as compared to the second best method.\n",
      "Detecting abnormal activities in real-world surveillance videos is an important yet challenging task as the prior knowledge about video anomalies is usually limited or unavailable. Despite that many approaches have been developed to resolve this problem, few of them can capture the normal spatio-temporal patterns effectively and efficiently. Moreover, existing works seldom explicitly consider the local consistency at frame level and global coherence of temporal dynamics in video sequences. To this end, we propose Convolutional Transformer based Dual Discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (CT-D2GAN) to perform unsupervised video anomaly detection. Specifically, we first present a convolutional transformer to perform future frame prediction. It contains three key components, i.e., a convolutional encoder to capture the spatial information of the input video clips, a temporal self-attention module to encode the temporal dynamics, and a convolutional decoder to integrate spatio-temporal features and predict the future frame. Next, a dual discriminator based adversarial training procedure, which jointly considers an image discriminator that can maintain the local consistency at frame-level and a video discriminator that can enforce the global coherence of temporal dynamics, is employed to enhance the future frame prediction. Finally, the prediction error is used to identify abnormal video frames. Thoroughly empirical studies on three public video anomaly detection datasets, i.e., UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and Shanghai Tech Campus, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial spatio-temporal modeling framework.\n",
      "The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes the behavior of infinitely wide neural nets trained under least squares loss by gradient descent. However, despite its importance, the super-quadratic runtime of kernel methods limits the use of NTK in large-scale learning tasks. To accelerate kernel machines with NTK, we propose a near input sparsity time algorithm that maps the input data to a randomized low-dimensional feature space so that the inner product of the transformed data approximates their NTK evaluation. Our transformation works by sketching the polynomial expansions of arc-cosine kernels. Furthermore, we propose a feature map for approximating the convolutional counterpart of the NTK, which can transform any image using a runtime that is only linear in the number of pixels. We show that in standard large-scale regression and classification tasks a linear regressor trained on our features outperforms trained Neural Nets and Nystrom approximation of NTK kernel.\n",
      "Self-supervised pre-training of large-scale transformer models on text corpora followed by finetuning has achieved state-of-the-art on a number of natural language processing tasks. Recently, Lu et al. (2021, arXiv:2103.05247) claimed that frozen pretrained transformers (FPTs) match or outperform training from scratch as well as unfrozen (fine-tuned) pretrained transformers in a set of transfer tasks to other modalities. In our work, we find that this result is, in fact, an artifact of not tuning the learning rates. After carefully redesigning the empirical setup, we find that when tuning learning rates properly, pretrained transformers do outperform or match training from scratch in all of our tasks, but only as long as the entire model is finetuned. Thus, while transfer from pretrained language models to other modalities does indeed provide gains and hints at exciting possibilities for future work, properly tuning hyperparameters is important for arriving at robust findings.\n",
      "Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have demonstrated their power in various applications, the graph convolutional layers, as the most important component of GCN, are still using linear transformations and a simple pooling step. In this paper, we propose a novel generalization of Factorized Bilinear (FB) layer to model the feature interactions in GCNs. FB performs two matrix-vector multiplications, that is, the weight matrix is multiplied with the outer product of the vector of hidden features from both sides. However, the FB layer suffers from the quadratic number of coefficients, overfitting and the spurious correlations due to correlations between channels of hidden representations that violate the i.i.d. assumption. Thus, we propose a compact FB layer by defining a family of summarizing operators applied over the quadratic term. We analyze proposed pooling operators and motivate their use. Our experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the GFB-GCN is competitive with other methods for text classification.\n",
      "Explainability of deep neural networks is one of the most challenging and interesting problems in the field. In this study, we investigate the topic focusing on the interpretability of deep learning-based registration methods. In particular, with the appropriate model architecture and using a simple linear projection, we decompose the encoding space, generating a new basis, and we empirically show that this basis captures various decomposed anatomically aware geometrical transformations. We perform experiments using two different datasets focusing on lungs and hippocampus MRI. We show that such an approach can decompose the highly convoluted latent spaces of registration pipelines in an orthogonal space with several interesting properties. We hope that this work could shed some light on a better understanding of deep learning-based registration methods.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning (RL) is typically concerned with estimating single-step policies or single-step models, leveraging the Markov property to factorize the problem in time. However, we can also view RL as a sequence modeling problem, with the goal being to predict a sequence of actions that leads to a sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to consider whether powerful, high-capacity sequence prediction models that work well in other domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide simple and effective solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how RL can be reframed as \"one big sequence modeling\" problem, using state-of-the-art Transformer architectures to model distributions over sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Addressing RL as a sequence modeling problem significantly simplifies a range of design decisions: we no longer require separate behavior policy constraints, as is common in prior work on offline model-free RL, and we no longer require ensembles or other epistemic uncertainty estimators, as is common in prior work on model-based RL. All of these roles are filled by the same Transformer sequence model. In our experiments, we demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and offline RL.\n",
      "Detecting customized moments and highlights from videos given natural language (NL) user queries is an important but under-studied topic. One of the challenges in pursuing this direction is the lack of annotated data. To address this issue, we present the Query-based Video Highlights (QVHighlights) dataset. It consists of over 10,000 YouTube videos, covering a wide range of topics, from everyday activities and travel in lifestyle vlog videos to social and political activities in news videos. Each video in the dataset is annotated with: (1) a human-written free-form NL query, (2) relevant moments in the video w.r.t. the query, and (3) five-point scale saliency scores for all query-relevant clips. This comprehensive annotation enables us to develop and evaluate systems that detect relevant moments as well as salient highlights for diverse, flexible user queries. We also present a strong baseline for this task, Moment-DETR, a transformer encoder-decoder model that views moment retrieval as a direct set prediction problem, taking extracted video and query representations as inputs and predicting moment coordinates and saliency scores end-to-end. While our model does not utilize any human prior, we show that it performs competitively when compared to well-engineered architectures. With weakly supervised pretraining using ASR captions, Moment-DETR substantially outperforms previous methods. Lastly, we present several ablations and visualizations of Moment-DETR. Data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/jayleicn/moment_detr\n",
      "Computational intelligence-based ocean characteristics forecasting applications, such as Significant Wave Height (SWH) prediction, are crucial for avoiding social and economic loss in coastal cities. Compared to the traditional empirical-based or numerical-based forecasting models, \"soft computing\" approaches, including machine learning and deep learning models, have shown numerous success in recent years. In this paper, we focus on enabling the deep learning model to learn both short-term and long-term spatial-temporal dependencies for SWH prediction. A Wavelet Graph Neural Network (WGNN) approach is proposed to integrate the advantages of wavelet transform and graph neural network. Several parallel graph neural networks are separately trained on wavelet decomposed data, and the reconstruction of each model's prediction forms the final SWH prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed WGNN approach outperforms other models, including the numerical models, the machine learning models, and several deep learning models.\n",
      "Current datasets to train social behaviors are usually borrowed from surveillance applications that capture visual data from a bird's-eye perspective. This leaves aside precious relationships and visual cues that could be captured through a first-person view of a scene. In this work, we propose a strategy to exploit the power of current game engines, such as Unity, to transform pre-existing bird's-eye view datasets into a first-person view, in particular, a depth view. Using this strategy, we are able to generate large volumes of synthetic data that can be used to pre-train a social navigation model. To test our ideas, we present DeepSocNav, a deep learning based model that takes advantage of the proposed approach to generate synthetic data. Furthermore, DeepSocNav includes a self-supervised strategy that is included as an auxiliary task. This consists of predicting the next depth frame that the agent will face. Our experiments show the benefits of the proposed model that is able to outperform relevant baselines in terms of social navigation scores.\n",
      "We introduce a new class of graph neural networks (GNNs), by combining several concepts that were so far studied independently - graph kernels, attention-based networks with structural priors and more recently, efficient Transformers architectures applying small memory footprint implicit attention methods via low rank decomposition techniques. The goal of the paper is twofold. Proposed by us Graph Kernel Attention Transformers (or GKATs) are much more expressive than SOTA GNNs as capable of modeling longer-range dependencies within a single layer. Consequently, they can use more shallow architecture design. Furthermore, GKAT attention layers scale linearly rather than quadratically in the number of nodes of the input graphs, even when those graphs are dense, requiring less compute than their regular graph attention counterparts. They achieve it by applying new classes of graph kernels admitting random feature map decomposition via random walks on graphs. As a byproduct of the introduced techniques, we obtain a new class of learnable graph sketches, called graphots, compactly encoding topological graph properties as well as nodes' features. We conducted exhaustive empirical comparison of our method with nine different GNN classes on tasks ranging from motif detection through social network classification to bioinformatics challenges, showing consistent gains coming from GKATs.\n",
      "We present DeepMVI, a deep learning method for missing value imputation in multidimensional time-series datasets. Missing values are commonplace in decision support platforms that aggregate data over long time stretches from disparate sources, and reliable data analytics calls for careful handling of missing data. One strategy is imputing the missing values, and a wide variety of algorithms exist spanning simple interpolation, matrix factorization methods like SVD, statistical models like Kalman filters, and recent deep learning methods. We show that often these provide worse results on aggregate analytics compared to just excluding the missing data. DeepMVI uses a neural network to combine fine-grained and coarse-grained patterns along a time series, and trends from related series across categorical dimensions. After failing with off-the-shelf neural architectures, we design our own network that includes a temporal transformer with a novel convolutional window feature, and kernel regression with learned embeddings. The parameters and their training are designed carefully to generalize across different placements of missing blocks and data characteristics. Experiments across nine real datasets, four different missing scenarios, comparing seven existing methods show that DeepMVI is significantly more accurate, reducing error by more than 50% in more than half the cases, compared to the best existing method. Although slower than simpler matrix factorization methods, we justify the increased time overheads by showing that DeepMVI is the only option that provided overall more accurate analytics than dropping missing values.\n",
      "It is difficult to collect data on a large scale in a monocular depth estimation because the task requires the simultaneous acquisition of RGB images and depths. Data augmentation is thus important to this task. However, there has been little research on data augmentation for tasks such as monocular depth estimation, where the transformation is performed pixel by pixel. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method, called CutDepth. In CutDepth, part of the depth is pasted onto an input image during training. The method extends variations data without destroying edge features. Experiments objectively and subjectively show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods of data augmentation. The estimation accuracy is improved with CutDepth even though there are few training data at long distances.\n",
      "Normalizing flows, which learn a distribution by transforming the data to samples from a Gaussian base distribution, have proven powerful density approximations. But their expressive power is limited by this choice of the base distribution. We, therefore, propose to generalize the base distribution to a more elaborate copula distribution to capture the properties of the target distribution more accurately. In a first empirical analysis, we demonstrate that this replacement can dramatically improve the vanilla normalizing flows in terms of flexibility, stability, and effectivity for heavy-tailed data. Our results suggest that the improvements are related to an increased local Lipschitz-stability of the learned flow.\n",
      "The cognitive system for human action and behavior has evolved into a deep learning regime, and especially the advent of Graph Convolution Networks has transformed the field in recent years. However, previous works have mainly focused on over-parameterized and complex models based on dense graph convolution networks, resulting in low efficiency in training and inference. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture-based model has not yet been well explored for cognitive application in human action and behavior estimation. This work proposes a novel skeleton-based human action recognition model with sparse attention on the spatial dimension and segmented linear attention on the temporal dimension of data. Our model can also process the variable length of video clips grouped as a single batch. Experiments show that our model can achieve comparable performance while utilizing much less trainable parameters and achieve high speed in training and inference. Experiments show that our model achieves 4~18x speedup and 1/7~1/15 model size compared with the baseline models at competitive accuracy.\n",
      "An impact of climate change is the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events. However, confidently predicting the likelihood of extreme precipitation at seasonal scales remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we present an approach to forecasting the quantiles of the maximum daily precipitation in each week up to six months ahead using the temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model. Through experiments in two regions, we compare TFT predictions with those of two baselines: climatology and a calibrated ECMWF SEAS5 ensemble forecast (S5). Our results show that, in terms of quantile risk at six month lead time, the TFT predictions significantly outperform those from S5 and show an overall small improvement compared to climatology. The TFT also responds positively to departures from normal that climatology cannot.\n",
      "Recently, with the advance of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), person Re-Identification (Re-ID) has witnessed great success in various applications. However, with limited receptive fields of CNNs, it is still challenging to extract discriminative representations in a global view for persons under non-overlapped cameras. Meanwhile, Transformers demonstrate strong abilities of modeling long-range dependencies for spatial and sequential data. In this work, we take advantages of both CNNs and Transformers, and propose a novel learning framework named Hierarchical Aggregation Transformer (HAT) for image-based person Re-ID with high performance. To achieve this goal, we first propose a Deeply Supervised Aggregation (DSA) to recurrently aggregate hierarchical features from CNN backbones. With multi-granularity supervisions, the DSA can enhance multi-scale features for person retrieval, which is very different from previous methods. Then, we introduce a Transformer-based Feature Calibration (TFC) to integrate low-level detail information as the global prior for high-level semantic information. The proposed TFC is inserted to each level of hierarchical features, resulting in great performance improvements. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to take advantages of both CNNs and Transformers for image-based person Re-ID. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale Re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that our method shows better results than several state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at https://github.com/AI-Zhpp/HAT.\n",
      "Data transformations (e.g. rotations, reflections, and cropping) play an important role in self-supervised learning. Typically, images are transformed into different views, and neural networks trained on tasks involving these views produce useful feature representations for downstream tasks, including anomaly detection. However, for anomaly detection beyond image data, it is often unclear which transformations to use. Here we present a simple end-to-end procedure for anomaly detection with learnable transformations. The key idea is to embed the transformed data into a semantic space such that the transformed data still resemble their untransformed form, while different transformations are easily distinguishable. Extensive experiments on time series demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches in the one-vs.-rest setting and is competitive in the more challenging n-vs.-rest anomaly detection task. On tabular datasets from the medical and cyber-security domains, our method learns domain-specific transformations and detects anomalies more accurately than previous work.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been transforming the practice of drug discovery in the past decade. Various AI techniques have been used in a wide range of applications, such as virtual screening and drug design. In this survey, we first give an overview on drug discovery and discuss related applications, which can be reduced to two major tasks, i.e., molecular property prediction and molecule generation. We then discuss common data resources, molecule representations and benchmark platforms. Furthermore, to summarize the progress of AI in drug discovery, we present the relevant AI techniques including model architectures and learning paradigms in the papers surveyed. We expect that this survey will serve as a guide for researchers who are interested in working at the interface of artificial intelligence and drug discovery. We also provide a GitHub repository (https://github.com/dengjianyuan/Survey_AI_Drug_Discovery) with the collection of papers and codes, if applicable, as a learning resource, which is regularly updated.\n",
      "Given a trained network, how can we accelerate it to meet efficiency needs for deployment on particular hardware? The commonly used hardware-aware network compression techniques address this question with pruning, kernel fusion, quantization and lowering precision. However, these approaches do not change the underlying network operations. In this paper, we propose hardware-aware network transformation (HANT), which accelerates a network by replacing inefficient operations with more efficient alternatives using a neural architecture search like approach. HANT tackles the problem in two phase: In the first phase, a large number of alternative operations per every layer of the teacher model is trained using layer-wise feature map distillation. In the second phase, the combinatorial selection of efficient operations is relaxed to an integer optimization problem that can be solved in a few seconds. We extend HANT with kernel fusion and quantization to improve throughput even further. Our experimental results on accelerating the EfficientNet family show that HANT can accelerate them by up to 3.6x with <0.4% drop in the top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. When comparing the same latency level, HANT can accelerate EfficientNet-B4 to the same latency as EfficientNet-B1 while having 3% higher accuracy. We examine a large pool of operations, up to 197 per layer, and we provide insights into the selected operations and final architectures.\n",
      "Many reinforcement learning (RL) agents require a large amount of experience to solve tasks. We propose Contrastive BERT for RL (CoBERL), an agent that combines a new contrastive loss and a hybrid LSTM-transformer architecture to tackle the challenge of improving data efficiency. CoBERL enables efficient, robust learning from pixels across a wide range of domains. We use bidirectional masked prediction in combination with a generalization of recent contrastive methods to learn better representations for transformers in RL, without the need of hand engineered data augmentations. We find that CoBERL consistently improves performance across the full Atari suite, a set of control tasks and a challenging 3D environment.\n",
      "Real-time surgical phase recognition is a fundamental task in modern operating rooms. Previous works tackle this task relying on architectures arranged in spatio-temporal order, however, the supportive benefits of intermediate spatial features are not considered. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time in surgical workflow analysis, Transformer to reconsider the ignored complementary effects of spatial and temporal features for accurate surgical phase recognition. Our hybrid embedding aggregation Transformer fuses cleverly designed spatial and temporal embeddings by allowing for active queries based on spatial information from temporal embedding sequences. More importantly, our framework processes the hybrid embeddings in parallel to achieve a high inference speed. Our method is thoroughly validated on two large surgical video datasets, i.e., Cholec80 and M2CAI16 Challenge datasets, and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches at a processing speed of 91 fps.\n",
      "Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications, such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption planning. This paper studies the \\textit{long-term forecasting} problem of time series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies. Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information utilization bottleneck. Towards these challenges, we propose Autoformer as a novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We go beyond the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy, traffic, economics, weather and disease.\n",
      "Deep learning has advanced from fully connected architectures to structured models organized into components, e.g., the transformer composed of positional elements, modular architectures divided into slots, and graph neural nets made up of nodes. In structured models, an interesting question is how to conduct dynamic and possibly sparse communication among the separate components. Here, we explore the hypothesis that restricting the transmitted information among components to discrete representations is a beneficial bottleneck. The motivating intuition is human language in which communication occurs through discrete symbols. Even though individuals have different understandings of what a \"cat\" is based on their specific experiences, the shared discrete token makes it possible for communication among individuals to be unimpeded by individual differences in internal representation. To discretize the values of concepts dynamically communicated among specialist components, we extend the quantization mechanism from the Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder to multi-headed discretization with shared codebooks and use it for discrete-valued neural communication (DVNC). Our experiments show that DVNC substantially improves systematic generalization in a variety of architectures -- transformers, modular architectures, and graph neural networks. We also show that the DVNC is robust to the choice of hyperparameters, making the method very useful in practice. Moreover, we establish a theoretical justification of our discretization process, proving that it has the ability to increase noise robustness and reduce the underlying dimensionality of the model.\n",
      "Graph convolutional networks are becoming indispensable for deep learning from graph-structured data. Most of the existing graph convolutional networks share two big shortcomings. First, they are essentially low-pass filters, thus the potentially useful middle and high frequency band of graph signals are ignored. Second, the bandwidth of existing graph convolutional filters is fixed. Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function. In reality, we are uncertain about whether we should retain or cut off the frequency at a certain point unless we have expert domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose Automatic Graph Convolutional Networks (AutoGCN) to capture the full spectrum of graph signals and automatically update the bandwidth of graph convolutional filters. While it is based on graph spectral theory, our AutoGCN is also localized in space and has a spatial form. Experimental results show that AutoGCN achieves significant improvement over baseline methods which only work as low-pass filters.\n",
      "Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are a class of combinatorial problems with wide practical applications. While previous heuristic or learning-based works achieve decent solutions on small problem instances of up to 100 customers, their performance does not scale to large problems. This article presents a novel learning-augmented local search algorithm to solve large-scale VRP. The method iteratively improves the solution by identifying appropriate subproblems and $\\textit{delegating}$ their improvement to a black box subsolver. At each step, we leverage spatial locality to consider only a linear number of subproblems, rather than exponential. We frame subproblem selection as a regression problem and train a Transformer on a generated training set of problem instances. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a speed-up of up to 15 times over strong baselines, on VRPs with sizes ranging from 500 to 3000.\n",

Additional features include cropping, rotating and saving as well. All these functions and features, when implemented step by step, results in a complete scanning application. The applied procedure involves the following steps: Finding contours, applying Perspective transform and brightening the image, Adaptive Thresholding and applying filters for noise cancellation, and Rotation features and perspective transform for a special cropping algorithm. The described technique is implemented on various samples.\n",
      "Video transformers have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to 3D CNNs for video understanding. However, due to their large number of parameters and reduced inductive biases, these models require supervised pretraining on large-scale image datasets to achieve top performance. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining of video transformers on video-only datasets can lead to action recognition results that are on par or better than those obtained with supervised pretraining on large-scale image datasets, even massive ones such as ImageNet-21K. Since transformer-based models are effective at capturing dependencies over extended temporal spans, we propose a simple learning procedure that forces the model to match a long-term view to a short-term view of the same video. Our approach, named Long-Short Temporal Contrastive Learning (LSTCL), enables video transformers to learn an effective clip-level representation by predicting temporal context captured from a longer temporal extent. To demonstrate the generality of our findings, we implement and validate our approach under three different self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks (MoCo v3, BYOL, SimSiam) using two distinct video-transformer architectures, including an improved variant of the Swin Transformer augmented with space-time attention. We conduct a thorough ablation study and show that LSTCL achieves competitive performance on multiple video benchmarks and represents a convincing alternative to supervised image-based pretraining.\n",
      "Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a public health crisis costing the US billions of dollars annually in healthcare, lost workplace productivity, and crime. Analyzing longitudinal healthcare data is critical in addressing many real-world problems in healthcare. Leveraging the real-world longitudinal healthcare data, we propose a novel multi-stream transformer model called MUPOD for OUD identification. MUPOD is designed to simultaneously analyze multiple types of healthcare data streams, such as medications and diagnoses, by attending to segments within and across these data streams. Our model tested on the data from 392,492 patients with long-term back pain problems showed significantly better performance than the traditional models and recently developed deep learning models.\n",
      "Hyperspectral (HS) images are characterized by approximately contiguous spectral information, enabling the fine identification of materials by capturing subtle spectral discrepancies. Owing to their excellent locally contextual modeling ability, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proven to be a powerful feature extractor in HS image classification. However, CNNs fail to mine and represent the sequence attributes of spectral signatures well due to the limitations of their inherent network backbone. To solve this issue, we rethink HS image classification from a sequential perspective with transformers, and propose a novel backbone network called \\ul{SpectralFormer}. Beyond band-wise representations in classic transformers, SpectralFormer is capable of learning spectrally local sequence information from neighboring bands of HS images, yielding group-wise spectral embeddings. More significantly, to reduce the possibility of losing valuable information in the layer-wise propagation process, we devise a cross-layer skip connection to convey memory-like components from shallow to deep layers by adaptively learning to fuse \"soft\" residuals across layers. It is worth noting that the proposed SpectralFormer is a highly flexible backbone network, which can be applicable to both pixel- and patch-wise inputs. We evaluate the classification performance of the proposed SpectralFormer on three HS datasets by conducting extensive experiments, showing the superiority over classic transformers and achieving a significant improvement in comparison with state-of-the-art backbone networks. The codes of this work will be available at \\url{https://sites.google.com/view/danfeng-hong} for the sake of reproducibility.\n",
      "Due to a high heterogeneity in pose and size and to a limited number of available data, segmentation of pediatric images is challenging for deep learning methods. In this work, we propose a new CNN architecture that is pose and scale invariant thanks to the use of Spatial Transformer Network (STN). Our architecture is composed of three sequential modules that are estimated together during training: (i) a regression module to estimate a similarity matrix to normalize the input image to a reference one; (ii) a differentiable module to find the region of interest to segment; (iii) a segmentation module, based on the popular UNet architecture, to delineate the object. Unlike the original UNet, which strives to learn a complex mapping, including pose and scale variations, from a finite training dataset, our segmentation module learns a simpler mapping focusing on images with normalized pose and size. Furthermore, the use of an automatic bounding box detection through STN allows saving time and especially memory, while keeping similar performance. We test the proposed method in kidney and renal tumor segmentation on abdominal pediatric CT scanners. Results indicate that the estimated STN homogenization of size and pose accelerates the segmentation (25h), compared to standard data-augmentation (33h), while obtaining a similar quality for the kidney (88.01\\% of Dice score) and improving the renal tumor delineation (from 85.52\\% to 87.12\\%).\n",
      "Homography estimation is an important task in computer vision, such as image stitching, video stabilization, and camera calibration. Traditional homography estimation methods heavily depend on the quantity and distribution of feature points, leading to poor robustness in textureless scenes. The learning solutions, on the contrary, try to learn robust deep features but demonstrate unsatisfying performance in the scenes of low overlap rates. In this paper, we address the two problems simultaneously, by designing a contextual correlation layer, which can capture the long-range correlation on feature maps and flexibly be bridged in a learning framework. In addition, considering that a single homography can not represent the complex spatial transformation in depth-varying images with parallax, we propose to predict multi-grid homography from global to local. Moreover, we equip our network with depth perception capability, by introducing a novel depth-aware shape-preserved loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art solutions in the synthetic benchmark dataset and real-world dataset. The codes and models will be available at https://github.com/nie-lang/Multi-Grid-Deep-Homogarphy.\n",
      "Deep convolutional neural networks, assisted by architectural design strategies, make extensive use of data augmentation techniques and layers with a high number of feature maps to embed object transformations. That is highly inefficient and for large datasets implies a massive redundancy of features detectors. Even though capsules networks are still in their infancy, they constitute a promising solution to extend current convolutional networks and endow artificial visual perception with a process to encode more efficiently all feature affine transformations. Indeed, a properly working capsule network should theoretically achieve higher results with a considerably lower number of parameters count due to intrinsic capability to generalize to novel viewpoints. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to this relevant aspect. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of capsule networks and, pushing their capacity to the limits with an extreme architecture with barely 160K parameters, we prove that the proposed architecture is still able to achieve state-of-the-art results on three different datasets with only 2% of the original CapsNet parameters. Moreover, we replace dynamic routing with a novel non-iterative, highly parallelizable routing algorithm that can easily cope with a reduced number of capsules. Extensive experimentation with other capsule implementations has proved the effectiveness of our methodology and the capability of capsule networks to efficiently embed visual representations more prone to generalization.\n",
      "In this paper, we study feature cross search as a fundamental primitive in feature engineering. The importance of feature cross search especially for the linear model has been known for a while, with well-known textbook examples. In this problem, the goal is to select a small subset of features, combine them to form a new feature (called the crossed feature) by considering their Cartesian product, and find feature crosses to learn an \\emph{accurate} model. In particular, we study the problem of maximizing a normalized Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the linear model trained on the crossed feature column.   First, we show that it is not possible to provide an $n^{1/\\log\\log n}$-approximation algorithm for this problem unless the exponential time hypothesis fails. This result also rules out the possibility of solving this problem in polynomial time unless $\\mathsf{P}=\\mathsf{NP}$. On the positive side, by assuming the \\naive\\ assumption, we show that there exists a simple greedy $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for this problem. This result is established by relating the AUC to the total variation of the commutator of two probability measures and showing that the total variation of the commutator is monotone and submodular. To show this, we relate the submodularity of this function to the positive semi-definiteness of a corresponding kernel matrix. Then, we use Bochner's theorem to prove the positive semi-definiteness by showing that its inverse Fourier transform is non-negative everywhere. Our techniques and structural results might be of independent interest.\n",
      "Relational databases are the de facto standard for storing and querying structured data, and extracting insights from structured data requires advanced analytics. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved super-human prediction performance in particular data types, e.g., images. However, existing DNNs may not produce meaningful results when applied to structured data. The reason is that there are correlations and dependencies across combinations of attribute values in a table, and these do not follow simple additive patterns that can be easily mimicked by a DNN. The number of possible such cross features is combinatorial, making them computationally prohibitive to model. Furthermore, the deployment of learning models in real-world applications has also highlighted the need for interpretability, especially for high-stakes applications, which remains another issue of concern to DNNs.   In this paper, we present ARM-Net, an adaptive relation modeling network tailored for structured data, and a lightweight framework ARMOR based on ARM-Net for relational data analytics. The key idea is to model feature interactions with cross features selectively and dynamically, by first transforming the input features into exponential space, and then determining the interaction order and interaction weights adaptively for each cross feature. We propose a novel sparse attention mechanism to dynamically generate the interaction weights given the input tuple, so that we can explicitly model cross features of arbitrary orders with noisy features filtered selectively. Then during model inference, ARM-Net can specify the cross features being used for each prediction for higher accuracy and better interpretability. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ARM-Net consistently outperforms existing models and provides more interpretable predictions for data-driven decision making.\n",
      "Transformer is a new kind of neural architecture which encodes the input data as powerful features via the attention mechanism. Basically, the visual transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN Transformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g., 16$\\times$16) as \"visual sentences\" and present to further divide them into smaller patches (e.g., 4$\\times$4) as \"visual words\". The attention of each word will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with negligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be aggregated to enhance the representation ability. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TNT architecture, e.g., we achieve an $81.5%$ top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet, which is about $1.7%$ higher than that of the state-of-the-art visual transformer with similar computational cost. The PyTorch code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/CV-Backbones/tree/master/tnt_pytorch, and the MindSpore code is at https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/tree/master/model_zoo/research/cv/TNT.\n",
      "Temperature monitoring during the life time of heat source components in engineering systems becomes essential to guarantee the normal work and the working life of these components. However, prior methods, which mainly use the interpolate estimation to reconstruct the temperature field from limited monitoring points, require large amounts of temperature tensors for an accurate estimation. This may decrease the availability and reliability of the system and sharply increase the monitoring cost. To solve this problem, this work develops a novel physics-informed deep reversible regression models for temperature field reconstruction of heat-source systems (TFR-HSS), which can better reconstruct the temperature field with limited monitoring points unsupervisedly. First, we define the TFR-HSS task mathematically, and numerically model the task, and hence transform the task as an image-to-image regression problem. Then this work develops the deep reversible regression model which can better learn the physical information, especially over the boundary. Finally, considering the physical characteristics of heat conduction as well as the boundary conditions, this work proposes the physics-informed reconstruction loss including four training losses and jointly learns the deep surrogate model with these losses unsupervisedly. Experimental studies have conducted over typical two-dimensional heat-source systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",
      "Adaptive optimization methods have been widely used in deep learning. They scale the learning rates adaptively according to the past gradient, which has been shown to be effective to accelerate the convergence. However, they suffer from poor generalization performance compared with SGD. Recent studies point that smoothing exponential gradient noise leads to generalization degeneration phenomenon. Inspired by this, we propose AdaL, with a transformation on the original gradient. AdaL accelerates the convergence by amplifying the gradient in the early stage, as well as dampens the oscillation and stabilizes the optimization by shrinking the gradient later. Such modification alleviates the smoothness of gradient noise, which produces better generalization performance. We have theoretically proved the convergence of AdaL and demonstrated its effectiveness on several benchmarks.\n",
      "Normalizing flows are an essential alternative to GANs for generative modelling, which can be optimized directly on the maximum likelihood of the dataset. They also allow computation of the exact latent vector corresponding to an image since they are composed of invertible transformations. However, the requirement of invertibility of the transformation prevents standard and expressive neural network models such as CNNs from being directly used. Emergent convolutions were proposed to construct an invertible 3$\\times$3 CNN layer using a pair of masked CNN layers, making them inefficient. We study conditions such that 3$\\times$3 CNNs are invertible, allowing them to construct expressive normalizing flows. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a padded CNN for it to be invertible. Our conditions for invertibility are simple, can easily be maintained during the training process. Since we require only a single CNN layer for every effective invertible CNN layer, our approach is more efficient than emerging convolutions. We also proposed a coupling method, Quad-coupling. We benchmark our approach and show similar performance results to emergent convolutions while improving the model's efficiency.\n",
      "Making predictions in a robust way is not easy for nonlinear systems. In this work, a neural network computing framework, i.e., a spatiotemporal convolutional network (STCN), was developed to efficiently and accurately render a multistep-ahead prediction of a time series by employing a spatial-temporal information (STI) transformation. The STCN combines the advantages of both the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the STI equation, which maps the high-dimensional/spatial data to the future temporal values of a target variable, thus naturally providing the prediction of the target variable. From the observed variables, the STCN also infers the causal factors of the target variable in the sense of Granger causality, which are in turn selected as effective spatial information to improve the prediction robustness. The STCN was successfully applied to both benchmark systems and real-world datasets, all of which show superior and robust performance in multistep-ahead prediction, even when the data were perturbed by noise. From both theoretical and computational viewpoints, the STCN has great potential in practical applications in artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning fields as a model-free method based only on the observed data, and also opens a new way to explore the observed high-dimensional data in a dynamical manner for machine learning.\n",
      "Digital gigapixel whole slide image (WSI) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, and automated WSI analysis is key for computer-aided diagnosis. Currently, analyzing the integrated descriptor of probabilities or feature maps from massive local patches encoded by ResNet classifier is the main manner for WSI-level prediction. Feature representations of the sparse and tiny lesion cells in cervical slides, however, are still challengeable for the under-promoted upstream encoders, while the unused spatial representations of cervical cells are the available features to supply the semantics analysis. As well as patches sampling with overlap and repetitive processing incur the inefficiency and the unpredictable side effect. This study designs a novel inline connection network (InCNet) by enriching the multi-scale connectivity to build the lightweight model named You Only Look Cytopathology Once (YOLCO) with the additional supervision of spatial information. The proposed model allows the input size enlarged to megapixel that can stitch the WSI without any overlap by the average repeats decreased from $10^3\\sim10^4$ to $10^1\\sim10^2$ for collecting features and predictions at two scales. Based on Transformer for classifying the integrated multi-scale multi-task features, the experimental results appear $0.872$ AUC score better and $2.51\\times$ faster than the best conventional method in WSI classification on multicohort datasets of 2,019 slides from four scanning devices.\n",
      "We provide a probabilistic interpretation of attention and show that the standard dot-product attention in transformers is a special case of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference. The proposed approach suggests the use of Expectation Maximization algorithms for online adaptation of key and value model parameters. This approach is useful for cases in which external agents, e.g., annotators, provide inference-time information about the correct values of some tokens, e.g, the semantic category of some pixels, and we need for this new information to propagate to other tokens in a principled manner. We illustrate the approach on an interactive semantic segmentation task in which annotators and models collaborate online to improve annotation efficiency. Using standard benchmarks, we observe that key adaptation boosts model performance ($\\sim10\\%$ mIoU) in the low feedback regime and value propagation improves model responsiveness in the high feedback regime. A PyTorch layer implementation of our probabilistic attention model will be made publicly available here: https://github.com/apple/ml-probabilistic-attention.\n",
      "Real-world scenarios often require the anticipation of object interactions in unknown future, which would assist the decision-making process of both humans and agents. To meet this challenge, we present a new task named Visual Relationship Forecasting (VRF) in videos to explore the prediction of visual relationships in a reasoning manner. Specifically, given a subject-object pair with H existing frames, VRF aims to predict their future interactions for the next T frames without visual evidence. To evaluate the VRF task, we introduce two video datasets named VRF-AG and VRF-VidOR, with a series of spatio-temporally localized visual relation annotations in a video. These two datasets densely annotate 13 and 35 visual relationships in 1923 and 13447 video clips, respectively. In addition, we present a novel Graph Convolutional Transformer (GCT) framework, which captures both object-level and frame-level dependencies by spatio-temporal Graph Convolution Network and Transformer. Experimental results on both VRF-AG and VRF-VidOR datasets demonstrate that GCT outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence modelling methods on visual relationship forecasting.\n",
      "A generic video summary is an abridged version of a video that conveys the whole story and features the most important scenes. Yet the importance of scenes in a video is often subjective, and users should have the option of customizing the summary by using natural language to specify what is important to them. Further, existing models for fully automatic generic summarization have not exploited available language models, which can serve as an effective prior for saliency. This work introduces CLIP-It, a single framework for addressing both generic and query-focused video summarization, typically approached separately in the literature. We propose a language-guided multimodal transformer that learns to score frames in a video based on their importance relative to one another and their correlation with a user-defined query (for query-focused summarization) or an automatically generated dense video caption (for generic video summarization). Our model can be extended to the unsupervised setting by training without ground-truth supervision. We outperform baselines and prior work by a significant margin on both standard video summarization datasets (TVSum and SumMe) and a query-focused video summarization dataset (QFVS). Particularly, we achieve large improvements in the transfer setting, attesting to our method's strong generalization capabilities.\n",
      "Recent advances in self-attention and pure multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) models for vision have shown great potential in achieving promising performance with fewer inductive biases. These models are generally based on learning interaction among spatial locations from raw data. The complexity of self-attention and MLP grows quadratically as the image size increases, which makes these models hard to scale up when high-resolution features are required. In this paper, we present the Global Filter Network (GFNet), a conceptually simple yet computationally efficient architecture, that learns long-term spatial dependencies in the frequency domain with log-linear complexity. Our architecture replaces the self-attention layer in vision transformers with three key operations: a 2D discrete Fourier transform, an element-wise multiplication between frequency-domain features and learnable global filters, and a 2D inverse Fourier transform. We exhibit favorable accuracy/complexity trade-offs of our models on both ImageNet and downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate that GFNet can be a very competitive alternative to transformer-style models and CNNs in efficiency, generalization ability and robustness.

      "It is hard to directly implement Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large scaled graphs. Besides of existed neighbor sampling techniques, scalable methods decoupling graph convolutions and other learnable transformations into preprocessing and post classifier allow normal minibatch training. By replacing redundant concatenation operation with attention mechanism in SIGN, we propose Scalable and Adaptive Graph Neural Networks (SAGN). SAGN can adaptively gather neighborhood information among different hops. To further improve scalable models on semi-supervised learning tasks, we propose Self-Label-Enhance (SLE) framework combining self-training approach and label propagation in depth. We add base model with a scalable node label module. Then we iteratively train models and enhance train set in several stages. To generate input of node label module, we directly apply label propagation based on one-hot encoded label vectors without inner random masking. We find out that empirically the label leakage has been effectively alleviated after graph convolutions. The hard pseudo labels in enhanced train set participate in label propagation with true labels. Experiments on both inductive and transductive datasets demonstrate that, compared with other sampling-based and sampling-free methods, SAGN achieves better or comparable results and SLE can further improve performance.\n",
      "Reconstructing the scene of robotic surgery from the stereo endoscopic video is an important and promising topic in surgical data science, which potentially supports many applications such as surgical visual perception, robotic surgery education and intra-operative context awareness. However, current methods are mostly restricted to reconstructing static anatomy assuming no tissue deformation, tool occlusion and de-occlusion, and camera movement. However, these assumptions are not always satisfied in minimal invasive robotic surgeries. In this work, we present an efficient reconstruction pipeline for highly dynamic surgical scenes that runs at 28 fps. Specifically, we design a transformer-based stereoscopic depth perception for efficient depth estimation and a light-weight tool segmentor to handle tool occlusion. After that, a dynamic reconstruction algorithm which can estimate the tissue deformation and camera movement, and aggregate the information over time is proposed for surgical scene reconstruction. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on two datasets, the public Hamlyn Centre Endoscopic Video Dataset and our in-house DaVinci robotic surgery dataset. The results demonstrate that our method can recover the scene obstructed by the surgical tool and handle the movement of camera in realistic surgical scenarios effectively at real-time speed.\n",
      "We introduce the GANformer, a novel and efficient type of transformer, and explore it for the task of visual generative modeling. The network employs a bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image, while maintaining computation of linear efficiency, that can readily scale to high-resolution synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the refinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of compositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of the successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate the model's strength and robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor scenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality and diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efficiency. Further qualitative and quantitative experiments offer us an insight into the model's inner workings, revealing improved interpretability and stronger disentanglement, and illustrating the benefits and efficacy of our approach. An implementation of the model is available at https://github.com/dorarad/gansformer.\n",
      "We investigate the capability of a transformer pretrained on natural language to generalize to other modalities with minimal finetuning -- in particular, without finetuning of the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual blocks. We consider such a model, which we call a Frozen Pretrained Transformer (FPT), and study finetuning it on a variety of sequence classification tasks spanning numerical computation, vision, and protein fold prediction. In contrast to prior works which investigate finetuning on the same modality as the pretraining dataset, we show that pretraining on natural language can improve performance and compute efficiency on non-language downstream tasks. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the architecture, comparing the performance of a random initialized transformer to a random LSTM. Combining the two insights, we find language-pretrained transformers can obtain strong performance on a variety of non-language tasks.\n",
      "Dimension reduction (DR) aims to learn low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data with the preservation of essential information. In the context of manifold learning, we define that the representation after information-lossless DR preserves the topological and geometric properties of data manifolds formally, and propose a novel two-stage DR method, called invertible manifold learning (inv-ML) to bridge the gap between theoretical information-lossless and practical DR. The first stage includes a homeomorphic sparse coordinate transformation to learn low-dimensional representations without destroying topology and a local isometry constraint to preserve local geometry. In the second stage, a linear compression is implemented for the trade-off between the target dimension and the incurred information loss in excessive DR scenarios. Experiments are conducted on seven datasets with a neural network implementation of inv-ML, called i-ML-Enc. Empirically, i-ML-Enc achieves invertible DR in comparison with typical existing methods as well as reveals the characteristics of the learned manifolds. Through latent space interpolation on real-world datasets, we find that the reliability of tangent space approximated by the local neighborhood is the key to the success of manifold-based DR algorithms.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many graph-based tasks. Much work is dedicated to empowering GNNs with the adaptive locality ability, which enables measuring the importance of neighboring nodes to the target node by a node-specific mechanism. However, the current node-specific mechanisms are deficient in distinguishing the importance of nodes in the topology structure. We believe that the structural importance of neighboring nodes is closely related to their importance in aggregation. In this paper, we introduce discrete graph curvature (the Ricci curvature) to quantify the strength of structural connection of pairwise nodes. And we propose Curvature Graph Neural Network (CGNN), which effectively improves the adaptive locality ability of GNNs by leveraging the structural property of graph curvature. To improve the adaptability of curvature to various datasets, we explicitly transform curvature into the weights of neighboring nodes by the necessary Negative Curvature Processing Module and Curvature Normalization Module. Then, we conduct numerous experiments on various synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show that CGNN effectively exploits the topology structure information, and the performance is improved significantly. CGNN outperforms the baselines on 5 dense node classification benchmark datasets. This study deepens the understanding of how to utilize advanced topology information and assign the importance of neighboring nodes from the perspective of graph curvature and encourages us to bridge the gap between graph theory and neural networks.\n",
      "Quite a few people in the world have to stay under permanent surveillance for health reasons; they include diabetic people or people with some other chronic conditions, the elderly and the disabled.These groups may face heightened risk of having life-threatening falls or of being struck by a syncope. Due to limited availability of resources a substantial part of people at risk can not receive necessary monitoring and thus are exposed to excessive danger. Nowadays, this problem is usually solved via applying Human Activity Recognition (HAR) methods. HAR is a perspective and fast-paced Data Science field, which has a wide range of application areas such as healthcare, sport, security etc. However, the currently techniques of recognition are markedly lacking in accuracy, hence, the present paper suggests a highly accurate method for human activity classification. Wepropose a new workflow to address the HAR problem and evaluate it on the UniMiB SHAR dataset, which consists of the accelerometer signals. The model we suggest is based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Wavelet transform localizes signal features both in time and frequency domains and after that a CNN extracts these features and recognizes activity. It is also worth noting that CWT converts 1D accelerometer signal into 2D images and thus enables to obtain better results as 2D networks have a significantly higher predictive capacity. In the course of the work we build a convolutional neural network and vary such model parameters as number of spatial axes, number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, image size, type of mother wavelet, the order of zero moment of mother wavelet etc. Besides, we also apply models with residual blocks which resulted in significantly higher metric values. Finally, we succeed to reach 99.26 % accuracy and it is a worthy performance for this problem.\n",
      "Reliable weather forecasting is of great importance in science, business and society. The best performing data-driven models for weather prediction tasks rely on recurrent or convolutional neural networks, where some of which incorporate attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce a new model based on the Transformer architecture for weather forecasting. The proposed Tensorial Encoder Transformer (TENT) model is equipped with tensorial attention and thus it exploits the spatiotemporal structure of weather data by processing it in multidimensional tensorial format. We show that compared to the encoder part of the original transformer and 3D convolutional neural networks, the proposed TENT model can better model the underlying complex pattern of weather data for the studied temperature prediction task. Experiments on two real-life weather datasets are performed. The datasets consist of historical measurements from USA, Canada and European cities. The first dataset contains hourly measurements of weather attributes for 30 cities in USA and Canada from October 2012 to November 2017. The second dataset contains daily measurements of weather attributes of 18 cities across Europe from May 2005 to April 2020. We use attention scores calculated from our attention mechanism to shed light on the decision-making process of our model and have insight knowledge on the most important cities for the task.\n",
      "Data augmentation is a powerful technique for improving the performance of the few-shot classification task. It generates more samples as supplements, and then this task can be transformed into a common supervised learning issue for solution. However, most mainstream data augmentation based approaches only consider the single modality information, which leads to the low diversity and quality of generated features. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal data augmentation approach named Dizygotic Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (DCVAE) for addressing the aforementioned issue. DCVAE conducts feature synthesis via pairing two Conditional Variational AutoEncoders (CVAEs) with the same seed but different modality conditions in a dizygotic symbiosis manner. Subsequently, the generated features of two CVAEs are adaptively combined to yield the final feature, which can be converted back into its paired conditions while ensuring these conditions are consistent with the original conditions not only in representation but also in function. DCVAE essentially provides a new idea of data augmentation in various multi-modal scenarios by exploiting the complement of different modality prior information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our work achieves state-of-the-art performances on miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS and CUB datasets, and is able to work well in the partial modality absence case.\n",

      "Solving partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is critical when applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to real-world robotics problems, where agents have an incomplete view of the world. We present graph convolutional memory (GCM) for solving POMDPs using deep reinforcement learning. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, GCM embeds domain-specific priors into the memory recall process via a knowledge graph. By encapsulating priors in the graph, GCM adapts to specific tasks but remains applicable to any DRL task. Using graph convolutions, GCM extracts hierarchical graph features, analogous to image features in a convolutional neural network (CNN).

      "Hypergraphs are used to model higher-order interactions amongst agents and there exist many practically relevant instances of hypergraph datasets. To enable efficient processing of hypergraph-structured data, several hypergraph neural network platforms have been proposed for learning hypergraph properties and structure, with a special focus on node classification. However, almost all existing methods use heuristic propagation rules and offer suboptimal performance on many datasets. We propose AllSet, a new hypergraph neural network paradigm that represents a highly general framework for (hyper)graph neural networks and for the first time implements hypergraph neural network layers as compositions of two multiset functions that can be efficiently learned for each task and each dataset. Furthermore, AllSet draws on new connections between hypergraph neural networks and recent advances in deep learning of multiset functions. In particular, the proposed architecture utilizes Deep Sets and Set Transformer architectures that allow for significant modeling flexibility and offer high expressive power. To evaluate the performance of AllSet, we conduct the most extensive experiments to date involving ten known benchmarking datasets and three newly curated datasets that represent significant challenges for hypergraph node classification. The results demonstrate that AllSet has the unique ability to consistently either match or outperform all other hypergraph neural networks across the tested datasets. Our implementation and dataset will be released upon acceptance.\n",
      "The vision community is witnessing a modeling shift from CNNs to Transformers, where pure Transformer architectures have attained top accuracy on the major video recognition benchmarks. These video models are all built on Transformer layers that globally connect patches across the spatial and temporal dimensions. In this paper, we instead advocate an inductive bias of locality in video Transformers, which leads to a better speed-accuracy trade-off compared to previous approaches which compute self-attention globally even with spatial-temporal factorization. The locality of the proposed video architecture is realized by adapting the Swin Transformer designed for the image domain, while continuing to leverage the power of pre-trained image models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a broad range of video recognition benchmarks, including on action recognition (84.9 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 and 86.1 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-600 with ~20x less pre-training data and ~3x smaller model size) and temporal modeling (69.6 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something v2).

      "We introduce a framework that abstracts Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. This allows us to draw upon the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture, and associated advances in language modeling such as GPT-x and BERT. In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.\n",
      "Attentional mechanisms are order-invariant. Positional encoding is a crucial component to allow attention-based deep model architectures such as Transformer to address sequences or images where the position of information matters. In this paper, we propose a novel positional encoding method based on learnable Fourier features. Instead of hard-coding each position as a token or a vector, we represent each position, which can be multi-dimensional, as a trainable encoding based on learnable Fourier feature mapping, modulated with a multi-layer perceptron. The representation is particularly advantageous for a spatial multi-dimensional position, e.g., pixel positions on an image, where $L_2$ distances or more complex positional relationships need to be captured. Our experiments based on several public benchmark tasks show that our learnable Fourier feature representation for multi-dimensional positional encoding outperforms existing methods by both improving the accuracy and allowing faster convergence.\n",
      "Recently, visual Transformer (ViT) and its following works abandon the convolution and exploit the self-attention operation, attaining a comparable or even higher accuracy than CNNs. More recently, MLP-Mixer abandons both the convolution and the self-attention operation, proposing an architecture containing only MLP layers. To achieve cross-patch communications, it devises an additional token-mixing MLP besides the channel-mixing MLP. It achieves promising results when training on an extremely large-scale dataset. But it cannot achieve as outstanding performance as its CNN and ViT counterparts when training on medium-scale datasets such as ImageNet1K and ImageNet21K. The performance drop of MLP-Mixer motivates us to rethink the token-mixing MLP. We discover that the token-mixing MLP is a variant of the depthwise convolution with a global reception field and spatial-specific configuration. But the global reception field and the spatial-specific property make token-mixing MLP prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel pure MLP architecture, spatial-shift MLP (S$^2$-MLP). Different from MLP-Mixer, our S$^2$-MLP only contains channel-mixing MLP. We utilize a spatial-shift operation for communications between patches. It has a local reception field and is spatial-agnostic. It is parameter-free and efficient for computation. The proposed S$^2$-MLP attains higher recognition accuracy than MLP-Mixer when training on ImageNet-1K dataset. Meanwhile, S$^2$-MLP accomplishes as excellent performance as ViT on ImageNet-1K dataset with considerably simpler architecture and fewer FLOPs and parameters.\n",
      "Biological systems perceive the world by simultaneously processing high-dimensional inputs from modalities as diverse as vision, audition, touch, proprioception, etc. The perception models used in deep learning on the other hand are designed for individual modalities, often relying on domain-specific assumptions such as the local grid structures exploited by virtually all existing vision models. These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but also lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the Perceiver - a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model leverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into a tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We show that this architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong, specialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images, point clouds, audio, video, and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance comparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without 2D convolutions by directly attending to 50,000 pixels. It is also competitive in all modalities in AudioSet.\n",
      "Deep neural networks are behind many of the recent successes in machine learning applications. However, these models can produce overconfident decisions while encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) examples or making a wrong prediction. This inconsistent predictive confidence limits the integration of independently-trained learning models into a larger system. This paper introduces separable concept learning framework to realistically measure the performance of classifiers in presence of OOD examples. In this setup, several instances of a classifier are trained on different parts of a partition of the set of classes. Later, the performance of the combination of these models is evaluated on a separate test set. Unlike current OOD detection techniques, this framework does not require auxiliary OOD datasets and does not separate classification from detection performance. Furthermore, we present a new strong baseline for more consistent predictive confidence in deep models, called fitted ensembles, where overconfident predictions are rectified by transformed versions of the original classification task. Fitted ensembles can naturally detect OOD examples without requiring auxiliary data by observing contradicting predictions among its components. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet show fitted ensemble significantly outperform conventional ensembles on OOD examples and are possible to scale.\n",
      "Chinese character recognition has attracted much research interest due to its wide applications. Although it has been studied for many years, some issues in this field have not been completely resolved yet, e.g. the zero-shot problem. Previous character-based and radical-based methods have not fundamentally addressed the zero-shot problem since some characters or radicals in test sets may not appear in training sets under a data-hungry condition. Inspired by the fact that humans can generalize to know how to write characters unseen before if they have learned stroke orders of some characters, we propose a stroke-based method by decomposing each character into a sequence of strokes, which are the most basic units of Chinese characters. However, we observe that there is a one-to-many relationship between stroke sequences and Chinese characters. To tackle this challenge, we employ a matching-based strategy to transform the predicted stroke sequence to a specific character. We evaluate the proposed method on handwritten characters, printed artistic characters, and scene characters. The experimental results validate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods on both character zero-shot and radical zero-shot tasks. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily generalized to other languages whose characters can be decomposed into strokes.\n",
      "Large machine learning models achieve unprecedented performance on various tasks and have evolved as the go-to technique. However, deploying these compute and memory hungry models on resource constraint environments poses new challenges. In this work, we propose mathematically provable Representer Sketch, a concise set of count arrays that can approximate the inference procedure with simple hashing computations and aggregations. Representer Sketch builds upon the popular Representer Theorem from kernel literature, hence the name, providing a generic fundamental alternative to the problem of efficient inference that goes beyond the popular approach such as quantization, iterative pruning and knowledge distillation. A neural network function is transformed to its weighted kernel density representation, which can be very efficiently estimated with our sketching algorithm. Empirically, we show that Representer Sketch achieves up to 114x reduction in storage requirement and 59x reduction in computation complexity without any drop in accuracy.\n",
      "There has recently been significant interest in training reinforcement learning (RL) agents in vision-based environments. This poses many challenges, such as high dimensionality and potential for observational overfitting through spurious correlations. A promising approach to solve both of these problems is a self-attention bottleneck, which provides a simple and effective framework for learning high performing policies, even in the presence of distractions. However, due to poor scalability of attention architectures, these methods do not scale beyond low resolution visual inputs, using large patches (thus small attention matrices). In this paper we make use of new efficient attention algorithms, recently shown to be highly effective for Transformers, and demonstrate that these new techniques can be applied in the RL setting. This allows our attention-based controllers to scale to larger visual inputs, and facilitate the use of smaller patches, even individual pixels, improving generalization. In addition, we propose a new efficient algorithm approximating softmax attention with what we call hybrid random features, leveraging the theory of angular kernels. We show theoretically and empirically that hybrid random features is a promising approach when using attention for vision-based RL.\n",
      "This is a technical report for CVPR 2021 AliProducts Challenge. AliProducts Challenge is a competition proposed for studying the large-scale and fine-grained commodity image recognition problem encountered by worldleading ecommerce companies. The large-scale product recognition simultaneously meets the challenge of noisy annotations, imbalanced (long-tailed) data distribution and fine-grained classification. In our solution, we adopt stateof-the-art model architectures of both CNNs and Transformer, including ResNeSt, EfficientNetV2, and DeiT. We found that iterative data cleaning, classifier weight normalization, high-resolution finetuning, and test time augmentation are key components to improve the performance of training with the noisy and imbalanced dataset. Finally, we obtain 6.4365% mean class error rate in the leaderboard with our ensemble model.\n",
      "This paper presents a new approach for assembling graph neural networks based on framelet transforms. The latter provides a multi-scale representation for graph-structured data. We decompose an input graph into low-pass and high-pass frequencies coefficients for network training, which then defines a framelet-based graph convolution. The framelet decomposition naturally induces a graph pooling strategy by aggregating the graph feature into low-pass and high-pass spectra, which considers both the feature values and geometry of the graph data and conserves the total information. The graph neural networks with the proposed framelet convolution and pooling achieve state-of-the-art performance in many node and graph prediction tasks. Moreover, we propose shrinkage as a new activation for the framelet convolution, which thresholds high-frequency information at different scales. Compared to ReLU, shrinkage activation improves model performance on denoising and signal compression: noises in both node and structure can be significantly reduced by accurately cutting off the high-pass coefficients from framelet decomposition, and the signal can be compressed to less than half its original size with well-preserved prediction performance.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose an efficient saliency map generation method, called Group score-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Group-CAM), which adopts the \"split-transform-merge\" strategy to generate saliency maps. Specifically, for an input image, the class activations are firstly split into groups. In each group, the sub-activations are summed and de-noised as an initial mask. After that, the initial masks are transformed with meaningful perturbations and then applied to preserve sub-pixels of the input (i.e., masked inputs), which are then fed into the network to calculate the confidence scores. Finally, the initial masks are weighted summed to form the final saliency map, where the weights are confidence scores produced by the masked inputs. Group-CAM is efficient yet effective, which only requires dozens of queries to the network while producing target-related saliency maps. As a result, Group-CAM can be served as an effective data augment trick for fine-tuning the networks. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of Group-CAM on common-used benchmarks, including deletion and insertion tests on ImageNet-1k, and pointing game tests on COCO2017. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Group-CAM achieves better visual performance than the current state-of-the-art explanation approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/wofmanaf/Group-CAM.\n",
      "We present evidence that many common convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for face verification learn functions that are nearly equivalent under rotation. More specifically, we demonstrate that one face verification model's embeddings (i.e. last--layer activations) can be compared directly to another model's embeddings after only a rotation or linear transformation, with little performance penalty. This finding is demonstrated using IJB-C 1:1 verification across the combinations of ten modern off-the-shelf CNN-based face verification models which vary in training dataset, CNN architecture, way of using angular loss, or some combination of the 3, and achieve a mean true accept rate of 0.96 at a false accept rate of 0.01. When instead evaluating embeddings generated from two CNNs, where one CNN's embeddings are mapped with a linear transformation, the mean true accept rate drops to 0.95 using the same verification paradigm. Restricting these linear maps to only perform rotation produces a mean true accept rate of 0.91. These mappings' existence suggests that a common representation is learned by models with variation in training or structure. A discovery such as this likely has broad implications, and we provide an application in which face embeddings can be de-anonymized using a limited number of samples.\n",
      "World models improve a learning agent's ability to efficiently operate in interactive and situated environments. This work focuses on the task of building world models of text-based game environments. Text-based games, or interactive narratives, are reinforcement learning environments in which agents perceive and interact with the world using textual natural language. These environments contain long, multi-step puzzles or quests woven through a world that is filled with hundreds of characters, locations, and objects. Our world model learns to simultaneously: (1) predict changes in the world caused by an agent's actions when representing the world as a knowledge graph; and (2) generate the set of contextually relevant natural language actions required to operate in the world. We frame this task as a Set of Sequences generation problem by exploiting the inherent structure of knowledge graphs and actions and introduce both a transformer-based multi-task architecture and a loss function to train it. A zero-shot ablation study on never-before-seen textual worlds shows that our methodology significantly outperforms existing textual world modeling techniques as well as the importance of each of our contributions.\n",
      "Time series is a special type of sequence data, a set of observations collected at even intervals of time and ordered chronologically. Existing deep learning techniques use generic sequence models (e.g., recurrent neural network, Transformer model, or temporal convolutional network) for time series analysis, which ignore some of its unique properties. For example, the downsampling of time series data often preserves most of the information in the data, while this is not true for general sequence data such as text sequence and DNA sequence. Motivated by the above, in this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture and apply it for the time series forecasting problem, wherein we conduct sample convolution and interaction at multiple resolutions for temporal modeling. The proposed architecture, namelySCINet, facilitates extracting features with enhanced predictability. Experimental results show that SCINet achieves significant prediction accuracy improvement over existing solutions across various real-world time series forecasting datasets. In particular, it can achieve high fore-casting accuracy for those temporal-spatial datasets without using sophisticated spatial modeling techniques. Our codes and data are presented in the supplemental material.\n",
      "In many real-world imitation learning tasks, the demonstrator and the learner have to act in different but full observation spaces. This situation generates significant obstacles for existing imitation learning approaches to work, even when they are combined with traditional space adaptation techniques. The main challenge lies in bridging expert's occupancy measures to learner's dynamically changing occupancy measures under the different observation spaces. In this work, we model the above learning problem as Heterogeneous Observations Imitation Learning (HOIL). We propose the Importance Weighting with REjection (IWRE) algorithm based on the techniques of importance-weighting, learning with rejection, and active querying to solve the key challenge of occupancy measure matching. Experimental results show that IWRE can successfully solve HOIL tasks, including the challenging task of transforming the vision-based demonstrations to random access memory (RAM)-based policies under the Atari domain.\n",
      "Reducing computation cost, inference latency, and memory footprint of neural networks are frequently cited as research motivations for pruning and sparsity. However, operationalizing those benefits and understanding the end-to-end effect of algorithm design and regularization on the runtime execution is not often examined in depth.   Here we apply structured and unstructured pruning to attention weights of transformer blocks of the BERT language model, while also expanding block sparse representation (BSR) operations in the TVM compiler. Integration of BSR operations enables the TVM runtime execution to leverage structured pattern sparsity induced by model regularization.   This integrated view of pruning algorithms enables us to study relationships between modeling decisions and their direct impact on sparsity-enhanced execution. Our main findings are: 1) we validate that performance benefits of structured sparsity block regularization must be enabled by the BSR augmentations to TVM, with 4x speedup relative to vanilla PyTorch and 2.2x speedup relative to standard TVM compilation (without expanded BSR support). 2) for BERT attention weights, the end-to-end optimal block sparsity shape in this CPU inference context is not a square block (as in \\cite{gray2017gpu}) but rather a linear 32x1 block 3) the relationship between performance and block size / shape is is suggestive of how model regularization parameters interact with task scheduler optimizations resulting in the observed end-to-end performance.\n",
      "We approach self-supervised learning of image representations from a statistical dependence perspective, proposing Self-Supervised Learning with the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (SSL-HSIC). SSL-HSIC maximizes dependence between representations of transformed versions of an image and the image identity, while minimizing the kernelized variance of those features. This self-supervised learning framework yields a new understanding of InfoNCE, a variational lower bound on the mutual information (MI) between different transformations. While the MI itself is known to have pathologies which can result in meaningless representations being learned, its bound is much better behaved: we show that it implicitly approximates SSL-HSIC (with a slightly different regularizer). Our approach also gives us insight into BYOL, since SSL-HSIC similarly learns local neighborhoods of samples. SSL-HSIC allows us to directly optimize statistical dependence in time linear in the batch size, without restrictive data assumptions or indirect mutual information estimators. Trained with or without a target network, SSL-HSIC matches the current state-of-the-art for standard linear evaluation on ImageNet, semi-supervised learning and transfer to other classification and vision tasks such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation and object recognition.\n",
      "Transformers have achieved great success in many artificial intelligence fields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. Therefore, it is natural to attract lots of interest from academic and industry researchers. Up to the present, a great variety of Transformer variants (a.k.a. X-formers) have been proposed, however, a systematic and comprehensive literature review on these Transformer variants is still missing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various X-formers. We first briefly introduce the vanilla Transformer and then propose a new taxonomy of X-formers. Next, we introduce the various X-formers from three perspectives: architectural modification, pre-training, and applications. Finally, we outline some potential directions for future research.\n",
      "Though significant progress has been made in artistic style transfer, semantic information is usually difficult to be preserved in a fine-grained locally consistent manner by most existing methods, especially when multiple artists styles are required to transfer within one single model. To circumvent this issue, we propose a Stroke Control Multi-Artist Style Transfer framework. On the one hand, we develop a multi-condition single-generator structure which first performs multi-artist style transfer. On the one hand, we design an Anisotropic Stroke Module (ASM) which realizes the dynamic adjustment of style-stroke between the non-trivial and the trivial regions. ASM endows the network with the ability of adaptive semantic-consistency among various styles. On the other hand, we present an novel Multi-Scale Projection Discriminator} to realize the texture-level conditional generation. In contrast to the single-scale conditional discriminator, our discriminator is able to capture multi-scale texture clue to effectively distinguish a wide range of artistic styles. Extensive experimental results well demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Our framework can transform a photograph into different artistic style oil painting via only ONE single model. Furthermore, the results are with distinctive artistic style and retain the anisotropic semantic information. The code is already available on github: https://github.com/neuralchen/ASMAGAN.\n",
      "A few years ago, the first CNN surpassed human performance on ImageNet. However, it soon became clear that machines lack robustness on more challenging test cases, a major obstacle towards deploying machines \"in the wild\" and towards obtaining better computational models of human visual perception. Here we ask: Are we making progress in closing the gap between human and machine vision? To answer this question, we tested human observers on a broad range of out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, adding the \"missing human baseline\" by recording 85,120 psychophysical trials across 90 participants. We then investigated a range of promising machine learning developments that crucially deviate from standard supervised CNNs along three axes: objective function (self-supervised, adversarially trained, CLIP language-image training), architecture (e.g. vision transformers), and dataset size (ranging from 1M to 1B). Our findings are threefold. (1.) The longstanding robustness gap between humans and CNNs is closing, with the best models now matching or exceeding human performance on most OOD datasets. (2.) There is still a substantial image-level consistency gap, meaning that humans make different errors than models. In contrast, most models systematically agree in their categorisation errors, even substantially different ones like contrastive self-supervised vs. standard supervised models. (3.) In many cases, human-to-model consistency improves when training dataset size is increased by one to three orders of magnitude. Our results give reason for cautious optimism: While there is still much room for improvement, the behavioural difference between human and machine vision is narrowing. In order to measure future progress, 17 OOD datasets with image-level human behavioural data are provided as a benchmark here: https://github.com/bethgelab/model-vs-human/\n",
      "Attention mechanisms have shown promising results in sequence modeling tasks that require long-term memory. Recent work investigated mechanisms to reduce the computational cost of preserving and storing memories. However, not all content in the past is equally important to remember. We propose Expire-Span, a method that learns to retain the most important information and expire the irrelevant information. This forgetting of memories enables Transformers to scale to attend over tens of thousands of previous timesteps efficiently, as not all states from previous timesteps are preserved. We demonstrate that Expire-Span can help models identify and retain critical information and show it can achieve strong performance on reinforcement learning tasks specifically designed to challenge this functionality. Next, we show that Expire-Span can scale to memories that are tens of thousands in size, setting a new state of the art on incredibly long context tasks such as character-level language modeling and a frame-by-frame moving objects task. Finally, we analyze the efficiency of Expire-Span compared to existing approaches and demonstrate that it trains faster and uses less memory.\n",
      "The device used in this work detects the objects over the surface of the water using two thermal cameras which aid the users to detect and avoid the objects in scenarios where the human eyes cannot (night, fog, etc.). To avoid the obstacle collision autonomously, it is required to track the objects in real-time and assign a specific identity to each object to determine its dynamics (trajectory, velocity, etc.) for making estimated collision predictions. In the following work, a Machine Learning (ML) approach for Computer Vision (CV) called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used using TensorFlow as the high-level programming environment in Python. To validate the algorithm a test set was generated using an annotation tool that was created during the work for proper evaluation. Once validated, the algorithm was deployed on the platform and tested with the sequence generated by the test boat.\n",
      "Deep neural networks have been shown as a class of useful tools for addressing signal recognition issues in recent years, especially for identifying the nonlinear feature structures of signals. However, this power of most deep learning techniques heavily relies on an abundant amount of training data, so the performance of classic neural nets decreases sharply when the number of training data samples is small or unseen data are presented in the testing phase. This calls for an advanced strategy, i.e., model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), which is able to capture the invariant representation of the data samples or signals. In this paper, inspired by the special structure of the signal, i.e., real and imaginary parts consisted in practical time-series signals, we propose a Complex-valued Attentional MEta Learner (CAMEL) for the problem of few-shot signal recognition by leveraging attention and meta-learning in the complex domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first complex-valued MAML that can find the first-order stationary points of general nonconvex problems with theoretical convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments results showcase the superiority of the proposed CAMEL compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "This paper describes a machine learning (ML) framework for tropical cyclone intensity and track forecasting, combining multiple distinct ML techniques and utilizing diverse data sources. Our framework, which we refer to as Hurricast (HURR), is built upon the combination of distinct data processing techniques using gradient-boosted trees and novel encoder-decoder architectures, including CNN, GRU and Transformers components. We propose a deep-feature extractor methodology to mix spatial-temporal data with statistical data efficiently. Our multimodal framework unleashes the potential of making forecasts based on a wide range of data sources, including historical storm data, and visual data such as reanalysis atmospheric images. We evaluate our models with current operational forecasts in North Atlantic and Eastern Pacific basins on 2016-2019 for 24-hour lead time, and show our models consistently outperform statistical-dynamical models and compete with the best dynamical models, while computing forecasts in seconds. Furthermore, the inclusion of Hurricast into an operational forecast consensus model leads to a significant improvement of 5% - 15% over NHC's official forecast, thus highlighting the complementary properties with existing approaches. In summary, our work demonstrates that combining different data sources and distinct machine learning methodologies can lead to superior tropical cyclone forecasting. We hope that this work opens the door for further use of machine learning in meteorological forecasting.\n",
      "This paper is on video recognition using Transformers. Very recent attempts in this area have demonstrated promising results in terms of recognition accuracy, yet they have been also shown to induce, in many cases, significant computational overheads due to the additional modelling of the temporal information. In this work, we propose a Video Transformer model the complexity of which scales linearly with the number of frames in the video sequence and hence induces no overhead compared to an image-based Transformer model. To achieve this, our model makes two approximations to the full space-time attention used in Video Transformers: (a) It restricts time attention to a local temporal window and capitalizes on the Transformer's depth to obtain full temporal coverage of the video sequence. (b) It uses efficient space-time mixing to attend jointly spatial and temporal locations without inducing any additional cost on top of a spatial-only attention model. We also show how to integrate 2 very lightweight mechanisms for global temporal-only attention which provide additional accuracy improvements at minimal computational cost. We demonstrate that our model produces very high recognition accuracy on the most popular video recognition datasets while at the same time being significantly more efficient than other Video Transformer models. Code will be made available.\n",
      "Very recently, a variety of vision transformer architectures for dense prediction tasks have been proposed and they show that the design of spatial attention is critical to their success in these tasks. In this work, we revisit the design of the spatial attention and demonstrate that a carefully-devised yet simple spatial attention mechanism performs favourably against the state-of-the-art schemes. As a result, we propose two vision transformer architectures, namely, Twins-PCPVT and Twins-SVT. Our proposed architectures are highly-efficient and easy to implement, only involving matrix multiplications that are highly optimized in modern deep learning frameworks. More importantly, the proposed architectures achieve excellent performance on a wide range of visual tasks including imagelevel classification as well as dense detection and segmentation. The simplicity and strong performance suggest that our proposed architectures may serve as stronger backbones for many vision tasks. Our code will be released soon at https://github.com/Meituan-AutoML/Twins .\n",
      "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the go-to model for computer vision. Recently, attention-based networks, such as the Vision Transformer, have also become popular. In this paper we show that while convolutions and attention are both sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. We present MLP-Mixer, an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e. \"mixing\" the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e. \"mixing\" spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models. We hope that these results spark further research beyond the realms of well established CNNs and Transformers.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due to their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success of GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful connections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node representations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose enhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that improve scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are 230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph transformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the semantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show that GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art performance for node classification tasks.

      "The data distribution commonly evolves over time leading to problems such as concept drift that often decrease classifier performance. We seek to predict unseen data (and their labels) allowing us to tackle challenges due to a non-constant data distribution in a \\emph{proactive} manner rather than detecting and reacting to already existing changes that might already have led to errors. To this end, we learn a domain transformer in an unsupervised manner that allows generating data of unseen domains. Our approach first matches independently learned latent representations of two given domains obtained from an auto-encoder using a Cycle-GAN. In turn, a transformation of the original samples can be learned that can be applied iteratively to extrapolate to unseen domains. Our evaluation on CNNs on image data confirms the usefulness of the approach. It also achieves very good results on the well-known problem of unsupervised domain adaption, where labels but not samples have to be predicted.\n",
      "When in a new situation or geographical location, human drivers have an extraordinary ability to watch others and learn maneuvers that they themselves may have never performed. In contrast, existing techniques for learning to drive preclude such a possibility as they assume direct access to an instrumented ego-vehicle with fully known observations and expert driver actions. However, such measurements cannot be directly accessed for the non-ego vehicles when learning by watching others. Therefore, in an application where data is regarded as a highly valuable asset, current approaches completely discard the vast portion of the training data that can be potentially obtained through indirect observation of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by this key insight, we propose the Learning by Watching (LbW) framework which enables learning a driving policy without requiring full knowledge of neither the state nor expert actions. To increase its data, i.e., with new perspectives and maneuvers, LbW makes use of the demonstrations of other vehicles in a given scene by (1) transforming the ego-vehicle's observations to their points of view, and (2) inferring their expert actions. Our LbW agent learns more robust driving policies while enabling data-efficient learning, including quick adaptation of the policy to rare and novel scenarios. In particular, LbW drives robustly even with a fraction of available driving data required by existing methods, achieving an average success rate of 92% on the original CARLA benchmark with only 30 minutes of total driving data and 82% with only 10 minutes.\n",
      "Since Transformer has found widespread use in NLP, the potential of Transformer in CV has been realized and has inspired many new approaches. However, the computation required for replacing word tokens with image patches for Transformer after the tokenization of the image is vast(e.g., ViT), which bottlenecks model training and inference. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism in Transformer termed Cross Attention, which alternates attention inner the image patch instead of the whole image to capture local information and apply attention between image patches which are divided from single-channel feature maps capture global information. Both operations have less computation than standard self-attention in Transformer. By alternately applying attention inner patch and between patches, we implement cross attention to maintain the performance with lower computational cost and build a hierarchical network called Cross Attention Transformer(CAT) for other vision tasks. Our base model achieves state-of-the-arts on ImageNet-1K, and improves the performance of other methods on COCO and ADE20K, illustrating that our network has the potential to serve as general backbones.

      "A crucial requirement for reliable deployment of deep learning models for safety-critical applications is the ability to identify out-of-distribution (OOD) data points, samples which differ from the training data and on which a model might underperform. Previous work has attempted to tackle this problem using uncertainty estimation techniques. However, there is empirical evidence that a large family of these techniques do not detect OOD reliably in classification tasks.   This paper gives a theoretical explanation for said experimental findings and illustrates it on synthetic data. We prove that such techniques are not able to reliably identify OOD samples in a classification setting, since their level of confidence is generalized to unseen areas of the feature space. This result stems from the interplay between the representation of ReLU networks as piece-wise affine transformations, the saturating nature of activation functions like softmax, and the most widely-used uncertainty metrics.\n",
      "Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently received explosive popularity, but their enormous model sizes and training costs remain daunting. Conventional post-training pruning often incurs higher training budgets. In contrast, this paper aims to trim down both the training memory overhead and the inference complexity, without sacrificing the achievable accuracy. We launch and report the first-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration, on taking a unified approach of integrating sparsity in ViTs \"from end to end\". Specifically, instead of training full ViTs, we dynamically extract and train sparse subnetworks, while sticking to a fixed small parameter budget. Our approach jointly optimizes model parameters and explores connectivity throughout training, ending up with one sparse network as the final output. The approach is seamlessly extended from unstructured to structured sparsity, the latter by considering to guide the prune-and-grow of self-attention heads inside ViTs. For additional efficiency gains, we further co-explore data and architecture sparsity, by plugging in a novel learnable token selector to adaptively determine the currently most vital patches. Extensive results on ImageNet with diverse ViT backbones validate the effectiveness of our proposals which obtain significantly reduced computational cost and almost unimpaired generalization. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that the proposed sparse (co-)training can even improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it, making sparsity a tantalizing \"free lunch\". For example, our sparsified DeiT-Small at (5%, 50%) sparsity for (data, architecture), improves 0.28% top-1 accuracy, and meanwhile enjoys 49.32% FLOPs and 4.40% running time savings.

      "Distilling analytical models from data has the potential to advance our understanding and prediction of nonlinear dynamics. Although discovery of governing equations based on observed system states (e.g., trajectory time series) has revealed success in a wide range of nonlinear dynamics, uncovering the closed-form equations directly from raw videos still remains an open challenge. To this end, we introduce a novel end-to-end unsupervised deep learning framework to uncover the mathematical structure of equations that governs the dynamics of moving objects in videos. Such an architecture consists of (1) an encoder-decoder network that learns low-dimensional spatial/pixel coordinates of the moving object, (2) a learnable Spatial-Physical Transformation component that creates mapping between the extracted spatial/pixel coordinates and the latent physical states of dynamics, and (3) a numerical integrator-based sparse regression module that uncovers the parsimonious closed-form governing equations of learned physical states and, meanwhile, serves as a constraint to the autoencoder. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by uncovering the governing equations of a variety of nonlinear dynamical systems depicted by moving objects in videos. The resulting computational framework enables discovery of parsimonious interpretable model in a flexible and accessible sensing environment where only videos are available.\n",
      "The field of Deep Learning is rich with empirical evidence of human-like performance on a variety of prediction tasks. However, despite these successes, the recent Predicting Generalization in Deep Learning (PGDL) NeurIPS 2020 competition suggests that there is a need for more robust and efficient measures of network generalization. In this work, we propose a new framework for evaluating the generalization capabilities of trained networks. We use perturbation response (PR) curves that capture the accuracy change of a given network as a function of varying levels of training sample perturbation. From these PR curves, we derive novel statistics that capture generalization capability. Specifically, we introduce two new measures for accurately predicting generalization gaps: the Gi-score and Pal-score, that are inspired by the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio (measures of income inequality), that accurately predict generalization gaps. Using our framework applied to intra and inter class sample mixup, we attain better predictive scores than the current state-of-the-art measures on a majority of tasks in the PGDL competition. In addition, we show that our framework and the proposed statistics can be used to capture to what extent a trained network is invariant to a given parametric input transformation, such as rotation or translation. Therefore, these generalization gap prediction statistics also provide a useful means for selecting the optimal network architectures and hyperparameters that are invariant to a certain perturbation.\n",
      "Attention-based neural networks such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) have recently attained state-of-the-art results on many computer vision benchmarks. Scale is a primary ingredient in attaining excellent results, therefore, understanding a model's scaling properties is a key to designing future generations effectively. While the laws for scaling Transformer language models have been studied, it is unknown how Vision Transformers scale. To address this, we scale ViT models and data, both up and down, and characterize the relationships between error rate, data, and compute. Along the way, we refine the architecture and training of ViT, reducing memory consumption and increasing accuracy the resulting models. As a result, we successfully train a ViT model with two billion parameters, which attains a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet of 90.45% top-1 accuracy. The model also performs well on few-shot learning, for example, attaining 84.86% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 10 examples per class.\n",
      "Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across various machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head self-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image patches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such flexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can facilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain shifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We systematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments encompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing convolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following intriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe occlusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content. (b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local textures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to CNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate shape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system, previously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape representation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic segmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a single ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high accuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional and few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to flexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention mechanism.\n",
      "We present DistillFlow, a knowledge distillation approach to learning optical flow. DistillFlow trains multiple teacher models and a student model, where challenging transformations are applied to the input of the student model to generate hallucinated occlusions as well as less confident predictions. Then, a self-supervised learning framework is constructed: confident predictions from teacher models are served as annotations to guide the student model to learn optical flow for those less confident predictions. The self-supervised learning framework enables us to effectively learn optical flow from unlabeled data, not only for non-occluded pixels, but also for occluded pixels. DistillFlow achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised learning performance on both KITTI and Sintel datasets. Our self-supervised pre-trained model also provides an excellent initialization for supervised fine-tuning, suggesting an alternate training paradigm in contrast to current supervised learning methods that highly rely on pre-training on synthetic data. At the time of writing, our fine-tuned models ranked 1st among all monocular methods on the KITTI 2015 benchmark, and outperform all published methods on the Sintel Final benchmark. More importantly, we demonstrate the generalization capability of DistillFlow in three aspects: framework generalization, correspondence generalization and cross-dataset generalization.\n",
      "Vision transformers (ViTs) process input images as sequences of patches via self-attention; a radically different architecture than convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This makes it interesting to study the adversarial feature space of ViT models and their transferability. In particular, we observe that adversarial patterns found via conventional adversarial attacks show very low black-box transferability even for large ViT models. However, we show that this phenomenon is only due to the sub-optimal attack procedures that do not leverage the true representation potential of ViTs. A deep ViT is composed of multiple blocks, with a consistent architecture comprising of self-attention and feed-forward layers, where each block is capable of independently producing a class token. Formulating an attack using only the last class token (conventional approach) does not directly leverage the discriminative information stored in the earlier tokens, leading to poor adversarial transferability of ViTs. Using the compositional nature of ViT models, we enhance the transferability of existing attacks by introducing two novel strategies specific to the architecture of ViT models. (i) Self-Ensemble: We propose a method to find multiple discriminative pathways by dissecting a single ViT model into an ensemble of networks. This allows explicitly utilizing class-specific information at each ViT block. (ii) Token Refinement: We then propose to refine the tokens to further enhance the discriminative capacity at each block of ViT. Our token refinement systematically combines the class tokens with structural information preserved within the patch tokens. An adversarial attack, when applied to such refined tokens within the ensemble of classifiers found in a single vision transformer, has significantly higher transferability.\n",
      "This paper underlines a subtle property of batch-normalization (BN): Successive batch normalizations with random linear transformations make hidden representations increasingly orthogonal across layers of a deep neural network. We establish a non-asymptotic characterization of the interplay between depth, width, and the orthogonality of deep representations. More precisely, under a mild assumption, we prove that the deviation of the representations from orthogonality rapidly decays with depth up to a term inversely proportional to the network width. This result has two main implications: 1) Theoretically, as the depth grows, the distribution of the representation -- after the linear layers -- contracts to a Wasserstein-2 ball around an isotropic Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, the radius of this Wasserstein ball shrinks with the width of the network. 2) In practice, the orthogonality of the representations directly influences the performance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). When representations are initially aligned, we observe SGD wastes many iterations to orthogonalize representations before the classification. Nevertheless, we experimentally show that starting optimization from orthogonal representations is sufficient to accelerate SGD, with no need for BN.\n",
      "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) raises keen attention to identifying sparse trainable subnetworks, or winning tickets, of training, which can be trained in isolation to achieve similar or even better performance compared to the full models. Despite many efforts being made, the most effective method to identify such winning tickets is still Iterative Magnitude-based Pruning (IMP), which is computationally expensive and has to be run thoroughly for every different network. A natural question that comes in is: can we \"transform\" the winning ticket found in one network to another with a different architecture, yielding a winning ticket for the latter at the beginning, without re-doing the expensive IMP? Answering this question is not only practically relevant for efficient \"once-for-all\" winning ticket finding, but also theoretically appealing for uncovering inherently scalable sparse patterns in networks. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and propose a variety of strategies to tweak the winning tickets found from different networks of the same model family (e.g., ResNets). Based on these results, we articulate the Elastic Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (E-LTH): by mindfully replicating (or dropping) and re-ordering layers for one network, its corresponding winning ticket could be stretched (or squeezed) into a subnetwork for another deeper (or shallower) network from the same family, whose performance is nearly the same competitive as the latter's winning ticket directly found by IMP. We have also thoroughly compared E-LTH with pruning-at-initialization and dynamic sparse training methods, and discuss the generalizability of E-LTH to different model families, layer types, or across datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/ElasticLTH.\n",
      "Pool-based sampling in active learning (AL) represents a key framework for an-notating informative data when dealing with deep learning models. In this paper, we present a novel pipeline for pool-based Active Learning. Unlike most previous works, our method exploits accessible unlabelled examples during training to estimate their co-relation with the labelled examples. Another contribution of this paper is to adapt Visual Transformer as a sampler in the AL pipeline. Visual Transformer models non-local visual concept dependency between labelled and unlabelled examples, which is crucial to identifying the influencing unlabelled examples. Also, compared to existing methods where the learner and the sampler are trained in a multi-stage manner, we propose to train them in a task-aware jointly manner which enables transforming the latent space into two separate tasks: one that classifies the labelled examples; the other that distinguishes the labelling direction. We evaluated our work on four different challenging benchmarks of classification and detection tasks viz. CIFAR10, CIFAR100,FashionMNIST, RaFD, and Pascal VOC 2007. Our extensive empirical and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the existing methods.

      "In certain situations, Neural Networks (NN) are trained upon data that obey underlying physical symmetries. However, it is not guaranteed that NNs will obey the underlying symmetry unless embedded in the network structure. In this work, we explore a special kind of symmetry where functions are invariant with respect to involutory linear/affine transformations up to parity $p=\\pm 1$. We develop mathematical theorems and propose NN architectures that ensure invariance and universal approximation properties. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed models outperform baseline networks while respecting the imposed symmetry. An adaption of our technique to convolutional NN classification tasks for datasets with inherent horizontal/vertical reflection symmetry has also been proposed.\n",
      "Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and Transformer have achieved remarkable successes in image recognition. However, their performance in fine-grained image recognition is still difficult to meet the requirements of actual needs. This paper proposes a Sequence Random Network (SRN) to enhance the performance of DCNN. The output of DCNN is one-dimensional features. This one-dimensional feature abstractly represents image information, but it does not express well the detailed information of image. To address this issue, we use the proposed SRN which composed of BiLSTM and several Tanh-Dropout blocks (called BiLSTM-TDN), to further process DCNN one-dimensional features for highlighting the detail information of image. After the feature transform by BiLSTM-TDN, the recognition performance has been greatly improved. We conducted the experiments on six fine-grained image datasets. Except for FGVC-Aircraft, the accuracies of the proposed methods on the other datasets exceeded 99%. Experimental results show that BiLSTM-TDN is far superior to the existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition to DCNN, BiLSTM-TDN can also be extended to other models, such as Transformer.\n",
      "Transformer-based deep learning models have increasingly demonstrated high accuracy on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we propose a compression-compilation co-design framework that can guarantee the identified model to meet both resource and real-time specifications of mobile devices. Our framework applies a compiler-aware neural architecture optimization method (CANAO), which can generate the optimal compressed model that balances both accuracy and latency. We are able to achieve up to 7.8x speedup compared with TensorFlow-Lite with only minor accuracy loss. We present two types of BERT applications on mobile devices: Question Answering (QA) and Text Generation. Both can be executed in real-time with latency as low as 45ms. Videos for demonstrating the framework can be found on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WIRvK_2PZI\n",
      "Current federated learning algorithms take tens of communication rounds transmitting unwieldy model weights under ideal circumstances and hundreds when data is poorly distributed. Inspired by recent work on dataset distillation and distributed one-shot learning, we propose Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning (DOSFL) to significantly reduce the communication cost while achieving comparable performance. In just one round, each client distills their private dataset, sends the synthetic data (e.g. images or sentences) to the server, and collectively trains a global model. The distilled data look like noise and are only useful to the specific model weights, i.e., become useless after the model updates. With this weight-less and gradient-less design, the total communication cost of DOSFL is up to three orders of magnitude less than FedAvg while preserving between 93% to 99% performance of a centralized counterpart. Afterwards, clients could switch to traditional methods such as FedAvg to finetune the last few percent to fit personalized local models with local datasets. Through comprehensive experiments, we show the accuracy and communication performance of DOSFL on both vision and language tasks with different models including CNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc. We demonstrate that an eavesdropping attacker cannot properly train a good model using the leaked distilled data, without knowing the initial model weights. DOSFL serves as an inexpensive method to quickly converge on a performant pre-trained model with less than 0.1% communication cost of traditional methods.\n",
      "An effective understanding of the contextual environment and accurate motion forecasting of surrounding agents is crucial for the development of autonomous vehicles and social mobile robots. This task is challenging since the behavior of an autonomous agent is not only affected by its own intention, but also by the static environment and surrounding dynamically interacting agents. Previous works focused on utilizing the spatial and temporal information in time domain while not sufficiently taking advantage of the cues in frequency domain. To this end, we propose a Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (SpecTGNN), which can capture inter-agent correlations and temporal dependency simultaneously in frequency domain in addition to time domain. SpecTGNN operates on both an agent graph with dynamic state information and an environment graph with the features extracted from context images in two streams. The model integrates graph Fourier transform, spectral graph convolution and temporal gated convolution to encode history information and forecast future trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a multi-head spatio-temporal attention mechanism to mitigate the effect of error propagation in a long time horizon. We demonstrate the performance of SpecTGNN on two public trajectory prediction benchmark datasets, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction accuracy.\n",
      "Computer-aided design (CAD) is the most widely used modeling approach for technical design. The typical starting point in these designs is 2D sketches which can later be extruded and combined to obtain complex three-dimensional assemblies. Such sketches are typically composed of parametric primitives, such as points, lines, and circular arcs, augmented with geometric constraints linking the primitives, such as coincidence, parallelism, or orthogonality. Sketches can be represented as graphs, with the primitives as nodes and the constraints as edges. Training a model to automatically generate CAD sketches can enable several novel workflows, but is challenging due to the complexity of the graphs and the heterogeneity of the primitives and constraints. In particular, each type of primitive and constraint may require a record of different size and parameter types. We propose SketchGen as a generative model based on a transformer architecture to address the heterogeneity problem by carefully designing a sequential language for the primitives and constraints that allows distinguishing between different primitive or constraint types and their parameters, while encouraging our model to re-use information across related parameters, encoding shared structure. A particular highlight of our work is the ability to produce primitives linked via constraints that enables the final output to be further regularized via a constraint solver. We evaluate our model by demonstrating constraint prediction for given sets of primitives and full sketch generation from scratch, showing that our approach significantly out performs the state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation.\n",
      "The advent of the transformer has sparked a quick growth in the size of language models, far outpacing hardware improvements. (Dense) transformers are expected to reach the trillion-parameter scale in the near future, for which training requires thousands or even tens of thousands of GPUs. We investigate the challenges of training at this scale and beyond on commercially available hardware. In particular, we analyse the shortest possible training time for different configurations of distributed training, leveraging empirical scaling laws for language models to estimate the optimal (critical) batch size. Contrary to popular belief, we find no evidence for a memory wall, and instead argue that the real limitation -- other than the cost -- lies in the training duration.   In addition to this analysis, we introduce two new methods, \\textit{layered gradient accumulation} and \\textit{modular pipeline parallelism}, which together cut the shortest training time by half. The methods also reduce data movement, lowering the network requirement to a point where a fast InfiniBand connection is not necessary. This increased network efficiency also improve on the methods introduced with the ZeRO optimizer, reducing the memory usage to a tiny fraction of the available GPU memory.\n",
      "In real-world systems, models are frequently updated as more data becomes available, and in addition to achieving high accuracy, the goal is to also maintain a low difference in predictions compared to the base model (i.e. predictive ``churn''). If model retraining results in vastly different behavior, then it could cause negative effects in downstream systems, especially if this churn can be avoided with limited impact on model accuracy. In this paper, we show an equivalence between training with distillation using the base model as the teacher and training with an explicit constraint on the predictive churn. We then show that distillation performs strongly for low churn training against a number of recent baselines on a wide range of datasets and model architectures, including fully-connected networks, convolutional networks, and transformers.\n",
      "We introduce CAFLOW, a new diverse image-to-image translation model that simultaneously leverages the power of auto-regressive modeling and the modeling efficiency of conditional normalizing flows. We transform the conditioning image into a sequence of latent encodings using a multi-scale normalizing flow and repeat the process for the conditioned image. We model the conditional distribution of the latent encodings by modeling the auto-regressive distributions with an efficient multi-scale normalizing flow, where each conditioning factor affects image synthesis at its respective resolution scale. Our proposed framework performs well on a range of image-to-image translation tasks. It outperforms former designs of conditional flows because of its expressive auto-regressive structure.\n",
      "When a human asks questions online, or when a conversational virtual agent asks human questions, questions triggering emotions or with details might more likely to get responses or answers. we explore how to automatically rewrite natural language questions to improve the response rate from people. In particular, a new task of Visual Question Rewriting(VQR) task is introduced to explore how visual information can be used to improve the new questions. A data set containing around 4K bland questions, attractive questions and images triples is collected. We developed some baseline sequence to sequence models and more advanced transformer based models, which take a bland question and a related image as input and output a rewritten question that is expected to be more attractive. Offline experiments and mechanical Turk based evaluations show that it is possible to rewrite bland questions in a more detailed and attractive way to increase the response rate, and images can be helpful.\n",
      "Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet. Code is available at https://github.com/raoyongming/DynamicViT\n",
      "While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.\n",
      "With the advent of state of the art nature-inspired pure attention based models i.e. transformers, and their success in natural language processing (NLP), their extension to machine vision (MV) tasks was inevitable and much felt. Subsequently, vision transformers (ViTs) were introduced which are giving quite a challenge to the established deep learning based machine vision techniques. However, pure attention based models/architectures like transformers require huge data, large training times and large computational resources. Some recent works suggest that combinations of these two varied fields can prove to build systems which have the advantages of both these fields. Accordingly, this state of the art survey paper is introduced which hopefully will help readers get useful information about this interesting and potential research area. A gentle introduction to attention mechanisms is given, followed by a discussion of the popular attention based deep architectures. Subsequently, the major categories of the intersection of attention mechanisms and deep learning for machine vision (MV) based are discussed. Afterwards, the major algorithms, issues and trends within the scope of the paper are discussed.\n",
      "Imagine trying to track one particular fruitfly in a swarm of hundreds. Higher biological visual systems have evolved to track moving objects by relying on both appearance and motion features. We investigate if state-of-the-art deep neural networks for visual tracking are capable of the same. For this, we introduce PathTracker, a synthetic visual challenge that asks human observers and machines to track a target object in the midst of identical-looking \"distractor\" objects. While humans effortlessly learn PathTracker and generalize to systematic variations in task design, state-of-the-art deep networks struggle. To address this limitation, we identify and model circuit mechanisms in biological brains that are implicated in tracking objects based on motion cues. When instantiated as a recurrent network, our circuit model learns to solve PathTracker with a robust visual strategy that rivals human performance and explains a significant proportion of their decision-making on the challenge. We also show that the success of this circuit model extends to object tracking in natural videos. Adding it to a transformer-based architecture for object tracking builds tolerance to visual nuisances that affect object appearance, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale TrackingNet object tracking challenge. Our work highlights the importance of building artificial vision models that can help us better understand human vision and improve computer vision.\n",
      "We propose a novel scene flow estimation approach to capture and infer 3D motions from point clouds. Estimating 3D motions for point clouds is challenging, since a point cloud is unordered and its density is significantly non-uniform. Such unstructured data poses difficulties in matching corresponding points between point clouds, leading to inaccurate flow estimation. We propose a novel architecture named Sparse Convolution-Transformer Network (SCTN) that equips the sparse convolution with the transformer. Specifically, by leveraging the sparse convolution, SCTN transfers irregular point cloud into locally consistent flow features for estimating continuous and consistent motions within an object/local object part. We further propose to explicitly learn point relations using a point transformer module, different from exiting methods. We show that the learned relation-based contextual information is rich and helpful for matching corresponding points, benefiting scene flow estimation. In addition, a novel loss function is proposed to adaptively encourage flow consistency according to feature similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves a new state of the art in scene flow estimation. Our approach achieves an error of 0.038 and 0.037 (EPE3D) on FlyingThings3D and KITTI Scene Flow respectively, which significantly outperforms previous methods by large margins.\n",
      "We consider the problem of molecular graph generation using deep models. While graphs are discrete, most existing methods use continuous latent variables, resulting in inaccurate modeling of discrete graph structures. In this work, we propose GraphDF, a novel discrete latent variable model for molecular graph generation based on normalizing flow methods. GraphDF uses invertible modulo shift transforms to map discrete latent variables to graph nodes and edges. We show that the use of discrete latent variables reduces computational costs and eliminates the negative effect of dequantization. Comprehensive experimental results show that GraphDF outperforms prior methods on random generation, property optimization, and constrained optimization tasks.\n",
      "In this work, we introduce a novel task - Humancentric Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (HC-STVG). Unlike the existing referring expression tasks in images or videos, by focusing on humans, HC-STVG aims to localize a spatiotemporal tube of the target person from an untrimmed video based on a given textural description. This task is useful, especially for healthcare and security-related applications, where the surveillance videos can be extremely long but only a specific person during a specific period of time is concerned. HC-STVG is a video grounding task that requires both spatial (where) and temporal (when) localization. Unfortunately, the existing grounding methods cannot handle this task well. We tackle this task by proposing an effective baseline method named Spatio-Temporal Grounding with Visual Transformers (STGVT), which utilizes Visual Transformers to extract cross-modal representations for video-sentence matching and temporal localization. To facilitate this task, we also contribute an HC-STVG dataset consisting of 5,660 video-sentence pairs on complex multi-person scenes. Specifically, each video lasts for 20 seconds, pairing with a natural query sentence with an average of 17.25 words. Extensive experiments are conducted on this dataset, demonstrating the newly-proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods.\n",
      "In this paper, we introduce a unique variant of the denoising Auto-Encoder and combine it with the perceptual loss to classify images in an unsupervised manner. The proposed method, called Pseudo Labelling, consists of first applying a randomly sampled set of data augmentation transformations to each training image. As a result, each initial image can be considered as a pseudo-label to its corresponding augmented ones. Then, an Auto-Encoder is used to learn the mapping between each set of the augmented images and its corresponding pseudo-label. Furthermore, the perceptual loss is employed to take into consideration the existing dependencies between the pixels in the same neighbourhood of an image. This combination encourages the encoder to output richer encodings that are highly informative of the input's class. Consequently, the Auto-Encoder's performance on unsupervised image classification is improved in terms of stability, accuracy and consistency across all tested datasets. Previous state-of-the-art accuracy on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets is improved by 0.3\\%, 3.11\\% and 9.21\\% respectively.\n",
      "Vision Transformers (ViT) have achieved remarkable success in large-scale image recognition. They split every 2D image into a fixed number of patches, each of which is treated as a token. Generally, representing an image with more tokens would lead to higher prediction accuracy, while it also results in drastically increased computational cost. To achieve a decent trade-off between accuracy and speed, the number of tokens is empirically set to 16x16. In this paper, we argue that every image has its own characteristics, and ideally the token number should be conditioned on each individual input. In fact, we have observed that there exist a considerable number of \"easy\" images which can be accurately predicted with a mere number of 4x4 tokens, while only a small fraction of \"hard\" ones need a finer representation. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a Dynamic Transformer to automatically configure a proper number of tokens for each input image. This is achieved by cascading multiple Transformers with increasing numbers of tokens, which are sequentially activated in an adaptive fashion at test time, i.e., the inference is terminated once a sufficiently confident prediction is produced. We further design efficient feature reuse and relationship reuse mechanisms across different components of the Dynamic Transformer to reduce redundant computations. Extensive empirical results on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the competitive baselines in terms of both theoretical computational efficiency and practical inference speed.\n",
      "In this paper, we study the task of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), where the source data are not available during target adaptation. Previous works on SFDA mainly focus on aligning the cross-domain distributions. However, they ignore the generalization ability of the pretrained source model, which largely influences the initial target outputs that are vital to the target adaptation stage. To address this, we make the interesting observation that the model accuracy is highly correlated with whether or not attention is focused on the objects in an image. To this end, we propose a generic and effective framework based on Transformer, named TransDA, for learning a generalized model for SFDA. Specifically, we apply the Transformer as the attention module and inject it into a convolutional network. By doing so, the model is encouraged to turn attention towards the object regions, which can effectively improve the model's generalization ability on the target domains. Moreover, a novel self-supervised knowledge distillation approach is proposed to adapt the Transformer with target pseudo-labels, thus further encouraging the network to focus on the object regions. Experiments on three domain adaptation tasks, including closed-set, partial-set, and open-set adaption, demonstrate that TransDA can greatly improve the adaptation accuracy and produce state-of-the-art results. The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/ygjwd12345/TransDA.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Transformer Memory (HTM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HTM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HTM can therefore \"mentally time-travel\" -- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HTM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HTM can extrapolate to task sequences an order of magnitude longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HTM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n",
      "The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is the wide-network limit of a kernel defined using neural networks at initialization, whose embedding is the gradient of the output of the network with respect to its parameters. We study the \"after kernel\", which is defined using the same embedding, except after training, for neural networks with standard architectures, on binary classification problems extracted from MNIST and CIFAR-10, trained using SGD in a standard way. For some dataset-architecture pairs, after a few epochs of neural network training, a hard-margin SVM using the network's after kernel is much more accurate than when the network's initial kernel is used. For networks with an architecture similar to VGG, the after kernel is more \"global\", in the sense that it is less invariant to transformations of input images that disrupt the global structure of the image while leaving the local statistics largely intact. For fully connected networks, the after kernel is less global in this sense. The after kernel tends to be more invariant to small shifts, rotations and zooms; data augmentation does not improve these invariances. The (finite approximation to the) conjugate kernel, obtained using the last layer of hidden nodes, sometimes, but not always, provides a good approximation to the NTK and the after kernel.\n",
      "Many recent invertible neural architectures are based on coupling block designs where variables are divided in two subsets which serve as inputs of an easily invertible (usually affine) triangular transformation. While such a transformation is invertible, its Jacobian is very sparse and thus may lack expressiveness. This work presents a simple remedy by noting that subdivision and (affine) coupling can be repeated recursively within the resulting subsets, leading to an efficiently invertible block with dense, triangular Jacobian. By formulating our recursive coupling scheme via a hierarchical architecture, HINT allows sampling from a joint distribution p(y,x) and the corresponding posterior p(x|y) using a single invertible network. We evaluate our method on some standard data sets and benchmark its full power for density estimation and Bayesian inference on a novel data set of 2D shapes in Fourier parameterization, which enables consistent visualization of samples for different dimensionalities.\n",
      "Channel pruning and tensor decomposition have received extensive attention in convolutional neural network compression. However, these two techniques are traditionally deployed in an isolated manner, leading to significant accuracy drop when pursuing high compression rates. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Compression (CC) scheme, which joints channel pruning and tensor decomposition to compress CNN models by simultaneously learning the model sparsity and low-rankness. Specifically, we first investigate the compression sensitivity of each layer in the network, and then propose a Global Compression Rate Optimization that transforms the decision problem of compression rate into an optimization problem. After that, we propose multi-step heuristic compression to remove redundant compression units step-by-step, which fully considers the effect of the remaining compression space (i.e., unremoved compression units). Our method demonstrates superior performance gains over previous ones on various datasets and backbone architectures. For example, we achieve 52.9% FLOPs reduction by removing 48.4% parameters on ResNet-50 with only a Top-1 accuracy drop of 0.56% on ImageNet 2012.\n",
      "The learning rate (LR) schedule is one of the most important hyper-parameters needing careful tuning in training DNNs. However, it is also one of the least automated parts of machine learning systems and usually costs significant manual effort and computing. Though there are pre-defined LR schedules and optimizers with adaptive LR, they introduce new hyperparameters that need to be tuned separately for different tasks/datasets. In this paper, we consider the question: Can we automatically tune the LR over the course of training without human involvement? We propose an efficient method, AutoLRS, which automatically optimizes the LR for each training stage by modeling training dynamics. AutoLRS aims to find an LR applied to every $\\tau$ steps that minimizes the resulted validation loss. We solve this black-box optimization on the fly by Bayesian optimization (BO). However, collecting training instances for BO requires a system to evaluate each LR queried by BO's acquisition function for $\\tau$ steps, which is prohibitively expensive in practice. Instead, we apply each candidate LR for only $\\tau'\\ll\\tau$ steps and train an exponential model to predict the validation loss after $\\tau$ steps. This mutual-training process between BO and the loss-prediction model allows us to limit the training steps invested in the BO search. We demonstrate the advantages and the generality of AutoLRS through extensive experiments of training DNNs for tasks from diverse domains using different optimizers. The LR schedules auto-generated by AutoLRS lead to a speedup of $1.22\\times$, $1.43\\times$, and $1.5\\times$ when training ResNet-50, Transformer, and BERT, respectively, compared to the LR schedules in their original papers, and an average speedup of $1.31\\times$ over state-of-the-art heavily-tuned LR schedules.\n",
      "Many efforts have been devoted to designing sampling, mining, and weighting strategies in high-level deep metric learning (DML) loss objectives. However, little attention has been paid to low-level but essential data transformation. In this paper, we develop a novel mechanism, the independent domain embedding augmentation learning ({IDEAL}) method. It can simultaneously learn multiple independent embedding spaces for multiple domains generated by predefined data transformations. Our IDEAL is orthogonal to existing DML techniques and can be seamlessly combined with prior DML approaches for enhanced performance. Empirical results on visual retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. For example, the IDEAL improves the performance of MS loss by a large margin, 84.5\\% $\\rightarrow$ 87.1\\% on Cars-196, and 65.8\\% $\\rightarrow$ 69.5\\% on CUB-200 at Recall$@1$. Our IDEAL with MS loss also achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on three image retrieval benchmarks, \\ie, \\emph{Cars-196}, \\emph{CUB-200}, and \\emph{SOP}. It outperforms the most recent DML approaches, such as Circle loss and XBM, significantly. The source code and pre-trained models of our method will be available at\\emph{\\url{https://github.com/emdata-ailab/IDEAL}}.\n",
      "Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the style characteristics of one image onto another image while retaining its content. Existing approaches commonly leverage various normalization techniques, although these face limitations in adequately transferring diverse textures to different spatial locations. Self-Attention-based approaches have tackled this issue with partial success but suffer from unwanted artifacts. Motivated by these observations, this paper aims to combine the best of both worlds: self-attention and normalization. That yields a new plug-and-play module that we name Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization (SAFIN). SAFIN is essentially a spatially adaptive normalization module whose parameters are inferred through attention on the content and style image. We demonstrate that plugging SAFIN into the base network of another state-of-the-art method results in enhanced stylization. We also develop a novel base network composed of Wavelet Transform for multi-scale style transfer, which when combined with SAFIN, produces visually appealing results with lesser unwanted textures.\n",
      "In 2019, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Health Outcomes Challenge seeking solutions to predict risk in value-based care for incorporation into CMS Innovation Center payment and service delivery models. Recently, modern language models have played key roles in a number of health related tasks. This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of these models to patient readmission prediction. To facilitate this, we create a dataset of 1.2 million medical history samples derived from the Limited Dataset (LDS) issued by CMS. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive modeling solution centered on a deep learning framework for this data. To demonstrate the framework, we train an attention-based Transformer to learn Medicare semantics in support of performing downstream prediction tasks thereby achieving 0.91 AUC and 0.91 recall on readmission classification. We also introduce a novel data pre-processing pipeline and discuss pertinent deployment considerations surrounding model explainability and bias.\n",
      "Deep neural networks are found to be prone to adversarial examples which could deliberately fool the model to make mistakes. Recently, a few of works expand this task from 2D image to 3D point cloud by using global point cloud optimization. However, the perturbations of global point are not effective for misleading the victim model. First, not all points are important in optimization toward misleading. Abundant points account considerable distortion budget but contribute trivially to attack. Second, the multi-label optimization is suboptimal for adversarial attack, since it consumes extra energy in finding multi-label victim model collapse and causes instance transformation to be dissimilar to any particular instance. Third, the independent adversarial and perceptibility losses, caring misclassification and dissimilarity separately, treat the updating of each point equally without a focus. Therefore, once perceptibility loss approaches its budget threshold, all points would be stock in the surface of hypersphere and attack would be locked in local optimality. Therefore, we propose a local aggressive adversarial attacks (L3A) to solve above issues. Technically, we select a bunch of salient points, the high-score subset of point cloud according to gradient, to perturb. Then a flow of aggressive optimization strategies are developed to reinforce the unperceptive generation of adversarial examples toward misleading victim models. Extensive experiments on PointNet, PointNet++ and DGCNN demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method against existing adversarial attack methods.\n",
      "Understanding pedestrian crossing behavior is an essential goal in intelligent vehicle development, leading to an improvement in their security and traffic flow. In this paper, we developed a method called IntFormer. It is based on transformer architecture and a novel convolutional video classification model called RubiksNet. Following the evaluation procedure in a recent benchmark, we show that our model reaches state-of-the-art results with good performance ($\\approx 40$ seq. per second) and size ($8\\times $smaller than the best performing model), making it suitable for real-time usage. We also explore each of the input features, finding that ego-vehicle speed is the most important variable, possibly due to the similarity in crossing cases in PIE dataset.\n",
      "We present a framework to generate synthetic historical documents with precise ground truth using nothing more than a collection of unlabeled historical images. Obtaining large labeled datasets is often the limiting factor to effectively use supervised deep learning methods for Document Image Analysis (DIA). Prior approaches towards synthetic data generation either require expertise or result in poor accuracy in the synthetic documents. To achieve high precision transformations without requiring expertise, we tackle the problem in two steps. First, we create template documents with user-specified content and structure. Second, we transfer the style of a collection of unlabeled historical images to these template documents while preserving their text and layout. We evaluate the use of our synthetic historical documents in a pre-training setting and find that we outperform the baselines (randomly initialized and pre-trained). Additionally, with visual examples, we demonstrate a high-quality synthesis that makes it possible to generate large labeled historical document datasets with precise ground truth.\n",
      "Age progression and regression aim to synthesize photorealistic appearance of a given face image with aging and rejuvenation effects, respectively. Existing generative adversarial networks (GANs) based methods suffer from the following three major issues: 1) unstable training introducing strong ghost artifacts in the generated faces, 2) unpaired training leading to unexpected changes in facial attributes such as genders and races, and 3) non-bijective age mappings increasing the uncertainty in the face transformation. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed AgeFlow, to integrate the advantages of both flow-based models and GANs. The proposed AgeFlow contains three parts: an encoder that maps a given face to a latent space through an invertible neural network, a novel invertible conditional translation module (ICTM) that translates the source latent vector to target one, and a decoder that reconstructs the generated face from the target latent vector using the same encoder network; all parts are invertible achieving bijective age mappings. The novelties of ICTM are two-fold. First, we propose an attribute-aware knowledge distillation to learn the manipulation direction of age progression while keeping other unrelated attributes unchanged, alleviating unexpected changes in facial attributes. Second, we propose to use GANs in the latent space to ensure the learned latent vector indistinguishable from the real ones, which is much easier than traditional use of GANs in the image domain. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over existing GANs-based methods on two benchmarked datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/AgeFlow.\n",
      "Table Structure Recognition is an essential part of end-to-end tabular data extraction in document images. The recent success of deep learning model architectures in computer vision remains to be non-reflective in table structure recognition, largely because extensive datasets for this domain are still unavailable while labeling new data is expensive and time-consuming. Traditionally, in computer vision, these challenges are addressed by standard augmentation techniques that are based on image transformations like color jittering and random cropping. As demonstrated by our experiments, these techniques are not effective for the task of table structure recognition. In this paper, we propose TabAug, a re-imagined Data Augmentation technique that produces structural changes in table images through replication and deletion of rows and columns. It also consists of a data-driven probabilistic model that allows control over the augmentation process. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we perform experimentation on ICDAR 2013 dataset where our approach shows consistent improvements in all aspects of the evaluation metrics, with cell-level correct detections improving from 92.16% to 96.11% over the baseline.\n",
      "Most successful computer vision models transform low-level features, such as Gabor filter responses, into richer representations of intermediate or mid-level complexity for downstream visual tasks. These mid-level representations have not been explored for event cameras, although it is especially relevant to the visually sparse and often disjoint spatial information in the event stream. By making use of locally consistent intermediate representations, termed as superevents, numerous visual tasks ranging from semantic segmentation, visual tracking, depth estimation shall benefit. In essence, superevents are perceptually consistent local units that delineate parts of an object in a scene. Inspired by recent deep learning architectures, we present a novel method that employs lifetime augmentation for obtaining an event stream representation that is fed to a fully convolutional network to extract superevents. Our qualitative and quantitative experimental results on several sequences of a benchmark dataset highlights the significant potential for event-based downstream applications.\n",
      "We present an approach, based on learning an intrinsic data manifold, for the initialization of the internal state values of LSTM recurrent neural networks, ensuring consistency with the initial observed input data. Exploiting the generalized synchronization concept, we argue that the converged, \"mature\" internal states constitute a function on this learned manifold. The dimension of this manifold then dictates the length of observed input time series data required for consistent initialization. We illustrate our approach through a partially observed chemical model system, where initializing the internal LSTM states in this fashion yields visibly improved performance. Finally, we show that learning this data manifold enables the transformation of partially observed dynamics into fully observed ones, facilitating alternative identification paths for nonlinear dynamical systems.\n",
      "Recently, a new recurrent neural network (RNN) named the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) was proposed and shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. Here we leverage the linear time-invariant (LTI) memory component of the LMU to construct a simplified variant that can be parallelized during training (and yet executed as an RNN during inference), thus overcoming a well known limitation of training RNNs on GPUs. We show that this reformulation that aids parallelizing, which can be applied generally to any deep network whose recurrent components are linear, makes training up to 200 times faster. Second, to validate its utility, we compare its performance against the original LMU and a variety of published LSTM and transformer networks on seven benchmarks, ranging from psMNIST to sentiment analysis to machine translation. We demonstrate that our models exhibit superior performance on all datasets, often using fewer parameters. For instance, our LMU sets a new state-of-the-art result on psMNIST, and uses half the parameters while outperforming DistilBERT and LSTM models on IMDB sentiment analysis.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have received tremendous attention due to their power in learning effective representations for graphs. Most GNNs follow a message-passing scheme where the node representations are updated by aggregating and transforming the information from the neighborhood. Meanwhile, they adopt the same strategy in aggregating the information from different feature dimensions. However, suggested by social dimension theory and spectral embedding, there are potential benefits to treat the dimensions differently during the aggregation process. In this work, we investigate to enable heterogeneous contributions of feature dimensions in GNNs. In particular, we propose a general graph feature gating network (GFGN) based on the graph signal denoising problem and then correspondingly introduce three graph filters under GFGN to allow different levels of contributions from feature dimensions. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frameworks.\n",
      "Human pose estimation is a major computer vision problem with applications ranging from augmented reality and video capture to surveillance and movement tracking. In the medical context, the latter may be an important biomarker for neurological impairments in infants. Whilst many methods exist, their application has been limited by the need for well annotated large datasets and the inability to generalize to humans of different shapes and body compositions, e.g. children and infants. In this paper we present a novel method for learning pose estimators for human adults and infants in an unsupervised fashion. We approach this as a learnable template matching problem facilitated by deep feature extractors. Human-interpretable landmarks are estimated by transforming a template consisting of predefined body parts that are characterized by 2D Gaussian distributions. Enforcing a connectivity prior guides our model to meaningful human shape representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two different datasets including adults and infants.\n",
      "Algorithms have been fundamental to recent global technological advances and, in particular, they have been the cornerstone of technical advances in one field rapidly being applied to another. We argue that algorithms possess fundamentally different qualities to deep learning methods, and this strongly suggests that, were deep learning methods better able to mimic algorithms, generalisation of the sort seen with algorithms would become possible with deep learning -- something far out of the reach of current machine learning methods. Furthermore, by representing elements in a continuous space of learnt algorithms, neural networks are able to adapt known algorithms more closely to real-world problems, potentially finding more efficient and pragmatic solutions than those proposed by human computer scientists.   Here we present neural algorithmic reasoning -- the art of building neural networks that are able to execute algorithmic computation -- and provide our opinion on its transformative potential for running classical algorithms on inputs previously considered inaccessible to them.\n",
      "Image registration as an important basis in signal processing task often encounter the problem of stability and efficiency. Non-learning registration approaches rely on the optimization of the similarity metrics between the fix and moving images. Yet, those approaches are usually costly in both time and space complexity. The problem can be worse when the size of the image is large or the deformations between the images are severe. Recently, deep learning, or precisely saying, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based image registration methods have been widely investigated in the research community and show promising effectiveness to overcome the weakness of non-learning based methods. To explore the advanced learning approaches in image registration problem for solving practical issues, we present in this paper a method of introducing attention mechanism in deformable image registration problem. The proposed approach is based on learning the deformation field with a Transformer framework (AiR) that does not rely on the CNN but can be efficiently trained on GPGPU devices also. In a more vivid interpretation: we treat the image registration problem as the same as a language translation task and introducing a Transformer to tackle the problem. Our method learns an unsupervised generated deformation map and is tested on two benchmark datasets. The source code of the AiR will be released at Gitlab.\n",
      "Deep neural networks often suffer from overconfidence which can be partly remedied by improved out-of-distribution detection. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach that allows for the generation of out-of-distribution datasets based on a given in-distribution dataset. This new dataset can then be used to improve out-of-distribution detection for the given dataset and machine learning task at hand. The samples in this dataset are with respect to the feature space close to the in-distribution dataset and therefore realistic and plausible. Hence, this dataset can also be used to safeguard neural networks, i.e., to validate the generalization performance. Our approach first generates suitable representations of an in-distribution dataset using an autoencoder and then transforms them using our novel proposed Soft Brownian Offset method. After transformation, the decoder part of the autoencoder allows for the generation of these implicit out-of-distribution samples. This newly generated dataset then allows for mixing with other datasets and thus improved training of an out-of-distribution classifier, increasing its performance. Experimentally, we show that our approach is promising for time series using synthetic data. Using our new method, we also show in a quantitative case study that we can improve the out-of-distribution detection for the MNIST dataset. Finally, we provide another case study on the synthetic generation of out-of-distribution trajectories, which can be used to validate trajectory prediction algorithms for automated driving.\n",
      "\\textit{Graph Neural Network} (GNN) is a promising approach for analyzing graph-structured data that tactfully captures their dependency information via node-level message passing. It has achieved state-of-the-art performances in many tasks, such as node classification, graph matching, clustering, and graph generation. As GNNs operate on non-Euclidean data, their irregular data access patterns cause considerable computational costs and overhead on conventional architectures, such as GPU and CPU. Our analysis shows that GNN adopts a hybrid computing model. The \\textit{Aggregation} (or \\textit{Message Passing}) phase performs vector additions where vectors are fetched with irregular strides. The \\textit{Transformation} (or \\textit{Node Embedding}) phase can be either dense or sparse-dense matrix multiplication. In this work, We propose \\textit{VersaGNN}, an ultra-efficient, systolic-array-based versatile hardware accelerator that unifies dense and sparse matrix multiplication. By applying this single optimized systolic array to both aggregation and transformation phases, we have significantly reduced chip sizes and energy consumption. We then divide the computing engine into blocked systolic arrays to support the \\textit{Strassen}'s algorithm for dense matrix multiplication, dramatically scaling down the number of multiplications and enabling high-throughput computation of GNNs. To balance the workload of sparse-dense matrix multiplication, we also introduced a greedy algorithm to combine sparse sub-matrices of compressed format into condensed ones to reduce computational cycles. Compared with current state-of-the-art GNN software frameworks, \\textit{VersaGNN} achieves on average 3712$\\times$ speedup with 1301.25$\\times$ energy reduction on CPU, and 35.4$\\times$ speedup with 17.66$\\times$ energy reduction on GPU.\n",
      "Motivated by the intuition that one can transform two aligned point clouds to each other more easily and meaningfully than a misaligned pair, we propose CorrNet3D -- the first unsupervised and end-to-end deep learning-based framework -- to drive the learning of dense correspondence between 3D shapes by means of deformation-like reconstruction to overcome the need for annotated data. Specifically, CorrNet3D consists of a deep feature embedding module and two novel modules called correspondence indicator and symmetric deformer. Feeding a pair of raw point clouds, our model first learns the pointwise features and passes them into the indicator to generate a learnable correspondence matrix used to permute the input pair. The symmetric deformer, with an additional regularized loss, transforms the two permuted point clouds to each other to drive the unsupervised learning of the correspondence. The extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets of rigid and non-rigid 3D shapes show our CorrNet3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods to a large extent, including those taking meshes as input. CorrNet3D is a flexible framework in that it can be easily adapted to supervised learning if annotated data are available.

      "The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation.   While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications.   Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.\n",
      "Objective: Accurate evaluation of the root canal filling result in X-ray image is a significant step for the root canal therapy, which is based on the relative position between the apical area boundary of tooth root and the top of filled gutta-percha in root canal as well as the shape of the tooth root and so on to classify the result as correct-filling, under-filling or over-filling. Methods: We propose a novel anatomy-guided Transformer diagnosis network. For obtaining accurate anatomy-guided features, a polynomial curve fitting segmentation is proposed to segment the fuzzy boundary. And a Parallel Bottleneck Transformer network (PBT-Net) is introduced as the classification network for the final evaluation. Results, and conclusion: Our numerical experiments show that our anatomy-guided PBT-Net improves the accuracy from 40\\% to 85\\% relative to the baseline classification network. Comparing with the SOTA segmentation network indicates that the ASD is significantly reduced by 30.3\\% through our fitting segmentation. Significance: Polynomial curve fitting segmentation has a great segmentation effect for extremely fuzzy boundaries. The prior knowledge guided classification network is suitable for the evaluation of root canal therapy greatly.

      "Differentiable rendering is a very successful technique that applies to a Single-View 3D Reconstruction. Current renderers use losses based on pixels between a rendered image of some 3D reconstructed object and ground-truth images from given matched viewpoints to optimise parameters of the 3D shape.   These models require a rendering step, along with visibility handling and evaluation of the shading model. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that we can avoid these steps and still get reconstruction results as other state-of-the-art models that are equal or even better than existing category-specific reconstruction methods. First, we use the same CNN architecture for the prediction of a point cloud shape and pose prediction like the one used by Insafutdinov & Dosovitskiy. Secondly, we propose the novel effective loss function that evaluates how well the projections of reconstructed 3D point clouds cover the ground truth object's silhouette. Then we use Poisson Surface Reconstruction to transform the reconstructed point cloud into a 3D mesh. Finally, we perform a GAN-based texture mapping on a particular 3D mesh and produce a textured 3D mesh from a single 2D image. We evaluate our method on different datasets (including ShapeNet, CUB-200-2011, and Pascal3D+) and achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming all the other supervised and unsupervised methods and 3D representations, all in terms of performance, accuracy, and training time.\n",

Current approaches mainly follow rule-based or CNN+RNN based methodology. However, they seem to underperform on noisy images and images with small number of distinguishable features. To overcome this, we propose an end-to-end transformer model. When compared to attention-based techniques, our proposed model outperforms on molecular datasets.\n",
      "In a real world environment, person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging task due to variations in lighting conditions, viewing angles, pose and occlusions. Despite recent performance gains, current person Re-ID algorithms still suffer heavily when encountering these variations. To address this problem, we propose a semantic consistency and identity mapping multi-component generative adversarial network (SC-IMGAN) which provides style adaptation from one to many domains. To ensure that transformed images are as realistic as possible, we propose novel identity mapping and semantic consistency losses to maintain identity across the diverse domains. For the Re-ID task, we propose a joint verification-identification quartet network which is trained with generated and real images, followed by an effective quartet loss for verification.

      "Motivation: Traditional image attribution methods struggle to satisfactorily explain predictions of neural networks. Prediction explanation is important, especially in medical imaging, for avoiding the unintended consequences of deploying AI systems when false positive predictions can impact patient care. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved models for model explainability and introspection. Specific problem: A new approach is to transform input images to increase or decrease features which cause the prediction. However, current approaches are difficult to implement as they are monolithic or rely on GANs. These hurdles prevent wide adoption. Our approach: Given an arbitrary classifier, we propose a simple autoencoder and gradient update (Latent Shift) that can transform the latent representation of a specific input image to exaggerate or curtail the features used for prediction. We use this method to study chest X-ray classifiers and evaluate their performance. We conduct a reader study with two radiologists assessing 240 chest X-ray predictions to identify which ones are false positives (half are) using traditional attribution maps or our proposed method. Results: We found low overlap with ground truth pathology masks for models with reasonably high accuracy. However, the results from our reader study indicate that these models are generally looking at the correct features. We also found that the Latent Shift explanation allows a user to have more confidence in true positive predictions compared to traditional approaches (0.15$\\pm$0.95 in a 5 point scale with p=0.01) with only a small increase in false positive predictions (0.04$\\pm$1.06 with p=0.57).

      "Visual relationship recognition (VRR) is a fundamental scene understanding task. The structure that VRR provides is essential to improve the AI interpretability in downstream tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. Several recent studies showed that the long-tail problem in VRR is even more critical than that in object recognition due to the compositional complexity and structure. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel transformer-based framework, dubbed as RelTransformer, which performs relationship prediction using rich semantic features from multiple image levels. We assume that more abundantcon textual features can generate more accurate and discriminative relationships, which can be useful when sufficient training data are lacking. The key feature of our model is its ability to aggregate three different-level features (local context, scene, and dataset-level) to compositionally predict the visual relationship. We evaluate our model on the visual genome and two \"long-tail\" VRR datasets, GQA-LT and VG8k-LT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RelTransformer could improve over the state-of-the-art baselines on all the datasets. In addition, our model significantly improves the accuracy of GQA-LT by 27.4% upon the best baselines on tail-relationship prediction.

      "Recently,~\\citet{liu:arxiv:2019} studied the rather challenging problem of time series forecasting from the perspective of compressed sensing. They proposed a no-learning method, named Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization (CNNM), and proved that CNNM can exactly recover the future part of a series from its observed part, provided that the series is convolutionally low-rank. While impressive, the convolutional low-rankness condition may not be satisfied whenever the series is far from being seasonal, and is in fact brittle to the presence of trends and dynamics. This paper tries to approach the issues by integrating a learnable, orthonormal transformation into CNNM, with the purpose for converting the series of involute structures into regular signals of convolutionally low-rank. We prove that the resulted model, termed Learning-Based CNNM (LbCNNM), strictly succeeds in identifying the future part of a series, as long as the transform of the series is convolutionally low-rank. To learn proper transformations that may meet the required success conditions, we devise an interpretable method based on Principal Component Purist (PCP). Equipped with this learning method and some elaborate data argumentation skills, LbCNNM not only can handle well the major components of time series (including trends, seasonality and dynamics), but also can make use of the forecasts provided by some other forecasting methods; this means LbCNNM can be used as a general tool for model combination. Extensive experiments on 100,452 real-world time series from TSDL and M4 demonstrate the superior performance of LbCNNM.\n",
      "We present Multiscale Vision Transformers (MViT) for video and image recognition, by connecting the seminal idea of multiscale feature hierarchies with transformer models. Multiscale Transformers have several channel-resolution scale stages. Starting from the input resolution and a small channel dimension, the stages hierarchically expand the channel capacity while reducing the spatial resolution. This creates a multiscale pyramid of features with early layers operating at high spatial resolution to model simple low-level visual information, and deeper layers at spatially coarse, but complex, high-dimensional features. We evaluate this fundamental architectural prior for modeling the dense nature of visual signals for a variety of video recognition tasks where it outperforms concurrent vision transformers that rely on large scale external pre-training and are 5-10x more costly in computation and parameters. We further remove the temporal dimension and apply our model for image classification where it outperforms prior work on vision transformers.

      "Recently the vision transformer (ViT) architecture, where the backbone purely consists of self-attention mechanism, has achieved very promising performance in visual classification. However, the high performance of the original ViT heavily depends on pretraining using ultra large-scale datasets, and it significantly underperforms on ImageNet-1K if trained from scratch. This paper makes the efforts toward addressing this problem, by carefully considering the role of visual tokens. First, for classification head, existing ViT only exploits class token while entirely neglecting rich semantic information inherent in high-level visual tokens. Therefore, we propose a new classification paradigm, where the second-order, cross-covariance pooling of visual tokens is combined with class token for final classification. Meanwhile, a fast singular value power normalization is proposed for improving the second-order pooling. Second, the original ViT employs the naive embedding of fixed-size image patches, lacking the ability to model translation equivariance and locality. To alleviate this problem, we develop a light-weight, hierarchical module based on off-the-shelf convolutions for visual token embedding. The proposed architecture, which we call So-ViT, is thoroughly evaluated on ImageNet-1K. The results show our models, when trained from scratch, outperform the competing ViT variants, while being on par with or better than state-of-the-art CNN models.

Given a single hyper-parameter expressing the desired balance between the quantized model size and accuracy, DiffQ can optimize the number of bits used per individual weight or groups of weights, in a single training. We experimentally verify that our method outperforms state-of-the-art quantization techniques on several benchmarks and architectures for image classification, language modeling, and audio source separation. For instance, on the Wikitext-103 language modeling benchmark, DiffQ compresses a 16 layers transformer model by a factor of 8, equivalent to 4 bits precision, while losing only 0.5 points of perplexity.

      "We study the problem of predicting and controlling the future state distribution of an autonomous agent. This problem, which can be viewed as a reframing of goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL), is centered around learning a conditional probability density function over future states. Instead of directly estimating this density function, we indirectly estimate this density function by training a classifier to predict whether an observation comes from the future. Via Bayes' rule, predictions from our classifier can be transformed into predictions over future states. Importantly, an off-policy variant of our algorithm allows us to predict the future state distribution of a new policy, without collecting new experience. This variant allows us to optimize functionals of a policy's future state distribution, such as the density of reaching a particular goal state. While conceptually similar to Q-learning, our work lays a principled foundation for goal-conditioned RL as density estimation, providing justification for goal-conditioned methods used in prior work. This foundation makes hypotheses about Q-learning, including the optimal goal-sampling ratio, which we confirm experimentally. Moreover, our proposed method is competitive with prior goal-conditioned RL methods.\n",
      "Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem due to the severe information degeneration. However, existing deep learning based dehazing methods only adopt clear images as positive samples to guide the training of dehazing network while negative information is unexploited. Moreover, most of them focus on strengthening the dehazing network with an increase of depth and width, leading to a significant requirement of computation and memory. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to exploit both the information of hazy images and clear images as negative and positive samples, respectively. CR ensures that the restored image is pulled to closer to the clear image and pushed to far away from the hazy image in the representation space. Furthermore, considering trade-off between performance and memory storage, we develop a compact dehazing network based on autoencoder-like (AE) framework. It involves an adaptive mixup operation and a dynamic feature enhancement module, which can benefit from preserving information flow adaptively and expanding the receptive field to improve the network's transformation capability, respectively. We term our dehazing network with autoencoder and contrastive regularization as AECR-Net. The extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our AECR-Net surpass the state-of-the-art approaches. The code is released in https://github.com/GlassyWu/AECR-Net.\n",
      "Depending on the application, radiological diagnoses can be associated with high inter- and intra-rater variabilities. Most computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) solutions treat such data as incontrovertible, exposing learning algorithms to considerable and possibly contradictory label noise and biases. Thus, managing subjectivity in labels is a fundamental problem in medical imaging analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce auto-decoded deep latent embeddings (ADDLE), which explicitly models the tendencies of each rater using an auto-decoder framework. After a simple linear transformation, the latent variables can be injected into any backbone at any and multiple points, allowing the model to account for rater-specific effects on the diagnosis. Importantly, ADDLE does not expect multiple raters per image in training, meaning it can readily learn from data mined from hospital archives. Moreover, the complexity of training ADDLE does not increase as more raters are added. During inference each rater can be simulated and a 'mean' or 'greedy' virtual rating can be produced. We test ADDLE on the problem of liver steatosis diagnosis from 2D ultrasound (US) by collecting 46 084 studies along with clinical US diagnoses originating from 65 different raters. We evaluated diagnostic performance using a separate dataset with gold-standard biopsy diagnoses. ADDLE can improve the partial areas under the curve (AUCs) for diagnosing severe steatosis by 10.5% over standard classifiers while outperforming other annotator-noise approaches, including those requiring 65 times the parameters.\n",
      "Substantial progress has been made on modeling rigid 3D objects using deep implicit representations. Yet, extending these methods to learn neural models of human shape is still in its infancy. Human bodies are complex and the key challenge is to learn a representation that generalizes such that it can express body shape deformations for unseen subjects in unseen, highly-articulated, poses. To address this challenge, we introduce LEAP (LEarning Articulated occupancy of People), a novel neural occupancy representation of the human body. Given a set of bone transformations (i.e. joint locations and rotations) and a query point in space, LEAP first maps the query point to a canonical space via learned linear blend skinning (LBS) functions and then efficiently queries the occupancy value via an occupancy network that models accurate identity- and pose-dependent deformations in the canonical space. Experiments show that our canonicalized occupancy estimation with the learned LBS functions greatly improves the generalization capability of the learned occupancy representation across various human shapes and poses, outperforming existing solutions in all settings.\n",
      "A common shortfall of supervised learning for medical imaging is the greedy need for human annotations, which is often expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This paper proposes a semi-supervised classification method for three kinds of apicomplexan parasites and non-infected host cells microscopic images, which uses a small number of labeled data and a large number of unlabeled data for training. There are two challenges in microscopic image recognition. The first is that salient structures of the microscopic images are more fuzzy and intricate than natural images' on a real-world scale. The second is that insignificant textures, like background staining, lightness, and contrast level, vary a lot in samples from different clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we aim to learn a distinguishable and appearance-invariant representation by contrastive learning strategy. On one hand, macroscopic images, which share similar shape characteristics in morphology, are introduced to contrast for structure enhancement. On the other hand, different appearance transformations, including color distortion and flittering, are utilized to contrast for texture elimination. In the case where only 1% of microscopic images are labeled, the proposed method reaches an accuracy of 94.90% in a generalized testing set.\n",
      "One strategy for adversarially training a robust model is to maximize its certified radius -- the neighborhood around a given training sample for which the model's prediction remains unchanged. The scheme typically involves analyzing a \"smoothed\" classifier where one estimates the prediction corresponding to Gaussian samples in the neighborhood of each sample in the mini-batch, accomplished in practice by Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that this sampling bottleneck can potentially be mitigated by identifying ways to directly propagate the covariance matrix of the smoothed distribution through the network. To this end, we find that other than certain adjustments to the network, propagating the covariances must also be accompanied by additional accounting that keeps track of how the distributional moments transform and interact at each stage in the network. We show how satisfying these criteria yields an algorithm for maximizing the certified radius on datasets including Cifar-10, ImageNet, and Places365 while offering runtime savings on networks with moderate depth, with a small compromise in overall accuracy. We describe the details of the key modifications that enable practical use. Via various experiments, we evaluate when our simplifications are sensible, and what the key benefits and limitations are.\n",
      "Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are envisioned to transform the future industrial and private transportation sectors. Due to the complexity of the systems, functional verification and validation of safety aspects are essential before the technology merges into the public domain. In recent years, a scenario-driven approach has gained acceptance for CAVs emphasizing the requirement of a solid data basis of scenarios. The large-scale research facility Test Bed Lower Saxony (TFNDS) enables the provision of substantial information for a database of scenarios on motorways. For that purpose, however, the scenarios of interest must be identified and categorized in the collected trajectory data. This work addresses this problem and proposes a framework for on-ramp scenario identification that also enables for scenario categorization and assessment. The efficacy of the framework is shown with a dataset collected on the TFNDS.\n",
      "Recent studies have witnessed that self-supervised methods based on view synthesis obtain clear progress on multi-view stereo (MVS). However, existing methods rely on the assumption that the corresponding points among different views share the same color, which may not always be true in practice. This may lead to unreliable self-supervised signal and harm the final reconstruction performance. To address the issue, we propose a framework integrated with more reliable supervision guided by semantic co-segmentation and data-augmentation. Specially, we excavate mutual semantic from multi-view images to guide the semantic consistency. And we devise effective data-augmentation mechanism which ensures the transformation robustness by treating the prediction of regular samples as pseudo ground truth to regularize the prediction of augmented samples. Experimental results on DTU dataset show that our proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, and even compete on par with supervised methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments on Tanks&Temples dataset demonstrate the effective generalization ability of the proposed method.\n",
      "The problem of inhomogeneous cluster densities has been a long-standing issue for distance-based and density-based algorithms in clustering and anomaly detection. These algorithms implicitly assume that all clusters have approximately the same density. As a result, they often exhibit a bias towards dense clusters in the presence of sparse clusters. Many remedies have been suggested; yet, we show that they are partial solutions which do not address the issue satisfactorily. To match the implicit assumption, we propose to transform a given dataset such that the transformed clusters have approximately the same density while all regions of locally low density become globally low density -- homogenising cluster density while preserving the cluster structure of the dataset. We show that this can be achieved by using a new multi-dimensional Cumulative Distribution Function in a transform-and-shift method. The method can be applied to every dataset, before the dataset is used in many existing algorithms to match their implicit assumption without algorithmic modification. We show that the proposed method performs better than existing remedies.\n",
      "Camera pose regression methods apply a single forward pass to the query image to estimate the camera pose. As such, they offer a fast and light-weight alternative to traditional localization schemes based on image retrieval. Pose regression approaches simultaneously learn two regression tasks, aiming to jointly estimate the camera position and orientation using a single embedding vector computed by a convolutional backbone. We propose an attention-based approach for pose regression, where the convolutional activation maps are used as sequential inputs. Transformers are applied to encode the sequential activation maps as latent vectors, used for camera pose regression. This allows us to pay attention to spatially-varying deep features. Using two Transformer heads, we separately focus on the features for camera position and orientation, based on how informative they are per task. Our proposed approach is shown to compare favorably to contemporary pose regressors schemes and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple outdoor and indoor benchmarks. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, our approach is the only method to attain sub-meter average accuracy across outdoor scenes. We make our code publicly available from here.\n",
      "When making decisions, people often overlook critical information or are overly swayed by irrelevant information. A common approach to mitigate these biases is to provide decision-makers, especially professionals such as medical doctors, with decision aids, such as decision trees and flowcharts. Designing effective decision aids is a difficult problem. We propose that recently developed reinforcement learning methods for discovering clever heuristics for good decision-making can be partially leveraged to assist human experts in this design process. One of the biggest remaining obstacles to leveraging the aforementioned methods is that the policies they learn are opaque to people. To solve this problem, we introduce AI-Interpret: a general method for transforming idiosyncratic policies into simple and interpretable descriptions. Our algorithm combines recent advances in imitation learning and program induction with a new clustering method for identifying a large subset of demonstrations that can be accurately described by a simple, high-performing decision rule. We evaluate our new algorithm and employ it to translate information-acquisition policies discovered through metalevel reinforcement learning. The results of large behavioral experiments showed that prividing the decision rules generated by AI-Interpret as flowcharts significantly improved people's planning strategies and decisions across three diferent classes of sequential decision problems. Moreover, another experiment revealed that this approach is significantly more effective than training people by giving them performance feedback. Finally, a series of ablation studies confirmed that AI-Interpret is critical to the discovery of interpretable decision rules. We conclude that the methods and findings presented herein are an important step towards leveraging automatic strategy discovery to improve human decision-making.\n",
      "Extracting robust and general 3D local features is key to downstream tasks such as point cloud registration and reconstruction. Existing learning-based local descriptors are either sensitive to rotation transformations, or rely on classical handcrafted features which are neither general nor representative. In this paper, we introduce a new, yet conceptually simple, neural architecture, termed SpinNet, to extract local features which are rotationally invariant whilst sufficiently informative to enable accurate registration. A Spatial Point Transformer is first introduced to map the input local surface into a carefully designed cylindrical space, enabling end-to-end optimization with SO(2) equivariant representation. A Neural Feature Extractor which leverages the powerful point-based and 3D cylindrical convolutional neural layers is then utilized to derive a compact and representative descriptor for matching. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that SpinNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques by a large margin. More critically, it has the best generalization ability across unseen scenarios with different sensor modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/QingyongHu/SpinNet.\n",
      "Before deploying machine learning models it is critical to assess their robustness. In the context of deep neural networks for image understanding, changing the object location, rotation and size may affect the predictions in non-trivial ways. In this work we perform a fine-grained analysis of robustness with respect to these factors of variation using SI-Score, a synthetic dataset. In particular, we investigate ResNets, Vision Transformers and CLIP, and identify interesting qualitative differences between these.\n",
      "There exists an apparent negative correlation between performance and interpretability of deep learning models. In an effort to reduce this negative correlation, we propose a Born Identity Network (BIN), which is a post-hoc approach for producing multi-way counterfactual maps. A counterfactual map transforms an input sample to be conditioned and classified as a target label, which is similar to how humans process knowledge through counterfactual thinking. For example, a counterfactual map can localize hypothetical abnormalities from a normal brain image that may cause it to be diagnosed with a disease. Specifically, our proposed BIN consists of two core components: Counterfactual Map Generator and Target Attribution Network. The Counterfactual Map Generator is a variation of conditional GAN which can synthesize a counterfactual map conditioned on an arbitrary target label. The Target Attribution Network provides adequate assistance for generating synthesized maps by conditioning a target label into the Counterfactual Map Generator. We have validated our proposed BIN in qualitative and quantitative analysis on MNIST, 3D Shapes, and ADNI datasets, and showed the comprehensibility and fidelity of our method from various ablation studies.\n",
      "This paper presents DeepI2P: a novel approach for cross-modality registration between an image and a point cloud. Given an image (e.g. from a rgb-camera) and a general point cloud (e.g. from a 3D Lidar scanner) captured at different locations in the same scene, our method estimates the relative rigid transformation between the coordinate frames of the camera and Lidar. Learning common feature descriptors to establish correspondences for the registration is inherently challenging due to the lack of appearance and geometric correlations across the two modalities. We circumvent the difficulty by converting the registration problem into a classification and inverse camera projection optimization problem. A classification neural network is designed to label whether the projection of each point in the point cloud is within or beyond the camera frustum. These labeled points are subsequently passed into a novel inverse camera projection solver to estimate the relative pose. Extensive experimental results on Oxford Robotcar and KITTI datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/lijx10/DeepI2P\n",
      "Tasks that rely on multi-modal information typically include a fusion module that combines information from different modalities. In this work, we develop a Refiner Fusion Network (ReFNet) that enables fusion modules to combine strong unimodal representation with strong multimodal representations. ReFNet combines the fusion network with a decoding/defusing module, which imposes a modality-centric responsibility condition. This approach addresses a big gap in existing multimodal fusion frameworks by ensuring that both unimodal and fused representations are strongly encoded in the latent fusion space. We demonstrate that the Refiner Fusion Network can improve upon performance of powerful baseline fusion modules such as multimodal transformers. The refiner network enables inducing graphical representations of the fused embeddings in the latent space, which we prove under certain conditions and is supported by strong empirical results in the numerical experiments. These graph structures are further strengthened by combining the ReFNet with a Multi-Similarity contrastive loss function. The modular nature of Refiner Fusion Network lends itself to be combined with different fusion architectures easily, and in addition, the refiner step can be applied for pre-training on unlabeled datasets, thus leveraging unsupervised data towards improving performance. We demonstrate the power of Refiner Fusion Networks on three datasets, and further show that they can maintain performance with only a small fraction of labeled data.\n",
      "In this paper, we address the problem of makeup transfer, which aims at transplanting the makeup from the reference face to the source face while preserving the identity of the source. Existing makeup transfer methods have made notable progress in generating realistic makeup faces, but do not perform well in terms of color fidelity and spatial transformation. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Facial Attribute Transformer (FAT) and its variant Spatial FAT for high-quality makeup transfer. Drawing inspirations from the Transformer in NLP, FAT is able to model the semantic correspondences and interactions between the source face and reference face, and then precisely estimate and transfer the facial attributes. To further facilitate shape deformation and transformation of facial parts, we also integrate thin plate splines (TPS) into FAT, thus creating Spatial FAT, which is the first method that can transfer geometric attributes in addition to color and texture. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed FATs in the following aspects: (1) ensuring high-fidelity color transfer; (2) allowing for geometric transformation of facial parts; (3) handling facial variations (such as poses and shadows) and (4) supporting high-resolution face generation.\n",
      "Face reenactment is a challenging task, as it is difficult to maintain accurate expression, pose and identity simultaneously. Most existing methods directly apply driving facial landmarks to reenact source faces and ignore the intrinsic gap between two identities, resulting in the identity mismatch issue. Besides, they neglect the entanglement of expression and pose features when encoding driving faces, leading to inaccurate expressions and visual artifacts on large-pose reenacted faces. To address these problems, we propose a Large-pose Identity-preserving face reenactment network, LI-Net. Specifically, the Landmark Transformer is adopted to adjust driving landmark images, which aims to narrow the identity gap between driving and source landmark images. Then the Face Rotation Module and the Expression Enhancing Generator decouple the transformed landmark image into pose and expression features, and reenact those attributes separately to generate identity-preserving faces with accurate expressions and poses. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.\n",
      "Shapley values have become one of the most popular feature attribution explanation methods. However, most prior work has focused on post-hoc Shapley explanations, which can be computationally demanding due to its exponential time complexity and preclude model regularization based on Shapley explanations during training. Thus, we propose to incorporate Shapley values themselves as latent representations in deep models thereby making Shapley explanations first-class citizens in the modeling paradigm. This intrinsic explanation approach enables layer-wise explanations, explanation regularization of the model during training, and fast explanation computation at test time. We define the Shapley transform that transforms the input into a Shapley representation given a specific function. We operationalize the Shapley transform as a neural network module and construct both shallow and deep networks, called ShapNets, by composing Shapley modules. We prove that our Shallow ShapNets compute the exact Shapley values and our Deep ShapNets maintain the missingness and accuracy properties of Shapley values. We demonstrate on synthetic and real-world datasets that our ShapNets enable layer-wise Shapley explanations, novel Shapley regularizations during training, and fast computation while maintaining reasonable performance.

      "Despite exciting progress in pre-training for visual-linguistic (VL) representations, very few aspire to a small VL model. In this paper, we study knowledge distillation (KD) to effectively compress a transformer-based large VL model into a small VL model. The major challenge arises from the inconsistent regional visual tokens extracted from different detectors of Teacher and Student, resulting in the misalignment of hidden representations and attention distributions. To address the problem, we retrain and adapt the Teacher by using the same region proposals from Student's detector while the features are from Teacher's own object detector. With aligned network inputs, the adapted Teacher is capable of transferring the knowledge through the intermediate representations. Specifically, we use the mean square error loss to mimic the attention distribution inside the transformer block and present a token-wise noise contrastive loss to align the hidden state by contrasting with negative representations stored in a sample queue. To this end, we show that our proposed distillation significantly improves the performance of small VL models on image captioning and visual question answering tasks. It reaches 120.8 in CIDEr score on COCO captioning, an improvement of 5.1 over its non-distilled counterpart; and an accuracy of 69.8 on VQA 2.0, a 0.8 gain from the baseline. Our extensive experiments and ablations confirm the effectiveness of VL distillation in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages.\n",
      "Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to retrieve video sequences of the same person under non-overlapping cameras. Previous methods usually focus on limited views, such as spatial, temporal or spatial-temporal view, which lack of the observations in different feature domains. To capture richer perceptions and extract more comprehensive video representations, in this paper we propose a novel framework named Trigeminal Transformers (TMT) for video-based person Re-ID. More specifically, we design a trigeminal feature extractor to jointly transform raw video data into spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal domain. Besides, inspired by the great success of vision transformer, we introduce the transformer structure for video-based person Re-ID. In our work, three self-view transformers are proposed to exploit the relationships between local features for information enhancement in spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal domains. Moreover, a cross-view transformer is proposed to aggregate the multi-view features for comprehensive video representations. The experimental results indicate that our approach can achieve better performance than other state-of-the-art approaches on public Re-ID benchmarks. We will release the code for model reproduction.\n",
      "Deepfake is the manipulated video made with a generative deep learning technique such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Auto Encoder that anyone can utilize. Recently, with the increase of Deepfake videos, some classifiers consisting of the convolutional neural network that can distinguish fake videos as well as deepfake datasets have been actively created. However, the previous studies based on the CNN structure have the problem of not only overfitting, but also considerable misjudging fake video as real ones. In this paper, we propose a Vision Transformer model with distillation methodology for detecting fake videos. We design that a CNN features and patch-based positioning model learns to interact with all positions to find the artifact region for solving false negative problem. Through comparative analysis on Deepfake Detection (DFDC) Dataset, we verify that the proposed scheme with patch embedding as input outperforms the state-of-the-art using the combined CNN features. Without ensemble technique, our model obtains 0.978 of AUC and 91.9 of f1 score, while previous SOTA model yields 0.972 of AUC and 90.6 of f1 score on the same condition.\n",
      "This paper defines a new visual reasoning paradigm by introducing an important factor, i.e.~transformation. The motivation comes from the fact that most existing visual reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR in VQA, are solely defined to test how well the machine understands the concepts and relations within static settings, like one image. We argue that this kind of \\textbf{state driven visual reasoning} approach has limitations in reflecting whether the machine has the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which has been shown as important as state-level reasoning for human cognition in Piaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel \\textbf{transformation driven visual reasoning} task. Given both the initial and final states, the target is to infer the corresponding single-step or multi-step transformation, represented as a triplet (object, attribute, value) or a sequence of triplets, respectively. Following this definition, a new dataset namely TRANCE is constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three levels of settings, i.e.~Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views). Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event and View. We believe the proposed new paradigm will boost the development of machine visual reasoning. More advanced methods and real data need to be investigated in this direction.

      "Data augmentation refers to a wide range of techniques for improving model generalization by augmenting training examples. Oftentimes such methods require domain knowledge about the dataset at hand, spawning a plethora of recent literature surrounding automated techniques for data augmentation. In this work we apply one such method, bilevel optimization, to tackle the problem of graph classification on the ogbg-molhiv dataset. Our best performing augmentation achieved a test ROCAUC score of 77.77 % with a GIN+virtual classifier, which makes it the most effective augmenter for this classifier on the leaderboard. This framework combines a GIN layer augmentation generator with a bias transformation and outperforms the same classifier augmented using the state-of-the-art FLAG augmentation.\n",
      "Predictive business process monitoring focuses on predicting future characteristics of a running process using event logs. The foresight into process execution promises great potentials for efficient operations, better resource management, and effective customer services. Deep learning-based approaches have been widely adopted in process mining to address the limitations of classical algorithms for solving multiple problems, especially the next event and remaining-time prediction tasks. Nevertheless, designing a deep neural architecture that performs competitively across various tasks is challenging as existing methods fail to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequences and perform poorly for lengthy process traces. In this paper, we propose ProcessTransformer, an approach for learning high-level representations from event logs with an attention-based network. Our model incorporates long-range memory and relies on a self-attention mechanism to establish dependencies between a multitude of event sequences and corresponding outputs. We evaluate the applicability of our technique on nine real event logs. We demonstrate that the transformer-based model outperforms several baselines of prior techniques by obtaining on average above 80% accuracy for the task of predicting the next activity. Our method also perform competitively, compared to baselines, for the tasks of predicting event time and remaining time of a running case\n",
      "We present DietNeRF, a 3D neural scene representation estimated from a few images. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) learn a continuous volumetric representation of a scene through multi-view consistency, and can be rendered from novel viewpoints by ray casting. While NeRF has an impressive ability to reconstruct geometry and fine details given many images, up to 100 for challenging 360{\\deg} scenes, it often finds a degenerate solution to its image reconstruction objective when only a few input views are available. To improve few-shot quality, we propose DietNeRF. We introduce an auxiliary semantic consistency loss that encourages realistic renderings at novel poses. DietNeRF is trained on individual scenes to (1) correctly render given input views from the same pose, and (2) match high-level semantic attributes across different, random poses. Our semantic loss allows us to supervise DietNeRF from arbitrary poses. We extract these semantics using a pre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diverse single-view, 2D photographs mined from the web with natural language supervision. In experiments, DietNeRF improves the perceptual quality of few-shot view synthesis when learned from scratch, can render novel views with as few as one observed image when pre-trained on a multi-view dataset, and produces plausible completions of completely unobserved regions.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are able to generate high-quality images, but it remains difficult to explicitly specify the semantics of synthesized images. In this work, we aim to better understand the semantic representation of GANs, and thereby enable semantic control in GAN's generation process. Interestingly, we find that a well-trained GAN encodes image semantics in its internal feature maps in a surprisingly simple way: a linear transformation of feature maps suffices to extract the generated image semantics. To verify this simplicity, we conduct extensive experiments on various GANs and datasets; and thanks to this simplicity, we are able to learn a semantic segmentation model for a trained GAN from a small number (e.g., 8) of labeled images. Last but not least, leveraging our findings, we propose two few-shot image editing approaches, namely Semantic-Conditional Sampling and Semantic Image Editing. Given a trained GAN and as few as eight semantic annotations, the user is able to generate diverse images subject to a user-provided semantic layout, and control the synthesized image semantics. We have made the code publicly available.\n",
      "The generation of plausible and controllable 3D human motion animations is a long-standing problem that often requires a manual intervention of skilled artists. Existing machine learning approaches try to semi-automate this process by allowing the user to input partial information about the future movement. However, they are limited in two significant ways: they either base their pose prediction on past prior frames with no additional control over the future poses or allow the user to input only a single trajectory that precludes fine-grained control over the output. To mitigate these two issues, we reformulate the problem of future pose prediction into pose completion in space and time where trajectories are represented as poses with missing joints. We show that such a framework can generalize to other neural networks designed for future pose prediction. Once trained in this framework, a model is capable of predicting sequences from any number of trajectories. To leverage this notion, we propose a novel transformer-like architecture, TrajeVAE, that provides a versatile framework for 3D human animation. We demonstrate that TrajeVAE outperforms trajectory-based reference approaches and methods that base their predictions on past poses in terms of accuracy. We also show that it can predict reasonable future poses even if provided only with an initial pose.\n",
      "Point cloud analysis is still a challenging task due to the disorder and sparsity of samplings of their geometric structures from 3D sensors. In this paper, we introduce the homotopy equivalence relation (HER) to make the neural networks learn the data distribution from a high-dimension manifold. A shuffle operation is adopted to construct HER for its randomness and zero-parameter. In addition, inspired by prior works, we propose a local mutual information regularizer (LMIR) to cut off the trivial path that leads to a classification error from HER. LMIR utilizes mutual information to measure the distance between the original feature and HER transformed feature and learns common features in a contrastive learning scheme. Thus, we combine HER and LMIR to give our model the ability to learn non-Euclidean features from a high-dimension manifold. This is named the non-Euclidean feature learner. Furthermore, we propose a new heuristics and efficiency point sampling algorithm named ClusterFPS to obtain approximate uniform sampling but at faster speed. ClusterFPS uses a cluster algorithm to divide a point cloud into several clusters and deploy the farthest point sampling algorithm on each cluster in parallel. By combining the above methods, we propose a novel point cloud analysis neural network called PointShuffleNet (PSN), which shows great promise in point cloud classification and segmentation. Extensive experiments show that our PSN achieves state-of-the-art results on ModelNet40, ShapeNet and S3DIS with high efficiency. Theoretically, we provide mathematical analysis toward understanding of what the data distribution HER has developed and why LMIR can drop the trivial path by maximizing mutual information implicitly.\n",
      "An important goal of neural architecture search (NAS) is to automate-away the design of neural networks on new tasks in under-explored domains. Motivated by this broader vision for NAS, we study the problem of enabling users to discover the right neural operations given data from their specific domain. We introduce a search space of neural operations called XD-Operations that mimic the inductive bias of standard multichannel convolutions while being much more expressive: we prove that XD-operations include many named operations across several application areas. Starting with any standard backbone network such as LeNet or ResNet, we show how to transform it into an architecture search space over XD-operations and how to traverse the space using a simple weight-sharing scheme. On a diverse set of applications--image classification, solving partial differential equations (PDEs), and sequence modeling--our approach consistently yields models with lower error than baseline networks and sometimes even lower error than expert-designed domain-specific approaches.\n",
      "Following the success in advancing natural language processing and understanding, transformers are expected to bring revolutionary changes to computer vision. This work provides the first and comprehensive study on the robustness of vision transformers (ViTs) against adversarial perturbations. Tested on various white-box and transfer attack settings, we find that ViTs possess better adversarial robustness when compared with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We summarize the following main observations contributing to the improved robustness of ViTs:   1) Features learned by ViTs contain less low-level information and are more generalizable, which contributes to superior robustness against adversarial perturbations.   2) Introducing convolutional or tokens-to-token blocks for learning low-level features in ViTs can improve classification accuracy but at the cost of adversarial robustness.   3) Increasing the proportion of transformers in the model structure (when the model consists of both transformer and CNN blocks) leads to better robustness. But for a pure transformer model, simply increasing the size or adding layers cannot guarantee a similar effect.   4) Pre-training on larger datasets does not significantly improve adversarial robustness though it is critical for training ViTs.   5) Adversarial training is also applicable to ViT for training robust models.   Furthermore, feature visualization and frequency analysis are conducted for explanation. The results show that ViTs are less sensitive to high-frequency perturbations than CNNs and there is a high correlation between how well the model learns low-level features and its robustness against different frequency-based perturbations.\n",
      "Many applications of machine learning on discrete domains, such as learning preference functions in recommender systems or auctions, can be reduced to estimating a set function that is sparse in the Fourier domain. In this work, we present a new family of algorithms for learning Fourier-sparse set functions. They require at most $nk - k \\log_2 k + k$ queries (set function evaluations), under mild conditions on the Fourier coefficients, where $n$ is the size of the ground set and $k$ the number of non-zero Fourier coefficients. In contrast to other work that focused on the orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard transform, our novel algorithms operate with recently introduced non-orthogonal Fourier transforms that offer different notions of Fourier-sparsity. These naturally arise when modeling, e.g., sets of items forming substitutes and complements. We demonstrate effectiveness on several real-world applications.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a novel framework to translate a portrait photo-face into an anime appearance. Our aim is to synthesize anime-faces which are style-consistent with a given reference anime-face. However, unlike typical translation tasks, such anime-face translation is challenging due to complex variations of appearances among anime-faces. Existing methods often fail to transfer the styles of reference anime-faces, or introduce noticeable artifacts/distortions in the local shapes of their generated faces. We propose AniGAN, a novel GAN-based translator that synthesizes high-quality anime-faces. Specifically, a new generator architecture is proposed to simultaneously transfer color/texture styles and transform local facial shapes into anime-like counterparts based on the style of a reference anime-face, while preserving the global structure of the source photo-face. We propose a double-branch discriminator to learn both domain-specific distributions and domain-shared distributions, helping generate visually pleasing anime-faces and effectively mitigate artifacts. Extensive experiments on selfie2anime and a new face2anime dataset qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods. The new dataset is available at https://github.com/bing-li-ai/AniGAN .\n",
      "Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a $ProbSparse$ self-attention mechanism, which achieves $O(L \\log L)$ in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.\n",
      "Deep object recognition models have been very successful over benchmark datasets such as ImageNet. How accurate and robust are they to distribution shifts arising from natural and synthetic variations in datasets? Prior research on this problem has primarily focused on ImageNet variations (e.g., ImageNetV2, ImageNet-A). To avoid potential inherited biases in these studies, we take a different approach. Specifically, we reanalyze the ObjectNet dataset recently proposed by Barbu et al. containing objects in daily life situations. They showed a dramatic performance drop of the state of the art object recognition models on this dataset. Due to the importance and implications of their results regarding the generalization ability of deep models, we take a second look at their analysis. We find that applying deep models to the isolated objects, rather than the entire scene as is done in the original paper, results in around 20-30% performance improvement. Relative to the numbers reported in Barbu et al., around 10-15% of the performance loss is recovered, without any test time data augmentation. Despite this gain, however, we conclude that deep models still suffer drastically on the ObjectNet dataset. We also investigate the robustness of models against synthetic image perturbations such as geometric transformations (e.g., scale, rotation, translation), natural image distortions (e.g., impulse noise, blur) as well as adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM and PGD-5). Our results indicate that limiting the object area as much as possible (i.e., from the entire image to the bounding box to the segmentation mask) leads to consistent improvement in accuracy and robustness.\n",
      "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have long been the architecture of choice for computer vision tasks. Recently, Transformer-based architectures like Vision Transformer (ViT) have matched or even surpassed ResNets for image classification. However, details of the Transformer architecture -- such as the use of non-overlapping patches -- lead one to wonder whether these networks are as robust. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of a variety of different measures of robustness of ViT models and compare the findings to ResNet baselines. We investigate robustness to input perturbations as well as robustness to model perturbations. We find that when pre-trained with a sufficient amount of data, ViT models are at least as robust as the ResNet counterparts on a broad range of perturbations. We also find that Transformers are robust to the removal of almost any single layer, and that while activations from later layers are highly correlated with each other, they nevertheless play an important role in classification.\n",
      "Classifying samples as in-distribution or out-of-distribution (OOD) is a challenging problem of anomaly detection and a strong test of the generalisation power for models of the in-distribution. In this paper, we present a simple and generic framework, {\\it SemSAD}, that makes use of a semantic similarity score to carry out anomaly detection. The idea is to first find for any test example the semantically closest examples in the training set, where the semantic relation between examples is quantified by the cosine similarity between feature vectors that leave semantics unchanged under transformations, such as geometric transformations (images), time shifts (audio signals), and synonymous word substitutions (text). A trained discriminator is then used to classify a test example as OOD if the semantic similarity to its nearest neighbours is significantly lower than the corresponding similarity for test examples from the in-distribution. We are able to outperform previous approaches for anomaly, novelty, or out-of-distribution detection in the visual domain by a large margin. In particular, we obtain AUROC values close to one for the challenging task of detecting examples from CIFAR-10 as out-of-distribution given CIFAR-100 as in-distribution, without making use of label information.\n",
      "As neural networks are increasingly being applied to real-world applications, mechanisms to address distributional shift and sequential task learning without forgetting are critical. Methods incorporating network expansion have shown promise by naturally adding model capacity for learning new tasks while simultaneously avoiding catastrophic forgetting. However, the growth in the number of additional parameters of many of these types of methods can be computationally expensive at larger scales, at times prohibitively so. Instead, we propose a simple task-specific feature map transformation strategy for continual learning, which we call Efficient Feature Transformations (EFTs). These EFTs provide powerful flexibility for learning new tasks, achieved with minimal parameters added to the base architecture. We further propose a feature distance maximization strategy, which significantly improves task prediction in class incremental settings, without needing expensive generative models. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our method with an extensive set of experiments in discriminative (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K) and generative (LSUN, CUB-200, Cats) sequences of tasks. Even with low single-digit parameter growth rates, EFTs can outperform many other continual learning methods in a wide range of settings.\n",
      "Predicting multiple plausible future trajectories of the nearby vehicles is crucial for the safety of autonomous driving. Recent motion prediction approaches attempt to achieve such multimodal motion prediction by implicitly regularizing the feature or explicitly generating multiple candidate proposals. However, it remains challenging since the latent features may concentrate on the most frequent mode of the data while the proposal-based methods depend largely on the prior knowledge to generate and select the proposals. In this work, we propose a novel transformer framework for multimodal motion prediction, termed as mmTransformer. A novel network architecture based on stacked transformers is designed to model the multimodality at feature level with a set of fixed independent proposals. A region-based training strategy is then developed to induce the multimodality of the generated proposals. Experiments on Argoverse dataset show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on motion prediction, substantially improving the diversity and the accuracy of the predicted trajectories. Demo video and code are available at https://decisionforce.github.io/mmTransformer.\n",
      "Machine learning (ML) is successful in achieving human-level performance in various fields. However, it lacks the ability to explain an outcome due to its black-box nature. While existing explainable ML is promising, almost all of these methods focus on formatting interpretability as an optimization problem. Such a mapping leads to numerous iterations of time-consuming complex computations, which limits their applicability in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for accelerating explainable ML using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). The proposed framework exploits the synergy between matrix convolution and Fourier transform, and takes full advantage of TPU's natural ability in accelerating matrix computations. Specifically, this paper makes three important contributions. (1) To the best of our knowledge, our proposed work is the first attempt in enabling hardware acceleration of explainable ML using TPUs. (2) Our proposed approach is applicable across a wide variety of ML algorithms, and effective utilization of TPU-based acceleration can lead to real-time outcome interpretation. (3) Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach can provide an order-of-magnitude speedup in both classification time (25x on average) and interpretation time (13x on average) compared to state-of-the-art techniques.\n",
      "2D Convolutional neural network (CNN) has arguably become the de facto standard for computer vision tasks. Recent findings, however, suggest that CNN may not be the best option for 1D pattern recognition, especially for datasets with over 1 M training samples, e.g., existing CNN-based methods for 1D signals are highly reliant on human pre-processing. Common practices include utilizing discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to reconstruct 1D signal into 2D array. To add to extant knowledge, in this paper, a novel 1D data processing algorithm is proposed for 1D big data analysis through learning a deep deconvolutional-convolutional network. Rather than resorting to human-based techniques, we employed deconvolution layers to convert 1 D signals into 2D data. On top of the deconvolution model, the data was identified by a 2D CNN. Compared with the existing 1D signal processing algorithms, DCNet boasts the advantages of less human-made inference and higher generalization performance. Our experimental results from a varying number of training patterns (50 K to 11 M) from classification and regression demonstrate the desirability of our new approach.\n",
      "A wide variety of deep learning techniques from style transfer to multitask learning rely on training affine transformations of features. Most prominent among these is the popular feature normalization technique BatchNorm, which normalizes activations and then subsequently applies a learned affine transform. In this paper, we aim to understand the role and expressive power of affine parameters used to transform features in this way. To isolate the contribution of these parameters from that of the learned features they transform, we investigate the performance achieved when training only these parameters in BatchNorm and freezing all weights at their random initializations. Doing so leads to surprisingly high performance considering the significant limitations that this style of training imposes. For example, sufficiently deep ResNets reach 82% (CIFAR-10) and 32% (ImageNet, top-5) accuracy in this configuration, far higher than when training an equivalent number of randomly chosen parameters elsewhere in the network. BatchNorm achieves this performance in part by naturally learning to disable around a third of the random features. Not only do these results highlight the expressive power of affine parameters in deep learning, but - in a broader sense - they characterize the expressive power of neural networks constructed simply by shifting and rescaling random features.\n",
      "To facilitate implementation of high-accuracy deep neural networks especially on resource-constrained devices, maintaining low computation requirements is crucial. Using very deep models for classification purposes not only decreases the neural network training speed and increases the inference time, but also need more data for higher prediction accuracy and to mitigate false positives.   In this paper, we propose an efficient and lightweight deep classification ensemble structure based on a combination of simple color features, which is particularly designed for \"high-accuracy\" image classifications with low false positives. We designed, implemented, and evaluated our approach for explosion detection use-case applied to images and videos. Our evaluation results based on a large test test show considerable improvements on the prediction accuracy compared to the popular ResNet-50 model, while benefiting from 7.64x faster inference and lower computation cost.   While we applied our approach to explosion detection, our approach is general and can be applied to other similar classification use cases as well. Given the insight gained from our experiments, we hence propose a \"think small, think many\" philosophy in classification scenarios: that transforming a single, large, monolithic deep model into a verification-based step model ensemble of multiple small, simple, lightweight models with narrowed-down color spaces can possibly lead to predictions with higher accuracy.\n",
      "We propose a conditional positional encoding (CPE) scheme for vision Transformers. Unlike previous fixed or learnable positional encodings, which are pre-defined and independent of input tokens, CPE is dynamically generated and conditioned on the local neighborhood of the input tokens. As a result, CPE can easily generalize to the input sequences that are longer than what the model has ever seen during training. Besides, CPE can keep the desired translation-invariance in the image classification task, resulting in improved classification accuracy. CPE can be effortlessly implemented with a simple Position Encoding Generator (PEG), and it can be seamlessly incorporated into the current Transformer framework. Built on PEG, we present Conditional Position encoding Vision Transformer (CPVT). We demonstrate that CPVT has visually similar attention maps compared to those with learned positional encodings. Benefit from the conditional positional encoding scheme, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet classification task compared with vision Transformers to date. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/Meituan-AutoML/CPVT .\n",
      "The F-measure, also known as the F1-score, is widely used to assess the performance of classification algorithms. However, some researchers find it lacking in intuitive interpretation, questioning the appropriateness of combining two aspects of performance as conceptually distinct as precision and recall, and also questioning whether the harmonic mean is the best way to combine them. To ease this concern, we describe a simple transformation of the F-measure, which we call F* (F-star), which has an immediate practical interpretation.\n",
      "Deep learning has shown impressive performance on challenging perceptual tasks and has been widely used in software to provide intelligent services. However, researchers found deep neural networks vulnerable to adversarial examples. Since then, many methods are proposed to defend against adversaries in inputs, but they are either attack-dependent or shown to be ineffective with new attacks. And most of existing techniques have complicated structures or mechanisms that cause prohibitively high overhead or latency, impractical to apply on real software.   We propose DAFAR, a feedback framework that allows deep learning models to detect/purify adversarial examples in high effectiveness and universality, with low area and time overhead. DAFAR has a simple structure, containing a victim model, a plug-in feedback network, and a detector. The key idea is to import the high-level features from the victim model's feature extraction layers into the feedback network to reconstruct the input. This data stream forms a feedback autoencoder. For strong attacks, it transforms the imperceptible attack on the victim model into the obvious reconstruction-error attack on the feedback autoencoder directly, which is much easier to detect; for weak attacks, the reformation process destroys the structure of adversarial examples. Experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 data-sets, showing that DAFAR is effective against popular and arguably most advanced attacks without losing performance on legitimate samples, with high effectiveness and universality across attack methods and parameters.\n",
      "Background and aim: Image registration and alignment are the main limitations of augmented reality-based knee replacement surgery. This research aims to decrease the registration error, eliminate outcomes that are trapped in local minima to improve the alignment problems, handle the occlusion, and maximize the overlapping parts. Methodology: markerless image registration method was used for Augmented reality-based knee replacement surgery to guide and visualize the surgical operation. While weight least square algorithm was used to enhance stereo camera-based tracking by filling border occlusion in right to left direction and non-border occlusion from left to right direction. Results: This study has improved video precision to 0.57 mm~0.61 mm alignment error. Furthermore, with the use of bidirectional points, for example, forwards and backwards directional cloud point, the iteration on image registration was decreased. This has led to improve the processing time as well. The processing time of video frames was improved to 7.4~11.74 fps. Conclusions: It seems clear that this proposed system has focused on overcoming the misalignment difficulty caused by movement of patient and enhancing the AR visualization during knee replacement surgery. The proposed system was reliable and favorable which helps in eliminating alignment error by ascertaining the optimal rigid transformation between two cloud points and removing the outliers and non-Gaussian noise. The proposed augmented reality system helps in accurate visualization and navigation of anatomy of knee such as femur, tibia, cartilage, blood vessels, etc.\n",
      "Multivariate time-series forecasting plays a crucial role in many real-world applications. It is a challenging problem as one needs to consider both intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series correlations simultaneously. Recently, there have been multiple works trying to capture both correlations, but most, if not all of them only capture temporal correlations in the time domain and resort to pre-defined priors as inter-series relationships.   In this paper, we propose Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) to further improve the accuracy of multivariate time-series forecasting. StemGNN captures inter-series correlations and temporal dependencies \\textit{jointly} in the \\textit{spectral domain}. It combines Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) which models inter-series correlations and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) which models temporal dependencies in an end-to-end framework. After passing through GFT and DFT, the spectral representations hold clear patterns and can be predicted effectively by convolution and sequential learning modules. Moreover, StemGNN learns inter-series correlations automatically from the data without using pre-defined priors. We conduct extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of StemGNN. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/StemGNN/\n",
      "AutoAugment has sparked an interest in automated augmentation methods for deep learning models. These methods estimate image transformation policies for train data that improve generalization to test data. While recent papers evolved in the direction of decreasing policy search complexity, we show that those methods are not robust when applied to biased and noisy data. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate AutoAugment as a generalized automated dataset optimization (AutoDO) task that minimizes the distribution shift between test data and distorted train dataset. In our AutoDO model, we explicitly estimate a set of per-point hyperparameters to flexibly change distribution of train data. In particular, we include hyperparameters for augmentation, loss weights, and soft-labels that are jointly estimated using implicit differentiation. We develop a theoretical probabilistic interpretation of this framework using Fisher information and show that its complexity scales linearly with the dataset size. Our experiments on SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet classification show up to 9.3% improvement for biased datasets with label noise compared to prior methods and, importantly, up to 36.6% gain for underrepresented SVHN classes.\n",
      "Deformable image registration is fundamental for many medical image analyses. A key obstacle for accurate image registration is the variations in image appearance. Recently, deep learning-based registration methods (DLRs), using deep neural networks, have computational efficiency that is several orders of magnitude greater than traditional optimization-based registration methods (ORs). A major drawback, however, of DLRs is a disregard for the target-pair-specific optimization that is inherent in ORs and instead they rely on a globally optimized network that is trained with a set of training samples to achieve faster registration. Thus, DLRs inherently have degraded ability to adapt to appearance variations and perform poorly, compared to ORs, when image pairs (fixed/moving images) have large differences in appearance. Hence, we propose an Appearance Adjustment Network (AAN) where we leverage anatomy edges, through an anatomy-constrained loss function, to generate an anatomy-preserving appearance transformation. We designed the AAN so that it can be readily inserted into a wide range of DLRs, to reduce the appearance differences between the fixed and moving images. Our AAN and DLR's network can be trained cooperatively in an unsupervised and end-to-end manner. We evaluated our AAN with two widely used DLRs - Voxelmorph (VM) and FAst IMage registration (FAIM) - on three public 3D brain magnetic resonance (MR) image datasets - IBSR18, Mindboggle101, and LPBA40. The results show that DLRs, using the AAN, improved performance and achieved higher results than state-of-the-art ORs.\n",
      "Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are considered a soft computing technique combining elements of fuzzy logic and recurrent neural networks. They found multiple application in such domains as modeling of system behavior, prediction of time series, decision making and process control. Less attention, however, has been turned towards using them in pattern classification. In this work we propose an FCM based classifier with a fully connected map structure. In contrast to methods that expect reaching a steady system state during reasoning, we chose to execute a few FCM iterations (steps) before collecting output labels. Weights were learned with a gradient algorithm and logloss or cross-entropy were used as the cost function. Our primary goal was to verify, whether such design would result in a descent general purpose classifier, with performance comparable to off the shelf classical methods. As the preliminary results were promising, we investigated the hypothesis that the performance of $d$-step classifier can be attributed to a fact that in previous $d-1$ steps it transforms the feature space by grouping observations belonging to a given class, so that they became more compact and separable. To verify this hypothesis we calculated three clustering scores for the transformed feature space. We also evaluated performance of pipelines built from FCM-based data transformer followed by a classification algorithm. The standard statistical analyzes confirmed both the performance of FCM based classifier and its capability to improve data. The supporting prototype software was implemented in Python using TensorFlow library.\n",
      "A large number of time series forecasting models including traditional statistical models, machine learning models and more recently deep learning have been proposed in the literature. However, choosing the right model along with good parameter values that performs well on a given data is still challenging. Automatically providing a good set of models to users for a given dataset saves both time and effort from using trial-and-error approaches with a wide variety of available models along with parameter optimization. We present AutoAI for Time Series Forecasting (AutoAI-TS) that provides users with a zero configuration (zero-conf ) system to efficiently train, optimize and choose best forecasting model among various classes of models for the given dataset. With its flexible zero-conf design, AutoAI-TS automatically performs all the data preparation, model creation, parameter optimization, training and model selection for users and provides a trained model that is ready to use. For given data, AutoAI-TS utilizes a wide variety of models including classical statistical models, Machine Learning (ML) models, statistical-ML hybrid models and deep learning models along with various transformations to create forecasting pipelines. It then evaluates and ranks pipelines using the proposed T-Daub mechanism to choose the best pipeline. The paper describe in detail all the technical aspects of AutoAI-TS along with extensive benchmarking on a variety of real world data sets for various use-cases. Benchmark results show that AutoAI-TS, with no manual configuration from the user, automatically trains and selects pipelines that on average outperform existing state-of-the-art time series forecasting toolkits.\n",
      "Unobserved confounding is one of the main challenges when estimating causal effects. We propose a novel causal reduction method that replaces an arbitrary number of possibly high-dimensional latent confounders with a single latent confounder that lives in the same space as the treatment variable without changing the observational and interventional distributions entailed by the causal model. After the reduction, we parameterize the reduced causal model using a flexible class of transformations, so-called normalizing flows. We propose a learning algorithm to estimate the parameterized reduced model jointly from observational and interventional data. This allows us to estimate the causal effect in a principled way from combined data. We perform a series of experiments on data simulated using nonlinear causal mechanisms and find that we can often substantially reduce the number of interventional samples when adding observational training samples without sacrificing accuracy. Thus, adding observational data may help to more accurately estimate causal effects even in the presence of unobserved confounders.\n",
      "Graph data completion is a fundamentally important issue as data generally has a graph structure, e.g., social networks, recommendation systems, and the Internet of Things. We consider a graph where each node has a data matrix, represented as a \\textit{graph-tensor} by stacking the data matrices in the third dimension. In this paper, we propose a \\textit{Convolutional Graph-Tensor Net} (\\textit{Conv GT-Net}) for the graph data completion problem, which uses deep neural networks to learn the general transform of graph-tensors. The experimental results on the ego-Facebook data sets show that the proposed \\textit{Conv GT-Net} achieves significant improvements on both completion accuracy (50\\% higher) and completion speed (3.6x $\\sim$ 8.1x faster) over the existing algorithms.\n",
      "We present the Colorization Transformer, a novel approach for diverse high fidelity image colorization based on self-attention. Given a grayscale image, the colorization proceeds in three steps. We first use a conditional autoregressive transformer to produce a low resolution coarse coloring of the grayscale image. Our architecture adopts conditional transformer layers to effectively condition grayscale input. Two subsequent fully parallel networks upsample the coarse colored low resolution image into a finely colored high resolution image. Sampling from the Colorization Transformer produces diverse colorings whose fidelity outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on colorising ImageNet based on FID results and based on a human evaluation in a Mechanical Turk test. Remarkably, in more than 60% of cases human evaluators prefer the highest rated among three generated colorings over the ground truth.

      "Many intellectual endeavors require mathematical problem solving, but this skill remains beyond the capabilities of computers. To measure this ability in machine learning models, we introduce MATH, a new dataset of 12,500 challenging competition mathematics problems. Each problem in MATH has a full step-by-step solution which can be used to teach models to generate answer derivations and explanations. To facilitate future research and increase accuracy on MATH, we also contribute a large auxiliary pretraining dataset which helps teach models the fundamentals of mathematics. Even though we are able to increase accuracy on MATH, our results show that accuracy remains relatively low, even with enormous Transformer models. Moreover, we find that simply increasing budgets and model parameter counts will be impractical for achieving strong mathematical reasoning if scaling trends continue. While scaling Transformers is automatically solving most other text-based tasks, scaling is not currently solving MATH. To have more traction on mathematical problem solving we will likely need new algorithmic advancements from the broader research community.\n",
      "In this paper we introduce OperA, a transformer-based model that accurately predicts surgical phases from long video sequences. A novel attention regularization loss encourages the model to focus on high-quality frames during training. Moreover, the attention weights are utilized to identify characteristic high attention frames for each surgical phase, which could further be used for surgery summarization. OperA is thoroughly evaluated on two datasets of laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos, outperforming various state-of-the-art temporal refinement approaches.\n",
      "Inspired by humans' remarkable ability to master arithmetic and generalize to unseen problems, we present a new dataset, HINT, to study machines' capability of learning generalizable concepts at three different levels: perception, syntax, and semantics. In particular, concepts in HINT, including both digits and operators, are required to learn in a weakly-supervised fashion: Only the final results of handwriting expressions are provided as supervision. Learning agents need to reckon how concepts are perceived from raw signals such as images (i.e., perception), how multiple concepts are structurally combined to form a valid expression (i.e., syntax), and how concepts are realized to afford various reasoning tasks (i.e., semantics). With a focus on systematic generalization, we carefully design a five-fold test set to evaluate both the interpolation and the extrapolation of learned concepts. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a neural-symbolic system by integrating neural networks with grammar parsing and program synthesis, learned by a novel deduction--abduction strategy. In experiments, the proposed neural-symbolic system demonstrates strong generalization capability and significantly outperforms end-to-end neural methods like RNN and Transformer. The results also indicate the significance of recursive priors for extrapolation on syntax and semantics.\n",
      "Deep learning has seen a movement away from representing examples with a monolithic hidden state towards a richly structured state. For example, Transformers segment by position, and object-centric architectures decompose images into entities. In all these architectures, interactions between different elements are modeled via pairwise interactions: Transformers make use of self-attention to incorporate information from other positions; object-centric architectures make use of graph neural networks to model interactions among entities. However, pairwise interactions may not achieve global coordination or a coherent, integrated representation that can be used for downstream tasks. In cognitive science, a global workspace architecture has been proposed in which functionally specialized components share information through a common, bandwidth-limited communication channel. We explore the use of such a communication channel in the context of deep learning for modeling the structure of complex environments. The proposed method includes a shared workspace through which communication among different specialist modules takes place but due to limits on the communication bandwidth, specialist modules must compete for access. We show that capacity limitations have a rational basis in that (1) they encourage specialization and compositionality and (2) they facilitate the synchronization of otherwise independent specialists.\n",
      "This paper proposes Omnidirectional Representations from Transformers (OmniNet). In OmniNet, instead of maintaining a strictly horizontal receptive field, each token is allowed to attend to all tokens in the entire network. This process can also be interpreted as a form of extreme or intensive attention mechanism that has the receptive field of the entire width and depth of the network. To this end, the omnidirectional attention is learned via a meta-learner, which is essentially another self-attention based model. In order to mitigate the computationally expensive costs of full receptive field attention, we leverage efficient self-attention models such as kernel-based (Choromanski et al.), low-rank attention (Wang et al.) and/or Big Bird (Zaheer et al.) as the meta-learner. Extensive experiments are conducted on autoregressive language modeling (LM1B, C4), Machine Translation, Long Range Arena (LRA), and Image Recognition. The experiments show that OmniNet achieves considerable improvements across these tasks, including achieving state-of-the-art performance on LM1B, WMT'14 En-De/En-Fr, and Long Range Arena. Moreover, using omnidirectional representation in Vision Transformers leads to significant improvements on image recognition tasks on both few-shot learning and fine-tuning setups.\n",
      "An important development in deep learning from the earliest MLPs has been a move towards architectures with structural inductive biases which enable the model to keep distinct sources of information and routes of processing well-separated. This structure is linked to the notion of independent mechanisms from the causality literature, in which a mechanism is able to retain the same processing as irrelevant aspects of the world are changed. For example, convnets enable separation over positions, while attention-based architectures (especially Transformers) learn which combination of positions to process dynamically. In this work we explore a way in which the Transformer architecture is deficient: it represents each position with a large monolithic hidden representation and a single set of parameters which are applied over the entire hidden representation. This potentially throws unrelated sources of information together, and limits the Transformer's ability to capture independent mechanisms. To address this, we propose Transformers with Independent Mechanisms (TIM), a new Transformer layer which divides the hidden representation and parameters into multiple mechanisms, which only exchange information through attention. Additionally, we propose a competition mechanism which encourages these mechanisms to specialize over time steps, and thus be more independent. We study TIM on a large-scale BERT model, on the Image Transformer, and on speech enhancement and find evidence for semantically meaningful specialization as well as improved performance.\n",
      "New categories can be discovered by transforming semantic features into synthesized visual features without corresponding training samples in zero-shot image classification. Although significant progress has been made in generating high-quality synthesized visual features using generative adversarial networks, guaranteeing semantic consistency between the semantic features and visual features remains very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot learning approach, GAN-CST, based on class knowledge to visual feature learning to tackle the problem. The approach consists of three parts, class knowledge overlay, semi-supervised learning and triplet loss. It applies class knowledge overlay (CKO) to obtain knowledge not only from the corresponding class but also from other classes that have the knowledge overlay. It ensures that the knowledge-to-visual learning process has adequate information to generate synthesized visual features. The approach also applies a semi-supervised learning process to re-train knowledge-to-visual model. It contributes to reinforcing synthesized visual features generation as well as new category prediction. We tabulate results on a number of benchmark datasets demonstrating that the proposed model delivers superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.\n",
      "Recent literature found that convolutional neural networks (CNN) with large filters perform well in some applications such as image semantic segmentation. Winograd transformation helps to reduce the number of multiplications in a convolution but suffers from numerical instability when the convolution filter size gets large. This work proposes a nested Winograd algorithm to iteratively decompose a large filter into a sequence of 3x3 tiles which can then be accelerated with a 3x3 Winograd algorithm. Compared with the state-of-art OLA-Winograd algorithm, the proposed algorithm reduces the multiplications by 1.41 to 3.29 times for computing 5x5 to 9x9 convolutions.\n",
      "We study the problem of adversarially robust self-supervised learning on graphs. In the contrastive learning framework, we introduce a new method that increases the adversarial robustness of the learned representations through i) adversarial transformations and ii) transformations that not only remove but also insert edges. We evaluate the learned representations in a preliminary set of experiments, obtaining promising results. We believe this work takes an important step towards incorporating robustness as a viable auxiliary task in graph contrastive learning.\n",
      "The pressure of ever-increasing patient demand and budget restrictions make hospital bed management a daily challenge for clinical staff. Most critical is the efficient allocation of resource-heavy Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds to the patients who need life support. Central to solving this problem is knowing for how long the current set of ICU patients are likely to stay in the unit. In this work, we propose a new deep learning model based on the combination of temporal convolution and pointwise (1x1) convolution, to solve the length of stay prediction task on the eICU and MIMIC-IV critical care datasets. The model - which we refer to as Temporal Pointwise Convolution (TPC) - is specifically designed to mitigate common challenges with Electronic Health Records, such as skewness, irregular sampling and missing data. In doing so, we have achieved significant performance benefits of 18-68% (metric and dataset dependent) over the commonly used Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, and the multi-head self-attention network known as the Transformer. By adding mortality prediction as a side-task, we can improve performance further still, resulting in a mean absolute deviation of 1.55 days (eICU) and 2.28 days (MIMIC-IV) on predicting remaining length of stay.\n",
      "We address the problem of uncertainty calibration and introduce a novel calibration method, Parametrized Temperature Scaling (PTS). Standard deep neural networks typically yield uncalibrated predictions, which can be transformed into calibrated confidence scores using post-hoc calibration methods. In this contribution, we demonstrate that the performance of accuracy-preserving state-of-the-art post-hoc calibrators is limited by their intrinsic expressive power. We generalize temperature scaling by computing prediction-specific temperatures, parameterized by a neural network. We show with extensive experiments that our novel accuracy-preserving approach consistently outperforms existing algorithms across a large number of model architectures, datasets and metrics.\n",
      "Analysis of longitudinal changes in imaging studies often involves both segmentation of structures of interest and registration of multiple timeframes. The accuracy of such analysis could benefit from a tailored framework that jointly optimizes both tasks to fully exploit the information available in the longitudinal data. Most learning-based registration algorithms, including joint optimization approaches, currently suffer from bias due to selection of a fixed reference frame and only support pairwise transformations. We here propose an analytical framework based on an unbiased learning strategy for group-wise registration that simultaneously registers images to the mean space of a group to obtain consistent segmentations. We evaluate the proposed method on longitudinal analysis of a white matter tract in a brain MRI dataset with 2-3 time-points for 3249 individuals, i.e., 8045 images in total. The reproducibility of the method is evaluated on test-retest data from 97 individuals. The results confirm that the implicit reference image is an average of the input image. In addition, the proposed framework leads to consistent segmentations and significantly lower processing bias than that of a pair-wise fixed-reference approach. This processing bias is even smaller than those obtained when translating segmentations by only one voxel, which can be attributed to subtle numerical instabilities and interpolation. Therefore, we postulate that the proposed mean-space learning strategy could be widely applied to learning-based registration tasks. In addition, this group-wise framework introduces a novel way for learning-based longitudinal studies by direct construction of an unbiased within-subject template and allowing reliable and efficient analysis of spatio-temporal imaging biomarkers.\n",
      "Image Captioning, or the automatic generation of descriptions for images, is one of the core problems in Computer Vision and has seen considerable progress using Deep Learning Techniques. We propose to use Inception-ResNet Convolutional Neural Network as encoder to extract features from images, Hierarchical Context based Word Embeddings for word representations and a Deep Stacked Long Short Term Memory network as decoder, in addition to using Image Data Augmentation to avoid over-fitting. For data Augmentation, we use Horizontal and Vertical Flipping in addition to Perspective Transformations on the images. We evaluate our proposed methods with two image captioning frameworks- Encoder-Decoder and Soft Attention. Evaluation on widely used metrics have shown that our approach leads to considerable improvement in model performance.\n",
      "Real-time image captioning, along with adequate precision, is the main challenge of this research field. The present work, Multiple Transformers for Self-Attention Mechanism (MTSM), utilizes multiple transformers to address these problems. The proposed algorithm, MTSM, acquires region proposals using a transformer detector (DETR). Consequently, MTSM achieves the self-attention mechanism by transferring these region proposals and their visual and geometrical features through another transformer and learns the objects' local and global interconnections. The qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed algorithm, MTSM, are shown on the MSCOCO dataset.\n",
      "The performance of $\\beta$-Variational-Autoencoders ($\\beta$-VAEs) and their variants on learning semantically meaningful, disentangled representations is unparalleled. On the other hand, there are theoretical arguments suggesting the impossibility of unsupervised disentanglement. In this work, we shed light on the inductive bias responsible for the success of VAE-based architectures. We show that in classical datasets the structure of variance, induced by the generating factors, is conveniently aligned with the latent directions fostered by the VAE objective. This builds the pivotal bias on which the disentangling abilities of VAEs rely. By small, elaborate perturbations of existing datasets, we hide the convenient correlation structure that is easily exploited by a variety of architectures. To demonstrate this, we construct modified versions of standard datasets in which (i) the generative factors are perfectly preserved; (ii) each image undergoes a mild transformation causing a small change of variance; (iii) the leading \\textbf{VAE-based disentanglement architectures fail to produce disentangled representations whilst the performance of a non-variational method remains unchanged}. The construction of our modifications is nontrivial and relies on recent progress on mechanistic understanding of $\\beta$-VAEs and their connection to PCA. We strengthen that connection by providing additional insights that are of stand-alone interest.\n",
      "Tabular datasets are ubiquitous in data science applications. Given their importance, it seems natural to apply state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms in order to fully unlock their potential. Here we propose neural network models that represent tabular time series that can optionally leverage their hierarchical structure. This results in two architectures for tabular time series: one for learning representations that is analogous to BERT and can be pre-trained end-to-end and used in downstream tasks, and one that is akin to GPT and can be used for generation of realistic synthetic tabular sequences. We demonstrate our models on two datasets: a synthetic credit card transaction dataset, where the learned representations are used for fraud detection and synthetic data generation, and on a real pollution dataset, where the learned encodings are used to predict atmospheric pollutant concentrations. Code and data are available at https://github.com/IBM/TabFormer.\n",
      "Circuit representations are becoming the lingua franca to express and reason about tractable generative and discriminative models. In this paper, we show how complex inference scenarios for these models that commonly arise in machine learning -- from computing the expectations of decision tree ensembles to information-theoretic divergences of deep mixture models -- can be represented in terms of tractable modular operations over circuits. Specifically, we characterize the tractability of a vocabulary of simple transformations -- sums, products, quotients, powers, logarithms, and exponentials -- in terms of sufficient structural constraints of the circuits they operate on, and present novel hardness results for the cases in which these properties are not satisfied. Building on these operations, we derive a unified framework for reasoning about tractable models that generalizes several results in the literature and opens up novel tractable inference scenarios.\n",
      "A core challenge in Machine Learning is to learn to disentangle natural factors of variation in data (e.g. object shape vs. pose). A popular approach to disentanglement consists in learning to map each of these factors to distinct subspaces of a model's latent representation. However, this approach has shown limited empirical success to date. Here, we show that, for a broad family of transformations acting on images--encompassing simple affine transformations such as rotations and translations--this approach to disentanglement introduces topological defects (i.e. discontinuities in the encoder). Motivated by classical results from group representation theory, we study an alternative, more flexible approach to disentanglement which relies on distributed latent operators, potentially acting on the entire latent space. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to disentangle affine transformations. Our work lays a theoretical foundation for the recent success of a new generation of models using distributed operators for disentanglement.\n",
      "This paper presents a new framework for training image-based classifiers from a combination of texts and images with very few labels. We consider a classification framework with three modules: a backbone, a relational reasoning component, and a classification component. While the backbone can be trained from unlabeled images by self-supervised learning, we can fine-tune the relational reasoning and the classification components from external sources of knowledge instead of annotated images. By proposing a transformer-based model that creates structured knowledge from textual input, we enable the utilization of the knowledge in texts. We show that, compared to the supervised baselines with 1% of the annotated images, we can achieve ~8x more accurate results in scene graph classification, ~3x in object classification, and ~1.5x in predicate classification.\n",
      "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are fragile to small perturbations in the input images. These networks are thus prone to malicious attacks that perturb the inputs to force a misclassification. Such slightly manipulated images aimed at deceiving the classifier are known as adversarial images. In this work, we investigate statistical differences between natural images and adversarial ones. More precisely, we show that employing a proper image transformation and for a class of adversarial attacks, the distribution of the leading digit of the pixels in adversarial images deviates from Benford's law. The stronger the attack, the more distant the resulting distribution is from Benford's law. Our analysis provides a detailed investigation of this new approach that can serve as a basis for alternative adversarial example detection methods that do not need to modify the original CNN classifier neither work on the raw high-dimensional pixels as features to defend against attacks.\n",
      "Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning have been largely limited in training one model from scratch for every new task. The limitation is due to the restricted model architecture related to fixed input and output dimensions. This hinders the experience accumulation and transfer of the learned agent over tasks with diverse levels of difficulty (e.g. 3 vs 3 or 5 vs 6 multi-agent games). In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore a universal multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline, designing one single architecture to fit tasks with the requirement of different observation and action configurations. Unlike previous RNN-based models, we utilize a transformer-based model to generate a flexible policy by decoupling the policy distribution from the intertwined input observation with an importance weight measured by the merits of the self-attention mechanism. Compared to a standard transformer block, the proposed model, named as Universal Policy Decoupling Transformer (UPDeT), further relaxes the action restriction and makes the multi-agent task's decision process more explainable. UPDeT is general enough to be plugged into any multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline and equip them with strong generalization abilities that enables the handling of multiple tasks at a time. Extensive experiments on large-scale SMAC multi-agent competitive games demonstrate that the proposed UPDeT-based multi-agent reinforcement learning achieves significant results relative to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating advantageous transfer capability in terms of both performance and training speed (10 times faster).\n",
      "Many deep learning based 3D face reconstruction methods have been proposed recently, however, few of them have applications in games. Current game character customization systems either require players to manually adjust considerable face attributes to obtain the desired face, or have limited freedom of facial shape and texture. In this paper, we propose an automatic character face creation method that predicts both facial shape and texture from a single portrait, and it can be integrated into most existing 3D games. Although 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) based methods can restore accurate 3D faces from single images, the topology of 3DMM mesh is different from the meshes used in most games. To acquire fidelity texture, existing methods require a large amount of face texture data for training, while building such datasets is time-consuming and laborious. Besides, such a dataset collected under laboratory conditions may not generalized well to in-the-wild situations. To tackle these problems, we propose 1) a low-cost facial texture acquisition method, 2) a shape transfer algorithm that can transform the shape of a 3DMM mesh to games, and 3) a new pipeline for training 3D game face reconstruction networks. The proposed method not only can produce detailed and vivid game characters similar to the input portrait, but can also eliminate the influence of lighting and occlusions. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods used in games.\n",
      "Message passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful modeling framework for relational data. However, the expressive power of existing GNNs is upper-bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) graph isomorphism test, which means GNNs that are not able to predict node clustering coefficients and shortest path distances, and cannot differentiate between different d-regular graphs. Here we develop a class of message passing GNNs, named Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks (ID-GNNs), with greater expressive power than the 1-WL test. ID-GNN offers a minimal but powerful solution to limitations of existing GNNs. ID-GNN extends existing GNN architectures by inductively considering nodes' identities during message passing. To embed a given node, ID-GNN first extracts the ego network centered at the node, then conducts rounds of heterogeneous message passing, where different sets of parameters are applied to the center node than to other surrounding nodes in the ego network. We further propose a simplified but faster version of ID-GNN that injects node identity information as augmented node features. Altogether, both versions of ID-GNN represent general extensions of message passing GNNs, where experiments show that transforming existing GNNs to ID-GNNs yields on average 40% accuracy improvement on challenging node, edge, and graph property prediction tasks; 3% accuracy improvement on node and graph classification benchmarks; and 15% ROC AUC improvement on real-world link prediction tasks. Additionally, ID-GNNs demonstrate improved or comparable performance over other task-specific graph networks.\n",
      "One important challenge of applying deep learning to electronic health records (EHR) is the complexity of their multimodal structure. EHR usually contains a mixture of structured (codes) and unstructured (free-text) data with sparse and irregular longitudinal features -- all of which doctors utilize when making decisions. In the deep learning regime, determining how different modality representations should be fused together is a difficult problem, which is often addressed by handcrafted modeling and intuition. In this work, we extend state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods and propose MUltimodal Fusion Architecture SeArch (MUFASA) to simultaneously search across multimodal fusion strategies and modality-specific architectures for the first time. We demonstrate empirically that our MUFASA method outperforms established unimodal NAS on public EHR data with comparable computation costs. In addition, MUFASA produces architectures that outperform Transformer and Evolved Transformer. Compared with these baselines on CCS diagnosis code prediction, our discovered models improve top-5 recall from 0.88 to 0.91 and demonstrate the ability to generalize to other EHR tasks. Studying our top architecture in depth, we provide empirical evidence that MUFASA's improvements are derived from its ability to both customize modeling for each data modality and find effective fusion strategies.\n",
      "Student dropout prediction provides an opportunity to improve student engagement, which maximizes the overall effectiveness of learning experiences. However, researches on student dropout were mainly conducted on school dropout or course dropout, and study session dropout in a mobile learning environment has not been considered thoroughly. In this paper, we investigate the study session dropout prediction problem in a mobile learning environment. First, we define the concept of the study session, study session dropout and study session dropout prediction task in a mobile learning environment. Based on the definitions, we propose a novel Transformer based model for predicting study session dropout, DAS: Deep Attentive Study Session Dropout Prediction in Mobile Learning Environment. DAS has an encoder-decoder structure which is composed of stacked multi-head attention and point-wise feed-forward networks. The deep attentive computations in DAS are capable of capturing complex relations among dynamic student interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate study session dropout in a mobile learning environment. Empirical evaluations on a large-scale dataset show that DAS achieves the best performance with a significant improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve compared to baseline models.\n",
      "Knowledge tracing, the act of modeling a student's knowledge through learning activities, is an extensively studied problem in the field of computer-aided education. Although models with attention mechanism have outperformed traditional approaches such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and collaborative filtering, they share two limitations. Firstly, the models rely on shallow attention layers and fail to capture complex relations among exercises and responses over time. Secondly, different combinations of queries, keys and values for the self-attention layer for knowledge tracing were not extensively explored. Usual practice of using exercises and interactions (exercise-response pairs) as queries and keys/values respectively lacks empirical support. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer based model for knowledge tracing, SAINT: Separated Self-AttentIve Neural Knowledge Tracing. SAINT has an encoder-decoder structure where exercise and response embedding sequence separately enter the encoder and the decoder respectively, which allows to stack attention layers multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to suggest an encoder-decoder model for knowledge tracing that applies deep self-attentive layers to exercises and responses separately. The empirical evaluations on a large-scale knowledge tracing dataset show that SAINT achieves the state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with the improvement of AUC by 1.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art models.\n",
      "Recent work has exposed the vulnerability of computer vision models to vector field attacks. Due to the widespread usage of such models in safety-critical applications, it is crucial to quantify their robustness against such spatial transformations. However, existing work only provides empirical robustness quantification against vector field deformations via adversarial attacks, which lack provable guarantees. In this work, we propose novel convex relaxations, enabling us, for the first time, to provide a certificate of robustness against vector field transformations. Our relaxations are model-agnostic and can be leveraged by a wide range of neural network verifiers. Experiments on various network architectures and different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method.\n",
      "Point clouds, being the simple and compact representation of surface geometry of 3D objects, have gained increasing popularity with the evolution of deep learning networks for classification and segmentation tasks. Unlike human, teaching the machine to analyze the segments of an object is a challenging task and quite essential in various machine vision applications. In this paper, we address the problem of segmentation and labelling of the 3D point clouds by proposing a inception based deep network architecture called PIG-Net, that effectively characterizes the local and global geometric details of the point clouds. In PIG-Net, the local features are extracted from the transformed input points using the proposed inception layers and then aligned by feature transform. These local features are aggregated using the global average pooling layer to obtain the global features. Finally, feed the concatenated local and global features to the convolution layers for segmenting the 3D point clouds. We perform an exhaustive experimental analysis of the PIG-Net architecture on two state-of-the-art datasets, namely, ShapeNet [1] and PartNet [2]. We evaluate the effectiveness of our network by performing ablation study.\n",
      "We introduce Activity Graph Transformer, an end-to-end learnable model for temporal action localization, that receives a video as input and directly predicts a set of action instances that appear in the video. Detecting and localizing action instances in untrimmed videos requires reasoning over multiple action instances in a video. The dominant paradigms in the literature process videos temporally to either propose action regions or directly produce frame-level detections. However, sequential processing of videos is problematic when the action instances have non-sequential dependencies and/or non-linear temporal ordering, such as overlapping action instances or re-occurrence of action instances over the course of the video. In this work, we capture this non-linear temporal structure by reasoning over the videos as non-sequential entities in the form of graphs. We evaluate our model on challenging datasets: THUMOS14, Charades, and EPIC-Kitchens-100. Our results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art by a considerable margin.\n",
      "Wavelet transformation stands as a cornerstone in modern data analysis and signal processing. Its mathematical essence is an invertible transformation that discerns slow patterns from fast patterns in the frequency domain, which repeats at each level. Such an invertible transformation can be learned by a designed normalizing flow model. With a factor-out scheme resembling the wavelet downsampling mechanism, a mutually independent prior, and parameter sharing along the depth of the network, one can train normalizing flow models to factor-out variables corresponding to fast patterns at different levels, thus extending linear wavelet transformations to non-linear learnable models. In this paper, a concrete way of building such flows is given. Then, a demonstration of the model's ability in lossless compression task, progressive loading, and super-resolution (upsampling) task. Lastly, an analysis of the learned model in terms of low-pass/high-pass filters is given.\n",
      "Nowadays, many of the images captured are \"observed\" by machines only and not by humans, for example, robots' or autonomous cars' cameras. High-level machine vision models, such as object recognition, assume images are transformed to some canonical image space by the camera ISP. However, the camera ISP is optimized for producing visually pleasing images to human observers and not for machines, thus, one may spare the ISP compute time and apply the vision models directly to the raw data. Yet, it has been shown that training such models directly on the RAW images results in a performance drop. To mitigate this drop in performance (without the need to annotate RAW data), we use a dataset of RAW and RGB image pairs, which can be easily acquired with no human labeling. We then train a model that is applied directly to the RAW data by using knowledge distillation such that the model predictions for RAW images will be aligned with the predictions of an off-the-shelf pre-trained model for processed RGB images. Our experiments show that our performance on RAW images is significantly better than a model trained on labeled RAW images. It also reasonably matches the predictions of a pre-trained model on processed RGB images, while saving the ISP compute overhead.\n",
      "Sensory data are often comprised of independent content and transformation factors. For example, face images may have shapes as content and poses as transformation. To infer separately these factors from given data, various ``disentangling'' models have been proposed. However, many of these are supervised or semi-supervised, either requiring attribute labels that are often unavailable or disallowing for generalization over new contents. In this study, we introduce a novel deep generative model, called group-based variational autoencoders. In this, we assume no explicit labels, but a weaker form of structure that groups together data instances having the same content but transformed differently; we thereby separately estimate a group-common factor as content and an instance-specific factor as transformation. This approach allows for learning to represent a general continuous space of contents, which can accommodate unseen contents. Despite the simplicity, our model succeeded in learning, from five datasets, content representations that are highly separate from the transformation representation and generalizable to data with novel contents. We further provide detailed analysis of the latent content code and show insight into how our model obtains the notable transformation invariance and content generalizability.\n",
      "Deep Learning (DL) is a two-step classification model that consists feature learning, generating feature representations using unsupervised ways and the supervised learning stage at the last step of model using at least two hidden layers on the proposed structures by fully connected layers depending on of the artificial neural networks. The optimization of the predefined classification parameters for the supervised models eases reaching the global optimality with exact zero training error. The autoencoder (AE) models are the highly generalized ways of the unsupervised stages for the DL to define the output weights of the hidden neurons with various representations. As alternatively to the conventional Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) AE, Hessenberg decomposition-based ELM autoencoder (HessELM-AE) is a novel kernel to generate different presentations of the input data within the intended sizes of the models. The aim of the study is analyzing the performance of the novel Deep AE kernel for clinical availability on electroencephalogram (EEG) with stroke patients. The slow cortical potentials (SCP) training in stroke patients during eight neurofeedback sessions were analyzed using Hilbert-Huang Transform. The statistical features of different frequency modulations were fed into the Deep ELM model for generative AE kernels. The novel Deep ELM-AE kernels have discriminated the brain activity with high classification performances for positivity and negativity tasks in stroke patients.\n",
      "The nuclear norm and Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm of a matrix are popular rank proxies in low-rank matrix recovery. Unfortunately, computing the nuclear norm or Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm of a tensor is NP-hard, which is a pity for low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) and tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA). In this paper, we propose a new class of rank regularizers based on the Euclidean norms of the CP component vectors of a tensor and show that these regularizers are monotonic transformations of tensor Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm. This connection enables us to minimize the Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm in LRTC and TRPCA implicitly. The methods do not use the singular value decomposition and hence scale to big tensors. Moreover, the methods are not sensitive to the choice of initial rank and provide an arbitrarily sharper rank proxy for low-rank tensor recovery compared to nuclear norm. We provide theoretical guarantees in terms of recovery error for LRTC and TRPCA, which show relatively smaller $p$ of Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm leads to tighter error bounds. Experiments using LRTC and TRPCA on synthetic data and natural images verify the effectiveness and superiority of our methods compared to baseline methods.\n",
      "While designing inductive bias in neural architectures has been widely studied, we hypothesize that transformer networks are flexible enough to learn inductive bias from suitable generic tasks. Here, we replace architecture engineering by encoding inductive bias in the form of datasets. Inspired by Peirce's view that deduction, induction, and abduction form an irreducible set of reasoning primitives, we design three synthetic tasks that are intended to require the model to have these three abilities. We specifically design these synthetic tasks in a way that they are devoid of mathematical knowledge to ensure that only the fundamental reasoning biases can be learned from these tasks. This defines a new pre-training methodology called \"LIME\" (Learning Inductive bias for Mathematical rEasoning). Models trained with LIME significantly outperform vanilla transformers on three very different large mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Unlike dominating the computation cost as traditional pre-training approaches, LIME requires only a small fraction of the computation cost of the typical downstream task.\n",
      "Time series classification (TSC) gained a lot of attention in the past decade and number of methods for representing and classifying time series have been proposed. Nowadays, methods based on convolutional networks and ensemble techniques represent the state of the art for time series classification. Techniques transforming time series to image or text also provide reliable ways to extract meaningful features or representations of time series. We compare the state-of-the-art representation and classification methods on a specific application, that is predictive maintenance from sequences of event logs. The contributions of this paper are twofold: introducing a new data set for predictive maintenance on automated teller machines (ATMs) log data and comparing the performance of different representation methods for predicting the occurrence of a breakdown. The problem is difficult since unlike the classic case of predictive maintenance via signals from sensors, we have sequences of discrete event logs occurring at any time and the lengths of the sequences, corresponding to life cycles, vary a lot.\n",
      "Despite the explosion of interest in healthcare AI research, the reproducibility and benchmarking of those research works are often limited due to the lack of standard benchmark datasets and diverse evaluation metrics. To address this reproducibility challenge, we develop PyHealth, an open-source Python toolbox for developing various predictive models on healthcare data.   PyHealth consists of data preprocessing module, predictive modeling module, and evaluation module. The target users of PyHealth are both computer science researchers and healthcare data scientists. With PyHealth, they can conduct complex machine learning pipelines on healthcare datasets with fewer than ten lines of code. The data preprocessing module enables the transformation of complex healthcare datasets such as longitudinal electronic health records, medical images, continuous signals (e.g., electrocardiogram), and clinical notes into machine learning friendly formats. The predictive modeling module provides more than 30 machine learning models, including established ensemble trees and deep neural network-based approaches, via a unified but extendable API designed for both researchers and practitioners. The evaluation module provides various evaluation strategies (e.g., cross-validation and train-validation-test split) and predictive model metrics.   With robustness and scalability in mind, best practices such as unit testing, continuous integration, code coverage, and interactive examples are introduced in the library's development. PyHealth can be installed through the Python Package Index (PyPI) or https://github.com/yzhao062/PyHealth .\n",
      "In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.\n",
      "Individual mobility is driven by demand for activities with diverse spatiotemporal patterns, but existing methods for mobility prediction often overlook the underlying activity patterns. To address this issue, this study develops an activity-based modeling framework for individual mobility prediction. Specifically, an input-output hidden Markov model (IOHMM) framework is proposed to simultaneously predict the (continuous) time and (discrete) location of an individual's next trip using transit smart card data. The prediction task can be transformed into predicting the hidden activity duration and end location. Based on a case study of Hong Kong's metro system, we show that the proposed model can achieve similar prediction performance as the state-of-the-art long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Unlike LSTM, the proposed IOHMM model can also be used to analyze hidden activity patterns, which provides meaningful behavioral interpretation for why an individual makes a certain trip. Therefore, the activity-based prediction framework offers a way to preserve the predictive power of advanced machine learning methods while enhancing our ability to generate insightful behavioral explanations, which is useful for enhancing situational awareness in user-centric transportation applications such as personalized traveler information.\n",
      "This paper proposes a method for OOD detection. Questioning the premise of previous studies that ID and OOD samples are separated distinctly, we consider samples lying in the intermediate of the two and use them for training a network. We generate such samples using multiple image transformations that corrupt inputs in various ways and with different severity levels. We estimate where the generated samples by a single image transformation lie between ID and OOD using a network trained on clean ID samples. To be specific, we make the network classify the generated samples and calculate their mean classification accuracy, using which we create a soft target label for them. We train the same network from scratch using the original ID samples and the generated samples with the soft labels created for them. We detect OOD samples by thresholding the entropy of the predicted softmax probability. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in the standard benchmark tests. We also analyze the effect of the number and particular combinations of image corrupting transformations on the performance.\n",
      "Neural networks are often over-parameterized and hence benefit from aggressive regularization. Conventional regularization methods, such as Dropout or weight decay, do not leverage the structures of the network's inputs and hidden states. As a result, these conventional methods are less effective than methods that leverage the structures, such as SpatialDropout and DropBlock, which randomly drop the values at certain contiguous areas in the hidden states and setting them to zero. Although the locations of dropout areas random, the patterns of SpatialDropout and DropBlock are manually designed and fixed. Here we propose to learn the dropout patterns. In our method, a controller learns to generate a dropout pattern at every channel and layer of a target network, such as a ConvNet or a Transformer. The target network is then trained with the dropout pattern, and its resulting validation performance is used as a signal for the controller to learn from. We show that this method works well for both image recognition on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, as well as language modeling on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. The learned dropout patterns also transfers to different tasks and datasets, such as from language model on Penn Treebank to Engligh-French translation on WMT 2014. Our code will be available.\n",
      "What is the creative process through which an artist goes from an original image to a painting? Can we examine this process using techniques from computer vision and pattern recognition? Here we set the first preliminary steps to algorithmically deconstruct some of the transformations that an artist applies to an original image in order to establish centres of interest, which are focal areas of a painting that carry meaning. We introduce a comparative methodology that first cuts out the minimal segment from the original image on which the painting is based, then aligns the painting with this source, investigates micro-differences to identify centres of interest and attempts to understand their role. In this paper we focus exclusively on micro-differences with respect to edges. We believe that research into where and how artists create centres of interest in paintings is valuable for curators, art historians, viewers, and art educators, and might even help artists to understand and refine their own artistic method.\n",
      "Thumbnail is the face of online videos. The explosive growth of videos both in number and variety underpins the importance of a good thumbnail because it saves potential viewers time to choose videos and even entice them to click on them. A good thumbnail should be a frame that best represents the content of a video while at the same time capturing viewers' attention. However, the techniques and models in the past only focus on frames within a video, and we believe such narrowed focus leave out much useful information that are part of a video. In this paper, we expand the definition of content to include title, description, and audio of a video and utilize information provided by these modalities in our selection model. Specifically, our model will first sample frames uniformly in time and return the top 1,000 frames in this subset with the highest aesthetic scores by a Double-column Convolutional Neural Network, to avoid the computational burden of processing all frames in downstream task. Then, the model incorporates frame features extracted from VGG16, text features from ELECTRA, and audio features from TRILL. These models were selected because of their results on popular datasets as well as their competitive performances. After feature extraction, the time-series features, frames and audio, will be fed into Transformer encoder layers to return a vector representing their corresponding modality. Each of the four features (frames, title, description, audios) will pass through a context gating layer before concatenation. Finally, our model will generate a vector in the latent space and select the frame that is most similar to this vector in the latent space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a multi-modal deep learning model to select video thumbnail, which beats the result from the previous State-of-The-Art models.\n",
      "Anomaly detection aims to find instances that are considered unusual and is a fundamental problem of data science. Recently, deep anomaly detection methods were shown to achieve superior results particularly in complex data such as images. Our work focuses on deep one-class classification for anomaly detection which learns a mapping only from the normal samples. However, the non-linear transformation performed by deep learning can potentially find patterns associated with social bias. The challenge with adding fairness to deep anomaly detection is to ensure both making fair and correct anomaly predictions simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for the fair anomaly detection approach (Deep Fair SVDD) and train it using an adversarial network to de-correlate the relationships between the sensitive attributes and the learned representations. This differs from how fairness is typically added namely as a regularizer or a constraint. Further, we propose two effective fairness measures and empirically demonstrate that existing deep anomaly detection methods are unfair. We show that our proposed approach can remove the unfairness largely with minimal loss on the anomaly detection performance. Lastly, we conduct an in-depth analysis to show the strength and limitations of our proposed model, including parameter analysis, feature visualization, and run-time analysis.\n",
      "This paper introduces UDIVA, a new non-acted dataset of face-to-face dyadic interactions, where interlocutors perform competitive and collaborative tasks with different behavior elicitation and cognitive workload. The dataset consists of 90.5 hours of dyadic interactions among 147 participants distributed in 188 sessions, recorded using multiple audiovisual and physiological sensors. Currently, it includes sociodemographic, self- and peer-reported personality, internal state, and relationship profiling from participants. As an initial analysis on UDIVA, we propose a transformer-based method for self-reported personality inference in dyadic scenarios, which uses audiovisual data and different sources of context from both interlocutors to regress a target person's personality traits. Preliminary results from an incremental study show consistent improvements when using all available context information.\n",
      "Due to the automatic feature extraction procedure via multi-layer nonlinear transformations, the deep learning-based visual trackers have recently achieved great success in challenging scenarios for visual tracking purposes. Although many of those trackers utilize the feature maps from pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the effects of selecting different models and exploiting various combinations of their feature maps are still not compared completely. To the best of our knowledge, all those methods use a fixed number of convolutional feature maps without considering the scene attributes (e.g., occlusion, deformation, and fast motion) that might occur during tracking. As a pre-requisition, this paper proposes adaptive discriminative correlation filters (DCF) based on the methods that can exploit CNN models with different topologies. First, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of four commonly used CNN models to determine the best feature maps of each model. Second, with the aid of analysis results as attribute dictionaries, adaptive exploitation of deep features is proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of visual trackers regarding video characteristics. Third, the generalization of the proposed method is validated on various tracking datasets as well as CNN models with similar architectures. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive method compared with state-of-the-art visual tracking methods.\n",
      "This paper introduces the Sequential Monte Carlo Transformer, an original approach that naturally captures the observations distribution in a transformer architecture. The keys, queries, values and attention vectors of the network are considered as the unobserved stochastic states of its hidden structure. This generative model is such that at each time step the received observation is a random function of its past states in a given attention window. In this general state-space setting, we use Sequential Monte Carlo methods to approximate the posterior distributions of the states given the observations, and to estimate the gradient of the log-likelihood. We hence propose a generative model giving a predictive distribution, instead of a single-point estimate.\n",
      "Recently, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test was used to measure the expressiveness of graph neural networks (GNNs), showing that the neighborhood aggregation GNNs were at most as powerful as 1-WL test in distinguishing graph structures. There were also improvements proposed in analogy to $k$-WL test ($k>1$). However, the aggregators in these GNNs are far from injective as required by the WL test, and suffer from weak distinguishing strength, making it become expressive bottlenecks. In this paper, we improve the expressiveness by exploring powerful aggregators. We reformulate aggregation with the corresponding aggregation coefficient matrix, and then systematically analyze the requirements of the aggregation coefficient matrix for building more powerful aggregators and even injective aggregators. It can also be viewed as the strategy for preserving the rank of hidden features, and implies that basic aggregators correspond to a special case of low-rank transformations. We also show the necessity of applying nonlinear units ahead of aggregation, which is different from most aggregation-based GNNs. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop two GNN layers, ExpandingConv and CombConv. Experimental results show that our models significantly boost performance, especially for large and densely connected graphs.\n",
      "We propose TabTransformer, a novel deep tabular data modeling architecture for supervised and semi-supervised learning. The TabTransformer is built upon self-attention based Transformers. The Transformer layers transform the embeddings of categorical features into robust contextual embeddings to achieve higher prediction accuracy. Through extensive experiments on fifteen publicly available datasets, we show that the TabTransformer outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods for tabular data by at least 1.0% on mean AUC, and matches the performance of tree-based ensemble models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the contextual embeddings learned from TabTransformer are highly robust against both missing and noisy data features, and provide better interpretability. Lastly, for the semi-supervised setting we develop an unsupervised pre-training procedure to learn data-driven contextual embeddings, resulting in an average 2.1% AUC lift over the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "We propose a computationally efficient $G$-invariant neural network that approximates functions invariant to the action of a given permutation subgroup $G \\leq S_n$ of the symmetric group on input data. The key element of the proposed network architecture is a new $G$-invariant transformation module, which produces a $G$-invariant latent representation of the input data. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness and strong generalization properties of the proposed method in comparison to other $G$-invariant neural networks.\n",
      "Human population are striving against energy-related issues that not only affects society and the development of the world, but also causes global warming. A variety of broad approaches have been developed by both industry and the research community. However, there is an ever increasing need for comprehensive, end-to-end solutions aimed at transforming human behavior rather than device metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, a micro-moment-based smart plug system is proposed as part of a larger multi-appliance energy efficiency program. The smart plug, which includes two sub-units: the power consumption unit and environmental monitoring unit collect energy consumption of appliances along with contextual information, such as temperature, humidity, luminosity and room occupancy respectively. The plug also allows home automation capability. With the accompanying mobile application, end-users can visualize energy consumption data along with ambient environmental information. Current implementation results show that the proposed system delivers cost-effective deployment while maintaining adequate computation and wireless performance.\n",
      "KNN classification is a query triggered yet improvisational learning mode, in which they are carried out only when a test data is predicted that set a suitable K value and search the K nearest neighbors from the whole training sample space, referred them to the lazy part of KNN classification. This lazy part has been the bottleneck problem of applying KNN classification. In this paper, a one-step computation is proposed to replace the lazy part of KNN classification. The one-step computation actually transforms the lazy part to a matrix computation as follows. Given a test data, training samples are first applied to fit the test data with the least squares loss function. And then, a relationship matrix is generated by weighting all training samples according to their influence on the test data. Finally, a group lasso is employed to perform sparse learning of the relationship matrix. In this way, setting K value and searching K nearest neighbors are both integrated to a unified computation. In addition, a new classification rule is proposed for improving the performance of one-step KNN classification. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated, and demonstrated that the one-step KNN classification is efficient and promising.\n",
      "Stock portfolio optimization is the process of constant re-distribution of money to a pool of various stocks. In this paper, we will formulate the problem such that we can apply Reinforcement Learning for the task properly. To maintain a realistic assumption about the market, we will incorporate transaction cost and risk factor into the state as well. On top of that, we will apply various state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for comparison. Since the action space is continuous, the realistic formulation were tested under a family of state-of-the-art continuous policy gradients algorithms: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Generalized Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), where the former two perform much better than the last one. Next, we will present the end-to-end solution for the task with Minimum Variance Portfolio Theory for stock subset selection, and Wavelet Transform for extracting multi-frequency data pattern. Observations and hypothesis were discussed about the results, as well as possible future research directions.1\n",

      "Massive biometric deployments are pervasive in today's world. But despite the high accuracy of biometric systems, their computational efficiency degrades drastically with an increase in the database size. Thus, it is essential to index them. An ideal indexing scheme needs to generate codes that preserve the intra-subject similarity as well as inter-subject dissimilarity. Here, in this paper, we propose an iris indexing scheme using real-valued deep iris features binarized to iris bar codes (IBC) compatible with the indexing structure. Firstly, for extracting robust iris features, we have designed a network utilizing the domain knowledge of ordinal filtering and learning their nonlinear combinations. Later these real-valued features are binarized. Finally, for indexing the iris dataset, we have proposed a loss that can transform the binary feature into an improved feature compatible with the Multi-Index Hashing scheme. This loss function ensures the hamming distance equally distributed among all the contiguous disjoint sub-strings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the iris indexing domain that presents an end-to-end iris indexing structure. Experimental results on four datasets are presented to depict the efficacy of the proposed approach.\n",
      "Recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have largely focused on improving the performance of agents with the aim of replacing humans in known and well-defined environments. The use of these techniques as a game design tool for video game production, where the aim is instead to create Non-Player Character (NPC) behaviors, has received relatively little attention until recently. Turn-based strategy games like Roguelikes, for example, present unique challenges to DRL. In particular, the categorical nature of their complex game state, composed of many entities with different attributes, requires agents able to learn how to compare and prioritize these entities. Moreover, this complexity often leads to agents that overfit to states seen during training and that are unable to generalize in the face of design changes made during development. In this paper we propose two network architectures which, when combined with a \\emph{procedural loot generation} system, are able to better handle complex categorical state spaces and to mitigate the need for retraining forced by design decisions. The first is based on a dense embedding of the categorical input space that abstracts the discrete observation model and renders trained agents more able to generalize. The second proposed architecture is more general and is based on a Transformer network able to reason relationally about input and input attributes. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that new agents have better adaptation capacity with respect to a baseline architecture, making this framework more robust to dynamic gameplay changes during development. Based on the results shown in this paper, we believe that these solutions represent a step forward towards making DRL more accessible to the gaming industry.\n",
      "We propose to apply a 2D CNN architecture to 3D MRI image Alzheimer's disease classification. Training a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) is time-consuming and computationally expensive. We make use of approximate rank pooling to transform the 3D MRI image volume into a 2D image to use as input to a 2D CNN. We show our proposed CNN model achieves $9.5\\%$ better Alzheimer's disease classification accuracy than the baseline 3D models. We also show that our method allows for efficient training, requiring only 20% of the training time compared to 3D CNN models.

      "Lane detection, the process of identifying lane markings as approximated curves, is widely used for lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control in autonomous vehicles. The popular pipeline that solves it in two steps -- feature extraction plus post-processing, while useful, is too inefficient and flawed in learning the global context and lanes' long and thin structures. To tackle these issues, we propose an end-to-end method that directly outputs parameters of a lane shape model, using a network built with a transformer to learn richer structures and context. The lane shape model is formulated based on road structures and camera pose, providing physical interpretation for parameters of network output. The transformer models non-local interactions with a self-attention mechanism to capture slender structures and global context. The proposed method is validated on the TuSimple benchmark and shows state-of-the-art accuracy with the most lightweight model size and fastest speed. Additionally, our method shows excellent adaptability to a challenging self-collected lane detection dataset, showing its powerful deployment potential in real applications.

      "Multi-label image classification is the task of predicting a set of labels corresponding to objects, attributes or other entities present in an image. In this work we propose the Classification Transformer (C-Tran), a general framework for multi-label image classification that leverages Transformers to exploit the complex dependencies among visual features and labels. Our approach consists of a Transformer encoder trained to predict a set of target labels given an input set of masked labels, and visual features from a convolutional neural network. A key ingredient of our method is a label mask training objective that uses a ternary encoding scheme to represent the state of the labels as positive, negative, or unknown during training. Our model shows state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets such as COCO and Visual Genome. Moreover, because our model explicitly represents the uncertainty of labels during training, it is more general by allowing us to produce improved results for images with partial or extra label annotations during inference. We demonstrate this additional capability in the COCO, Visual Genome, News500, and CUB image datasets.\n",
      "Self-supervised learning and data augmentation have significantly reduced the performance gap between state and image-based reinforcement learning agents in continuous control tasks. However, it is still unclear whether current techniques can face a variety of visual conditions required by real-world environments. We propose a challenging benchmark that tests agents' visual generalization by adding graphical variety to existing continuous control domains. Our empirical analysis shows that current methods struggle to generalize across a diverse set of visual changes, and we examine the specific factors of variation that make these tasks difficult. We find that data augmentation techniques outperform self-supervised learning approaches and that more significant image transformations provide better visual generalization \\footnote{The benchmark and our augmented actor-critic implementation are open-sourced @ https://github.com/QData/dmc_remastered)\n",
      "Designing a multi-layer optical system with designated optical characteristics is an inverse design problem in which the resulting design is determined by several discrete and continuous parameters. In particular, we consider three design parameters to describe a multi-layer stack: Each layer's dielectric material and thickness as well as the total number of layers. Such a combination of both, discrete and continuous parameters is a challenging optimization problem that often requires a computationally expensive search for an optimal system design. Hence, most methods merely determine the optimal thicknesses of the system's layers. To incorporate layer material and the total number of layers as well, we propose a method that considers the stacking of consecutive layers as parameterized actions in a Markov decision process. We propose an exponentially transformed reward signal that eases policy optimization and adapt a recent variant of Q-learning for inverse design optimization. We demonstrate that our method outperforms human experts and a naive reinforcement learning algorithm concerning the achieved optical characteristics. Moreover, the learned Q-values contain information about the optical properties of multi-layer optical systems, thereby allowing physical interpretation or what-if analysis.\n",
      "The rapid development of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires industrial production towards digitalization to improve network efficiency. Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new paradigm Digital Twin Networks (DTN) to build network topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem into a deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present Asynchronous Actor-Critic (AAC) algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation offloading policy. Illustrative results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to significantly outperforms the benchmarks.\n",
      "Humans understand a set of canonical geometric transformations (such as translation and rotation) that support generalization by being untethered to any specific object. We explore inductive biases that help a neural network model learn these transformations in pixel space in a way that can generalize out-of-domain. Specifically, we find that high training set diversity is sufficient for the extrapolation of translation to unseen shapes and scales, and that an iterative training scheme achieves significant extrapolation of rotation in time.\n",
      "Aiming at drastic speedup for point-feature embeddings at test time, we propose a new framework that uses a pair of multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and a lookup table (LUT) to transform point-coordinate inputs into high-dimensional features. When compared with PointNet's feature embedding part realized by MLP that requires millions of dot products, the proposed framework at test time requires no such layers of matrix-vector products but requires only looking up the nearest entities from the tabulated MLP followed by interpolation, defined over discrete inputs on a 3D lattice that is substantially arranged irregularly. We call this framework LUTI-MLP: LUT Interpolation ML that provides a way to train end-to-end irregularly tabulated MLP coupled to a LUT in a specific manner without the need for any approximation at test time. LUTI-MLP also provides significant speedup for Jacobian computation of the embedding function wrt global pose coordinate on Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{se}(3)$ at test time, which could be used for point-set registration problems. After extensive evaluation using the ModelNet40, we confirmed that the LUTI-MLP even with a small (e.g., $4^3$) lattice yields performance comparable to that of the MLP while achieving significant speedup: $100\\times$ for the embedding, $12\\times$ for the approximate Jacobian, and $860\\times$ for the canonical Jacobian.\n",
      "Nowadays we are witnessing a transformation of the business processes towards a more computation driven approach. The ever increasing usage of Machine Learning techniques is the clearest example of such trend.   This sort of revolution is often providing advantages, such as an increase in prediction accuracy and a reduced time to obtain the results. However, these methods present a major drawback: it is very difficult to understand on what grounds the algorithm took the decision.   To address this issue we consider the LIME method. We give a general background on LIME then, we focus on the stability issue: employing the method repeated times, under the same conditions, may yield to different explanations.   Two complementary indices are proposed, to measure LIME stability. It is important for the practitioner to be aware of the issue, as well as to have a tool for spotting it. Stability guarantees LIME explanations to be reliable, therefore a stability assessment, made through the proposed indices, is crucial.   As a case study, we apply both Machine Learning and classical statistical techniques to Credit Risk data. We test LIME on the Machine Learning algorithm and check its stability. Eventually, we examine the goodness of the explanations returned.\n",
      "Deep convolutional networks (convnets) show a remarkable ability to learn disentangled representations. In recent years, the generalization of deep learning to Lie groups beyond rigid motion in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has allowed to build convnets over datasets with non-trivial symmetries, such as patterns over the surface of a sphere. However, one limitation of this approach is the need to explicitly define the Lie group underlying the desired invariance property before training the convnet. Whereas rotations on the sphere have a well-known symmetry group ($\\mathrm{SO}(3)$), the same cannot be said of many real-world factors of variability. For example, the disentanglement of pitch, intensity dynamics, and playing technique remains a challenging task in music information retrieval.   This article proposes a machine learning method to discover a nonlinear transformation of the space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ which maps a collection of $n$-dimensional vectors $(\\boldsymbol{x}_i)_i$ onto a collection of target vectors $(\\boldsymbol{y}_i)_i$. The key idea is to approximate every target $\\boldsymbol{y}_i$ by a matrix--vector product of the form $\\boldsymbol{\\widetilde{y}}_i = \\boldsymbol{\\phi}(t_i) \\boldsymbol{x}_i$, where the matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(t_i)$ belongs to a one-parameter subgroup of $\\mathrm{GL}_n (\\mathbb{R})$. Crucially, the value of the parameter $t_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ may change between data pairs $(\\boldsymbol{x}_i, \\boldsymbol{y}_i)$ and does not need to be known in advance.\n",
      "Transformers do not scale very well to long sequence lengths largely because of quadratic self-attention complexity. In the recent months, a wide spectrum of efficient, fast Transformers have been proposed to tackle this problem, more often than not claiming superior or comparable model quality to vanilla Transformer models. To this date, there is no well-established consensus on how to evaluate this class of models. Moreover, inconsistent benchmarking on a wide spectrum of tasks and datasets makes it difficult to assess relative model quality amongst many models. This paper proposes a systematic and unified benchmark, LRA, specifically focused on evaluating model quality under long-context scenarios. Our benchmark is a suite of tasks consisting of sequences ranging from $1K$ to $16K$ tokens, encompassing a wide range of data types and modalities such as text, natural, synthetic images, and mathematical expressions requiring similarity, structural, and visual-spatial reasoning. We systematically evaluate ten well-established long-range Transformer models (Reformers, Linformers, Linear Transformers, Sinkhorn Transformers, Performers, Synthesizers, Sparse Transformers, and Longformers) on our newly proposed benchmark suite. LRA paves the way towards better understanding this class of efficient Transformer models, facilitates more research in this direction, and presents new challenging tasks to tackle. Our benchmark code will be released at https://github.com/google-research/long-range-arena.\n",
      "Reward shaping is an effective technique for incorporating domain knowledge into reinforcement learning (RL). Existing approaches such as potential-based reward shaping normally make full use of a given shaping reward function. However, since the transformation of human knowledge into numeric reward values is often imperfect due to reasons such as human cognitive bias, completely utilizing the shaping reward function may fail to improve the performance of RL algorithms. In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptively utilizing a given shaping reward function. We formulate the utilization of shaping rewards as a bi-level optimization problem, where the lower level is to optimize policy using the shaping rewards and the upper level is to optimize a parameterized shaping weight function for true reward maximization. We formally derive the gradient of the expected true reward with respect to the shaping weight function parameters and accordingly propose three learning algorithms based on different assumptions. Experiments in sparse-reward cartpole and MuJoCo environments show that our algorithms can fully exploit beneficial shaping rewards, and meanwhile ignore unbeneficial shaping rewards or even transform them into beneficial ones.\n",
      "We present an invert-and-edit framework to automatically transform facial weight of an input face image to look thinner or heavier by leveraging semantic facial attributes encoded in the latent space of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Using a pre-trained StyleGAN as the underlying generator, we first employ an optimization-based embedding method to invert the input image into the StyleGAN latent space. Then, we identify the facial-weight attribute direction in the latent space via supervised learning and edit the inverted latent code by moving it positively or negatively along the extracted feature axis. Our framework is empirically shown to produce high-quality and realistic facial-weight transformations without requiring training GANs with a large amount of labeled face images from scratch. Ultimately, our framework can be utilized as part of an intervention to motivate individuals to make healthier food choices by visualizing the future impacts of their behavior on appearance.\n",
      "We show that ResNets converge, in the infinite depth limit, to a generalization of image registration algorithms. In this generalization, images are replaced by abstractions (ideas) living in high dimensional RKHS spaces, and material points are replaced by data points. Whereas computational anatomy aligns images via deformations of the material space, this generalization aligns ideas by via transformations of their RKHS. This identification of ResNets as idea registration algorithms has several remarkable consequences. The search for good architectures can be reduced to that of good kernels, and we show that the composition of idea registration blocks with reduced equivariant multi-channel kernels (introduced here) recovers and generalizes CNNs to arbitrary spaces and groups of transformations. Minimizers of $L_2$ regularized ResNets satisfy a discrete least action principle implying the near preservation of the norm of weights and biases across layers. The parameters of trained ResNets can be identified as solutions of an autonomous Hamiltonian system defined by the activation function and the architecture of the ANN. Momenta variables provide a sparse representation of the parameters of a ResNet. The registration regularization strategy provides a provably robust alternative to Dropout for ANNs. Pointwise RKHS error estimates lead to deterministic error estimates for ANNs.\n",
      "Inspired by recent trends in vision and language learning, we explore applications of attention mechanisms for visio-lingual fusion within an application to story-based video understanding. Like other video-based QA tasks, video story understanding requires agents to grasp complex temporal dependencies. However, as it focuses on the narrative aspect of video it also requires understanding of the interactions between different characters, as well as their actions and their motivations. We propose a novel co-attentional transformer model to better capture long-term dependencies seen in visual stories such as dramas and measure its performance on the video question answering task. We evaluate our approach on the recently introduced DramaQA dataset which features character-centered video story understanding questions. Our model outperforms the baseline model by 8 percentage points overall, at least 4.95 and up to 12.8 percentage points on all difficulty levels and manages to beat the winner of the DramaQA challenge.\n",
      "Generating a novel and optimized molecule with desired chemical properties is an essential part of the drug discovery process. Failure to meet one of the required properties can frequently lead to failure in a clinical test which is costly. In addition, optimizing these multiple properties is a challenging task because the optimization of one property is prone to changing other properties. In this paper, we pose this multi-property optimization problem as a sequence translation process and propose a new optimized molecule generator model based on the Transformer with two constraint networks: property prediction and similarity prediction. We further improve the model by incorporating score predictions from these constraint networks in a modified beam search algorithm. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin for optimizing multiple properties simultaneously.\n",
      "Few-shot learning allows machines to classify novel classes using only a few labeled samples. Recently, few-shot segmentation aiming at semantic segmentation on low sample data has also seen great interest. In this paper, we propose a learnable module for few-shot segmentation, the task-adaptive feature transformer (TAFT). TAFT linearly transforms task-specific high-level features to a set of task-agnostic features well-suited to the segmentation job. Using this task-conditioned feature transformation, the model is shown to effectively utilize the semantic information in novel classes to generate tight segmentation masks. The proposed TAFT module can be easily plugged into existing semantic segmentation algorithms to achieve few-shot segmentation capability with only a few added parameters. We combine TAFT with Deeplab V3+, a well-known segmentation architecture; experiments on the PASCAL-$5^i$ dataset confirm that this combination successfully adds few-shot learning capability to the segmentation algorithm, achieving the state-of-the-art few-shot segmentation performance in some key representative cases.\n",
      "Data augmentation has been actively studied for robust neural networks. Most of the recent data augmentation methods focus on augmenting datasets during the training phase. At the testing phase, simple transformations are still widely used for test-time augmentation. This paper proposes a novel instance-level test-time augmentation that efficiently selects suitable transformations for a test input. Our proposed method involves an auxiliary module to predict the loss of each possible transformation given the input. Then, the transformations having lower predicted losses are applied to the input. The network obtains the results by averaging the prediction results of augmented inputs. Experimental results on several image classification benchmarks show that the proposed instance-aware test-time augmentation improves the model's robustness against various corruptions.\n",
      "Testing two potentially multivariate variables for statistical dependence on the basis finite samples is a fundamental statistical challenge. Here we explore a family of tests that adapt to the complexity of the relationship between the variables, promising robust power across scenarios. Building on the distance correlation, we introduce a family of adaptive independence criteria based on nonlinear monotonic transformations of distances. We show that these criteria, like the distance correlation and RKHS-based criteria, provide dependence indicators. We propose a class of adaptive (multi-threshold) test statistics, which form the basis for permutation tests. These tests empirically outperform some of the established tests in average and worst-case statistical sensitivity across a range of univariate and multivariate relationships, offer useful insights to the data and may deserve further exploration.\n",
      "We are interested in understanding how well Transformer language models (TLMs) can perform reasoning tasks when trained on knowledge encoded in the form of natural language. We investigate their systematic generalization abilities on a logical reasoning task in natural language, which involves reasoning over relationships between entities grounded in first-order logical proofs. Specifically, we perform soft theorem-proving by leveraging TLMs to generate natural language proofs. We test the generated proofs for logical consistency, along with the accuracy of the final inference. We observe length-generalization issues when evaluated on longer-than-trained sequences. However, we observe TLMs improve their generalization performance after being exposed to longer, exhaustive proofs. In addition, we discover that TLMs are able to generalize better using backward-chaining proofs compared to their forward-chaining counterparts, while they find it easier to generate forward chaining proofs. We observe that models that are not trained to generate proofs are better at generalizing to problems based on longer proofs. This suggests that Transformers have efficient internal reasoning strategies that are harder to interpret. These results highlight the systematic generalization behavior of TLMs in the context of logical reasoning, and we believe this work motivates deeper inspection of their underlying reasoning strategies.\n",
      "Relevance has significant impact on user experience and business profit for e-commerce search platform. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for search relevance prediction, by distilling knowledge from BERT and related multi-layer Transformer teacher models into simple feed-forward networks with large amount of unlabeled data. The distillation process produces a student model that recovers more than 97\\% test accuracy of teacher models on new queries, at a serving cost that's several magnitude lower (latency 150x lower than BERT-Base and 15x lower than the most efficient BERT variant, TinyBERT). The applications of temperature rescaling and teacher model stacking further boost model accuracy, without increasing the student model complexity.   We present experimental results on both in-house e-commerce search relevance data as well as a public data set on sentiment analysis from the GLUE benchmark. The latter takes advantage of another related public data set of much larger scale, while disregarding its potentially noisy labels. Embedding analysis and case study on the in-house data further highlight the strength of the resulting model. By making the data processing and model training source code public, we hope the techniques presented here can help reduce energy consumption of the state of the art Transformer models and also level the playing field for small organizations lacking access to cutting edge machine learning hardwares.\n",
      "It is a common assumption that the activation of different layers in neural networks follow Gaussian distribution. This distribution can be transformed using normalization techniques, such as batch-normalization, increasing convergence speed and improving accuracy. In this paper we would like to demonstrate, that activations do not necessarily follow Gaussian distribution in all layers. Neurons in deeper layers are more selective and specific which can result extremely large, out-of-distribution activations.   We will demonstrate that one can create more consistent mean and variance values for batch normalization during training by filtering out these activations which can further improve convergence speed and yield higher validation accuracy.\n",
      "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an emerging methodology that is transforming the way many complicated transportation decision-making problems are tackled. Researchers have been increasingly turning to this powerful learning-based methodology to solve challenging problems across transportation fields. While many promising applications have been reported in the literature, there remains a lack of comprehensive synthesis of the many DRL algorithms and their uses and adaptations. The objective of this paper is to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive, synthesized review of DRL applications in transportation. We start by offering an overview of the DRL mathematical background, popular and promising DRL algorithms, and some highly effective DRL extensions. Building on this overview, a systematic investigation of about 150 DRL studies that have appeared in the transportation literature, divided into seven different categories, is performed. Building on this review, we continue to examine the applicability, strengths, shortcomings, and common and application-specific issues of DRL techniques with regard to their applications in transportation. In the end, we recommend directions for future research and present available resources for actually implementing DRL.\n",
      "Feature distillation is an effective way to improve the performance for a smaller student model, which has fewer parameters and lower computation cost compared to the larger teacher model. Unfortunately, there is a common obstacle - the gap in semantic feature structure between the intermediate features of teacher and student. The classic scheme prefers to transform intermediate features by adding the adaptation module, such as naive convolutional, attention-based or more complicated one. However, this introduces two problems: a) The adaptation module brings more parameters into training. b) The adaptation module with random initialization or special transformation isn't friendly for distilling a pre-trained student. In this paper, we present Matching Guided Distillation (MGD) as an efficient and parameter-free manner to solve these problems. The key idea of MGD is to pose matching the teacher channels with students' as an assignment problem. We compare three solutions of the assignment problem to reduce channels from teacher features with partial distillation loss. The overall training takes a coordinate-descent approach between two optimization objects - assignments update and parameters update. Since MGD only contains normalization or pooling operations with negligible computation cost, it is flexible to plug into network with other distillation methods.\n",
      "In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative adversarial network that creates dense 3D point clouds, with color, for assorted classes of objects in an unsupervised manner. To overcome the difficulty of capturing intricate details at high resolutions, we propose a point transformer that progressively grows the network through the use of graph convolutions. The network is composed of a leaf output layer and an initial set of branches. Every training iteration evolves a point vector into a point cloud of increasing resolution. After a fixed number of iterations, the number of branches is increased by replicating the last branch. Experimental results show that our network is capable of learning and mimicking a 3D data distribution, and produces colored point clouds with fine details at multiple resolutions.\n",
      "We introduce a data management problem called metadata debt, to identify the mapping between data concepts and their logical representations. We describe how this mapping can be learned using semisupervised topic models based on low-rank matrix factorizations that account for missing and noisy labels, coupled with sparsity penalties to improve localization and interpretability. We introduce a gauge transformation approach that allows us to construct explicit associations between topics and concept labels, and thus assign meaning to topics. We also show how to use this topic model for semisupervised learning tasks like extrapolating from known labels, evaluating possible errors in existing labels, and predicting missing features. We show results from this topic model in predicting subject tags on over 25,000 datasets from Kaggle.com, demonstrating the ability to learn semantically meaningful features.\n",
      "Post-processing immunity is a fundamental property of differential privacy: it enables the application of arbitrary data-independent transformations to the results of differentially private outputs without affecting their privacy guarantees. When query outputs must satisfy domain constraints, post-processing can be used to project the privacy-preserving outputs onto the feasible region. Moreover, when the feasible region is convex, a widely adopted class of post-processing steps is also guaranteed to improve accuracy. Post-processing has been applied successfully in many applications including census data-release, energy systems, and mobility. However, its effects on the noise distribution is poorly understood: It is often argued that post-processing may introduce bias and increase variance. This paper takes a first step towards understanding the properties of post-processing. It considers the release of census data and examines, both theoretically and empirically, the behavior of a widely adopted class of post-processing functions.\n",
      "The number of parameters in state of the art neural networks has drastically increased in recent years. This surge of interest in large scale neural networks has motivated the development of new distributed training strategies enabling such models. One such strategy is model-parallel distributed training. Unfortunately, model-parallelism suffers from poor resource utilisation, which leads to wasted resources. In this work, we improve upon recent developments in an idealised model-parallel optimisation setting: local learning. Motivated by poor resource utilisation, we introduce a class of intermediary strategies between local and global learning referred to as interlocking backpropagation. These strategies preserve many of the compute-efficiency advantages of local optimisation, while recovering much of the task performance achieved by global optimisation. We assess our strategies on both image classification ResNets and Transformer language models, finding that our strategy consistently out-performs local learning in terms of task performance, and out-performs global learning in training efficiency.\n",
      "This paper aims to provide a thorough study on the effectiveness of the transformation-based ensemble defence for image classification and its reasons. It has been empirically shown that they can enhance the robustness against evasion attacks, while there is little analysis on the reasons. In particular, it is not clear whether the robustness improvement is a result of transformation or ensemble. In this paper, we design two adaptive attacks to better evaluate the transformation-based ensemble defence. We conduct experiments to show that 1) the transferability of adversarial examples exists among the models trained on data records after different reversible transformations; 2) the robustness gained through transformation-based ensemble is limited; 3) this limited robustness is mainly from the irreversible transformations rather than the ensemble of a number of models; and 4) blindly increasing the number of sub-models in a transformation-based ensemble does not bring extra robustness gain.\n",
      "An important aspect of intelligence is the ability to adapt to a novel task without any direct experience (zero-shot), based on its relationship to previous tasks. Humans can exhibit this cognitive flexibility. By contrast, models that achieve superhuman performance in specific tasks often fail to adapt to even slight task alterations. To address this, we propose a general computational framework for adapting to novel tasks based on their relationship to prior tasks. We begin by learning vector representations of tasks. To adapt to new tasks, we propose meta-mappings, higher-order tasks that transform basic task representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework across a wide variety of tasks and computational paradigms, ranging from regression to image classification and reinforcement learning. We compare to both human adaptability and language-based approaches to zero-shot learning. Across these domains, meta-mapping is successful, often achieving 80-90% performance, without any data, on a novel task, even when the new task directly contradicts prior experience. We further show that meta-mapping can not only generalize to new tasks via learned relationships, but can also generalize using novel relationships unseen during training. Finally, using meta-mapping as a starting point can dramatically accelerate later learning on a new task, and reduce learning time and cumulative error substantially. Our results provide insight into a possible computational basis of intelligent adaptability and offer a possible framework for modeling cognitive flexibility and building more flexible artificial intelligence systems.\n",
      "Discovering concepts (or temporal abstractions) in an unsupervised manner from demonstration data in the absence of an environment is an important problem. Organizing these discovered concepts hierarchically at different levels of abstraction is useful in discovering patterns, building ontologies, and generating tutorials from demonstration data. However, recent work to discover such concepts without access to any environment does not discover relationships (or a hierarchy) between these discovered concepts. In this paper, we present a Transformer-based concept abstraction architecture UNHCLE (pronounced uncle) that extracts a hierarchy of concepts in an unsupervised way from demonstration data. We empirically demonstrate how UNHCLE discovers meaningful hierarchies using datasets from Chess and Cooking domains. Finally, we show how UNHCLE learns meaningful language labels for concepts by using demonstration data augmented with natural language for cooking and chess. All of our code is available at https://github.com/UNHCLE/UNHCLE\n",
      "The use of deep learning has grown at an exponential rate, giving rise to numerous specialized hardware and software systems for deep learning. Because the design space of deep learning software stacks and hardware accelerators is diverse and vast, prior work considers software optimizations separately from hardware architectures, effectively reducing the search space. Unfortunately, this bifurcated approach means that many profitable design points are never explored. This paper instead casts the problem as hardware/software co-design, with the goal of automatically identifying desirable points in the joint design space. The key to our solution is a new constrained Bayesian optimization framework that avoids invalid solutions by exploiting the highly constrained features of this design space, which are semi-continuous/semi-discrete. We evaluate our optimization framework by applying it to a variety of neural models, improving the energy-delay product by 18% (ResNet) and 40% (DQN) over hand-tuned state-of-the-art systems, as well as demonstrating strong results on other neural network architectures, such as MLPs and Transformers.\n",
      "Task-agnostic forms of data augmentation have proven widely effective in computer vision, even on pretrained models. In NLP similar results are reported most commonly for low data regimes, non-pretrained models, or situationally for pretrained models. In this paper we ask how effective these techniques really are when applied to pretrained transformers. Using two popular varieties of task-agnostic data augmentation (not tailored to any particular task), Easy Data Augmentation (Wei and Zou, 2019) and Back-Translation (Sennrichet al., 2015), we conduct a systematic examination of their effects across 5 classification tasks, 6 datasets, and 3 variants of modern pretrained transformers, including BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa. We observe a negative result, finding that techniques which previously reported strong improvements for non-pretrained models fail to consistently improve performance for pretrained transformers, even when training data is limited. We hope this empirical analysis helps inform practitioners where data augmentation techniques may confer improvements.\n",
      "Having the right inductive biases can be crucial in many tasks or scenarios where data or computing resources are a limiting factor, or where training data is not perfectly representative of the conditions at test time. However, defining, designing and efficiently adapting inductive biases is not necessarily straightforward. In this paper, we explore the power of knowledge distillation for transferring the effect of inductive biases from one model to another. We consider families of models with different inductive biases, LSTMs vs. Transformers and CNNs vs. MLPs, in the context of tasks and scenarios where having the right inductive biases is critical. We study the effect of inductive biases on the solutions the models converge to and investigate how and to what extent the effect of inductive biases is transferred through knowledge distillation, in terms of not only performance but also different aspects of converged solutions.\n",
      "Image animation consists of generating a video sequence so that an object in a source image is animated according to the motion of a driving video. Our framework addresses this problem without using any annotation or prior information about the specific object to animate. Once trained on a set of videos depicting objects of the same category (e.g. faces, human bodies), our method can be applied to any object of this class. To achieve this, we decouple appearance and motion information using a self-supervised formulation. To support complex motions, we use a representation consisting of a set of learned keypoints along with their local affine transformations. A generator network models occlusions arising during target motions and combines the appearance extracted from the source image and the motion derived from the driving video. Our framework scores best on diverse benchmarks and on a variety of object categories. Our source code is publicly available.\n",
      "We introduce an unsupervised graph embedding that trades off local node similarity and connectivity, and global structure. The embedding is based on a generalized graph Laplacian, whose eigenvectors compactly capture both network structure and neighborhood proximity in a single representation. The key idea is to transform the given graph into one whose weights measure the centrality of an edge by the fraction of the number of shortest paths that pass through that edge, and employ its spectral proprieties in the representation. Testing the resulting graph network representation shows significant improvement over the sate of the art in data analysis tasks including social networks and material science. We also test our method on node classification from the human-SARS CoV-2 protein-protein interactome.\n",
      "We present a simple method to reconstruct a high-resolution video from a face-video, where the identity of a person is obscured by pixelization. This concealment method is popular because the viewer can still perceive a human face figure and the overall head motion. However, we show in our experiments that a fairly good approximation of the original video can be reconstructed in a way that compromises anonymity. Our system exploits the simultaneous similarity and small disparity between close-by video frames depicting a human face, and employs a spatial transformation component that learns the alignment between the pixelated frames. Each frame, supported by its aligned surrounding frames, is first encoded, then decoded to a higher resolution. Reconstruction and perceptual losses promote adherence to the ground-truth, and an adversarial loss assists in maintaining domain faithfulness. There is no need for explicit temporal coherency loss as it is maintained implicitly by the alignment of neighboring frames and reconstruction. Although simple, our framework synthesizes high-quality face reconstructions, demonstrating that given the statistical prior of a human face, multiple aligned pixelated frames contain sufficient information to reconstruct a high-quality approximation of the original signal.\n",
      "Electronic health records (EHRs) are longitudinal records of a patient's interactions with healthcare systems. A patient's EHR data is organized as a three-level hierarchy from top to bottom: patient journey - all the experiences of diagnoses and treatments over a period of time; individual visit - a set of medical codes in a particular visit; and medical code - a specific record in the form of medical codes. As EHRs begin to amass in millions, the potential benefits, which these data might hold for medical research and medical outcome prediction, are staggering - including, for example, predicting future admissions to hospitals, diagnosing illnesses or determining the efficacy of medical treatments. Each of these analytics tasks requires a domain knowledge extraction method to transform the hierarchical patient journey into a vector representation for further prediction procedure. The representations should embed a sequence of visits and a set of medical codes with a specific timestamp, which are crucial to any downstream prediction tasks. Hence, expressively powerful representations are appealing to boost learning performance. To this end, we propose a novel self-attention mechanism that captures the contextual dependency and temporal relationships within a patient's healthcare journey. An end-to-end bidirectional temporal encoder network (BiteNet) then learns representations of the patient's journeys, based solely on the proposed attention mechanism. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our methods on two supervised prediction and two unsupervised clustering tasks with a real-world EHR dataset. The empirical results demonstrate the proposed BiteNet model produces higher-quality representations than state-of-the-art baseline methods.\n",
      "Recently, inspired by Transformer, self-attention-based scene text recognition approaches have achieved outstanding performance. However, we find that the size of model expands rapidly with the lexicon increasing. Specifically, the number of parameters for softmax classification layer and output embedding layer are proportional to the vocabulary size. It hinders the development of a lightweight text recognition model especially applied for Chinese and multiple languages. Thus, we propose a lightweight scene text recognition model named Hamming OCR. In this model, a novel Hamming classifier, which adopts locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm to encode each character, is proposed to replace the softmax regression and the generated LSH code is directly employed to replace the output embedding. We also present a simplified transformer decoder to reduce the number of parameters by removing the feed-forward network and using cross-layer parameter sharing technique. Compared with traditional methods, the number of parameters in both classification and embedding layers is independent on the size of vocabulary, which significantly reduces the storage requirement without loss of accuracy. Experimental results on several datasets, including four public benchmaks and a Chinese text dataset synthesized by SynthText with more than 20,000 characters, shows that Hamming OCR achieves competitive results.\n",
      "Image fusion plays a vital role in medical imaging. Image fusion aims to integrate complementary as well as redundant information from multiple modalities into a single fused image without distortion or loss of information. In this research work, discrete wavelet transform (DWT)and undecimated discrete wavelet transform (UDWT)-based fusion techniques using genetic algorithm (GA)foroptimalparameter(weight)estimationinthefusionprocessareimplemented and analyzed with multi-modality brain images. The lack of shift variance while performing image fusion using DWT is addressed using UDWT. The proposed fusion model uses an efficient, modified GA in DWT and UDWT for optimal parameter estimation, to improve the image quality and contrast. The complexity of the basic GA (pixel level) has been reduced in the modified GA (feature level), by limiting the search space. It is observed from our experiments that fusion using DWT and UDWT techniques with GA for optimal parameter estimation resulted in a better fused image in the aspects of retaining the information and contrast without error, both in human perception as well as evaluation using objective metrics. The contributions of this research work are (1) reduced time and space complexity in estimating the weight values using GA for fusion (2) system is scalable for input image of any size with similar time complexity, owing to feature level GA implementation and (3) identification of source image that contributes more to the fused image, from the weight values estimated.\n",

We propose CameNN, which is a multi-task model with three tasks including Image to Text Alignment (ITA) task, Text to Image Alignment (TIA) task and CVR prediction task. We use pre-trained BERT to generate the text embedding and pre-trained InceptionV4 to generate image patch embedding (each image is split into small patches with the same pixels and treat each patch as an image token). Softmax gating networks follow to learn the weight of each transformer expert output and choose only a subset of experts conditioned on the input. Then transformer encoder is applied as the share-bottom layer to learn all input features' shared interaction. Next, mixture of transformer experts (MoE) layer is implemented to model different aspects of tasks. At top of the MoE layer, we deploy a transformer layer for each task as task tower to learn task-specific information. On the real word intra-city dataset, experiments demonstrate CameNN outperform baselines and achieve significant improvements on the image and text representation. In practice, we applied CameNN on CVR prediction in our intra-city recommender system which is one of the leading intra-city platforms operated in China.\n",

      "Urban ride-hailing demand prediction is a crucial but challenging task for intelligent transportation system construction. Predictable ride-hailing demand can facilitate more reasonable vehicle scheduling and online car-hailing platform dispatch. Conventional deep learning methods with no external structured data can be accomplished via hybrid models of CNNs and RNNs by meshing plentiful pixel-level labeled data, but spatial data sparsity and limited learning capabilities on temporal long-term dependencies are still two striking bottlenecks. To address these limitations, we propose a new virtual graph modeling method to focus on significant demand regions and a novel Deep Multi-View Spatiotemporal Virtual Graph Neural Network (DMVST-VGNN) to strengthen learning capabilities of spatial dynamics and temporal long-term dependencies. Specifically, DMVST-VGNN integrates the structures of 1D Convolutional Neural Network, Multi Graph Attention Neural Network and Transformer layer, which correspond to short-term temporal dynamics view, spatial dynamics view and long-term temporal dynamics view respectively. In this paper, experiments are conducted on two large-scale New York City datasets in fine-grained prediction scenes. And the experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of DMVST-VGNN framework in significant citywide ride-hailing demand prediction.\n",
      "Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to fit a mapping from patient state to a medication regimen. Prior studies have used deterministic and value-based tabular learning to learn a propofol dose from an observed anesthetic state. Deep RL replaces the table with a deep neural network and has been used to learn medication regimens from registry databases. Here we perform the first application of deep RL to closed-loop control of anesthetic dosing in a simulated environment. We use the cross-entropy method to train a deep neural network to map an observed anesthetic state to a probability of infusing a fixed propofol dosage. During testing, we implement a deterministic policy that transforms the probability of infusion to a continuous infusion rate. The model is trained and tested on simulated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models with randomized parameters to ensure robustness to patient variability. The deep RL agent significantly outperformed a proportional-integral-derivative controller (median absolute performance error 1.7% +/- 0.6 and 3.4% +/- 1.2). Modeling continuous input variables instead of a table affords more robust pattern recognition and utilizes our prior domain knowledge. Deep RL learned a smooth policy with a natural interpretation to data scientists and anesthesia care providers alike.\n",
      "Data often are formed of multiple modalities, which jointly describe the observed phenomena. Modeling the joint distribution of multimodal data requires larger expressive power to capture high-level concepts and provide better data representations. However, multimodal generative models based on variational inference are limited due to the lack of flexibility of the approximate posterior, which is obtained by searching within a known parametric family of distributions. We introduce a method that improves the representational capacity of multimodal variational methods using normalizing flows. It approximates the joint posterior with a simple parametric distribution and subsequently transforms into a more complex one. Through several experiments, we demonstrate that the model improves on state-of-the-art multimodal methods based on variational inference on various computer vision tasks such as colorization, edge and mask detection, and weakly supervised learning. We also show that learning more powerful approximate joint distributions improves the quality of the generated samples. The code of our model is publicly available at https://github.com/SashoNedelkoski/BPFDMVM.\n",

GPT-f found new short proofs that were accepted into the main Metamath library, which is to our knowledge, the first time a deep-learning based system has contributed proofs that were adopted by a formal mathematics community.\n",
      "In recent years, significant work has been done to include fairness constraints in the training objective of machine learning algorithms. Many state-of the-art algorithms tackle this challenge by learning a fair representation which captures all the relevant information to predict the output Y while not containing any information about a sensitive attribute S. In this paper, we propose an adversarial algorithm to learn unbiased representations via the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi (HGR) maximal correlation coefficient. We leverage recent work which has been done to estimate this coefficient by learning deep neural network transformations and use it as a minmax game to penalize the intrinsic bias in a multi dimensional latent representation. Compared to other dependence measures, the HGR coefficient captures more information about the non-linear dependencies with the sensitive variable, making the algorithm more efficient in mitigating bias in the representation. We empirically evaluate and compare our approach and demonstrate significant improvements over existing works in the field.\n"

      "Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques and is a key step to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. In the multi-party feature engineering scenario (features are stored in many different IoT devices), direct and unlimited multivariate feature transformations will quickly exhaust memory, power, and bandwidth of devices, not to mention the security of information threatened. Given this, we present a framework called FLFE to conduct privacy-preserving and communication-preserving multi-party feature transformations. The framework pre-learns the pattern of the feature to directly judge the usefulness of the transformation on a feature. Explored the new useful feature, the framework forsakes the encryption-based algorithm for the well-designed feature exchange mechanism, which largely decreases the communication overhead under the premise of confidentiality. We made experiments on datasets of both open-sourced and real-world thus validating the comparable effectiveness of FLFE to evaluation-based approaches, along with the far more superior efficacy.\n",
      "The ability to efficiently search for images over an indexed database is the cornerstone for several user experiences. Incorporating user feedback, through multi-modal inputs provide flexible and interaction to serve fine-grained specificity in requirements. We specifically focus on text feedback, through descriptive natural language queries. Given a reference image and textual user feedback, our goal is to retrieve images that satisfy constraints specified by both of these input modalities. The task is challenging as it requires understanding the textual semantics from the text feedback and then applying these changes to the visual representation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel architecture TRACE which contains a hierarchical feature aggregation module to learn the composite visio-linguistic representations. TRACE achieves the SOTA performance on 3 benchmark datasets: FashionIQ, Shoes, and Birds-to-Words, with an average improvement of at least ~5.7%, ~3%, and ~5% respectively in R@K metric. Our extensive experiments and ablation studies show that TRACE consistently outperforms the existing techniques by significant margins both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n",
      "Medical image datasets are usually imbalanced, due to the high costs of obtaining the data and time-consuming annotations. Training deep neural network models on such datasets to accurately classify the medical condition does not yield desired results and often over-fits the data on majority class samples. In order to address this issue, data augmentation is often performed on training data by position augmentation techniques such as scaling, cropping, flipping, padding, rotation, translation, affine transformation, and color augmentation techniques such as brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue to increase the dataset sizes. These augmentation techniques are not guaranteed to be advantageous in domains with limited data, especially medical image data, and could lead to further overfitting. In this work, we performed data augmentation on the Chest X-rays dataset through generative modeling (deep convolutional generative adversarial network) which creates artificial instances retaining similar characteristics to the original data and evaluation of the model resulted in Fr\\'echet Distance of Inception (FID) score of 1.289.\n",
      "Discriminative learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) aims to perform image restoration by learning from training examples of noisy-clean image pairs. It has become the go-to methodology for tackling image restoration and has outperformed the traditional non-local class of methods. However, the top-performing networks are generally composed of many convolutional layers and hundreds of neurons, with trainable parameters in excess of several millions. We claim that this is due to the inherent linear nature of convolution-based transformation, which is inadequate for handling severe restoration problems. Recently, a non-linear generalization of CNNs, called the operational neural networks (ONN), has been shown to outperform CNN on AWGN denoising. However, its formulation is burdened by a fixed collection of well-known nonlinear operators and an exhaustive search to find the best possible configuration for a given architecture, whose efficacy is further limited by a fixed output layer operator assignment. In this study, we leverage the Taylor series-based function approximation to propose a self-organizing variant of ONNs, Self-ONNs, for image restoration, which synthesizes novel nodal transformations onthe-fly as part of the learning process, thus eliminating the need for redundant training runs for operator search. In addition, it enables a finer level of operator heterogeneity by diversifying individual connections of the receptive fields and weights. We perform a series of extensive ablation experiments across three severe image restoration tasks. Even when a strict equivalence of learnable parameters is imposed, Self-ONNs surpass CNNs by a considerable margin across all problems, improving the generalization performance by up to 3 dB in terms of PSNR.\n",
      "Uncertainty quantification is a fundamental yet unsolved problem for deep learning. The Bayesian framework provides a principled way of uncertainty estimation but is often not scalable to modern deep neural nets (DNNs) that have a large number of parameters. Non-Bayesian methods are simple to implement but often conflate different sources of uncertainties and require huge computing resources. We propose a new method for quantifying uncertainties of DNNs from a dynamical system perspective. The core of our method is to view DNN transformations as state evolution of a stochastic dynamical system and introduce a Brownian motion term for capturing epistemic uncertainty. Based on this perspective, we propose a neural stochastic differential equation model (SDE-Net) which consists of (1) a drift net that controls the system to fit the predictive function; and (2) a diffusion net that captures epistemic uncertainty. We theoretically analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution to SDE-Net. Our experiments demonstrate that the SDE-Net model can outperform existing uncertainty estimation methods across a series of tasks where uncertainty plays a fundamental role.\n",
      "One of the major reasons for misclassification of multiplex actions during action recognition is the unavailability of complementary features that provide the semantic information about the actions. In different domains these features are present with different scales and intensities. In existing literature, features are extracted independently in different domains, but the benefits from fusing these multidomain features are not realized. To address this challenge and to extract complete set of complementary information, in this paper, we propose a novel multidomain multimodal fusion framework that extracts complementary and distinct features from different domains of the input modality. We transform input inertial data into signal images, and then make the input modality multidomain and multimodal by transforming spatial domain information into frequency and time-spectrum domain using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Gabor wavelet transform (GWT) respectively. Features in different domains are extracted by Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) and then fused by Canonical Correlation based Fusion (CCF) for improving the accuracy of human action recognition. Experimental results on three inertial datasets show the superiority of the proposed method when compared to the state-of-the-art.\n",
      "This paper attempts at improving the accuracy of Human Action Recognition (HAR) by fusion of depth and inertial sensor data. Firstly, we transform the depth data into Sequential Front view Images(SFI) and fine-tune the pre-trained AlexNet on these images. Then, inertial data is converted into Signal Images (SI) and another convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on these images. Finally, learned features are extracted from both CNN, fused together to make a shared feature layer, and these features are fed to the classifier. We experiment with two classifiers, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and softmax classifier and compare their performances. The recognition accuracies of each modality, depth data alone and sensor data alone are also calculated and compared with fusion based accuracies to highlight the fact that fusion of modalities yields better results than individual modalities. Experimental results on UTD-MHAD and Kinect 2D datasets show that proposed method achieves state of the art results when compared to other recently proposed visual-inertial action recognition methods.\n",
      "Transformers have increasingly outperformed gated RNNs in obtaining new state-of-the-art results on supervised tasks involving text sequences. Inspired by this trend, we study the question of how Transformer-based models can improve the performance of sequential decision-making agents. We present the Working Memory Graph (WMG), an agent that employs multi-head self-attention to reason over a dynamic set of vectors representing observed and recurrent state. We evaluate WMG in three environments featuring factored observation spaces: a Pathfinding environment that requires complex reasoning over past observations, BabyAI gridworld levels that involve variable goals, and Sokoban which emphasizes future planning. We find that the combination of WMG's Transformer-based architecture with factored observation spaces leads to significant gains in learning efficiency compared to baseline architectures across all tasks. WMG demonstrates how Transformer-based models can dramatically boost sample efficiency in RL environments for which observations can be factored.\n",
      "In reinforcement learning, wrappers are universally used to transform the information that passes between a model and an environment. Despite their ubiquity, no library exists with reasonable implementations of all popular preprocessing methods. This leads to unnecessary bugs, code inefficiencies, and wasted developer time. Accordingly we introduce SuperSuit, a Python library that includes all popular wrappers, and wrappers that can easily apply lambda functions to the observations/actions/reward. It's compatible with the standard Gym environment specification, as well as the PettingZoo specification for multi-agent environments. The library is available at https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/SuperSuit,and can be installed via pip.\n",
      "Classifiers in machine learning are often brittle when deployed. Particularly concerning are models with inconsistent performance on specific subgroups of a class, e.g., exhibiting disparities in skin cancer classification in the presence or absence of a spurious bandage. To mitigate these performance differences, we introduce model patching, a two-stage framework for improving robustness that encourages the model to be invariant to subgroup differences, and focus on class information shared by subgroups. Model patching first models subgroup features within a class and learns semantic transformations between them, and then trains a classifier with data augmentations that deliberately manipulate subgroup features. We instantiate model patching with CAMEL, which (1) uses a CycleGAN to learn the intra-class, inter-subgroup augmentations, and (2) balances subgroup performance using a theoretically-motivated subgroup consistency regularizer, accompanied by a new robust objective. We demonstrate CAMEL's effectiveness on 3 benchmark datasets, with reductions in robust error of up to 33% relative to the best baseline. Lastly, CAMEL successfully patches a model that fails due to spurious features on a real-world skin cancer dataset.\n",
      "We investigate how reinforcement learning can be used to train level-designing agents. This represents a new approach to procedural content generation in games, where level design is framed as a game, and the content generator itself is learned. By seeing the design problem as a sequential task, we can use reinforcement learning to learn how to take the next action so that the expected final level quality is maximized. This approach can be used when few or no examples exist to train from, and the trained generator is very fast. We investigate three different ways of transforming two-dimensional level design problems into Markov decision processes and apply these to three game environments.\n",
      "Camera-based end-to-end driving neural networks bring the promise of a low-cost system that maps camera images to driving control commands. These networks are appealing because they replace laborious hand engineered building blocks but their black-box nature makes them difficult to delve in case of failure. Recent works have shown the importance of using an explicit intermediate representation that has the benefits of increasing both the interpretability and the accuracy of networks' decisions. Nonetheless, these camera-based networks reason in camera view where scale is not homogeneous and hence not directly suitable for motion forecasting. In this paper, we introduce a novel monocular camera-only holistic end-to-end trajectory planning network with a Bird-Eye-View (BEV) intermediate representation that comes in the form of binary Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs). To ease the prediction of OGMs in BEV from camera images, we introduce a novel scheme where the OGMs are first predicted as semantic masks in camera view and then warped in BEV using the homography between the two planes. The key element allowing this transformation to be applied to 3D objects such as vehicles, consists in predicting solely their footprint in camera-view, hence respecting the flat world hypothesis implied by the homography.\n",
      "In this work, we formulate a visual dialog as an information flow in which each piece of information is encoded with the joint visual-linguistic representation of a single dialog round. Based on this formulation, we consider the visual dialog task as a sequence problem consisting of ordered visual-linguistic vectors. For featurization, we use a Dense Symmetric Co-Attention network as a lightweight vison-language joint representation generator to fuse multimodal features (i.e., image and text), yielding better computation and data efficiencies. For inference, we propose two Sequential Dialog Networks (SeqDialN): the first uses LSTM for information propagation (IP) and the second uses a modified Transformer for multi-step reasoning (MR). Our architecture separates the complexity of multimodal feature fusion from that of inference, which allows simpler design of the inference engine. IP based SeqDialN is our baseline with a simple 2-layer LSTM design that achieves decent performance. MR based SeqDialN, on the other hand, recurrently refines the semantic question/history representations through the self-attention stack of Transformer and produces promising results on the visual dialog task. On VisDial v1.0 test-std dataset, our best single generative SeqDialN achieves 62.54% NDCG and 48.63% MRR; our ensemble generative SeqDialN achieves 63.78% NDCG and 49.98% MRR, which set a new state-of-the-art generative visual dialog model. We fine-tune discriminative SeqDialN with dense annotations and boost the performance up to 72.41% NDCG and 55.11% MRR. In this work, we discuss the extensive experiments we have conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model components. We also provide visualization for the reasoning process from the relevant conversation rounds and discuss our fine-tuning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiaoxiaoheimei/SeqDialN\n",
      "This supplementary material aims to describe the proposed multi-label classification (MLC) search spaces based on the MEKA and WEKA softwares. First, we overview 26 MLC algorithms and meta-algorithms in MEKA, presenting their main characteristics, such as hyper-parameters, dependencies and constraints. Second, we review 28 single-label classification (SLC) algorithms, preprocessing algorithms and meta-algorithms in the WEKA software. These SLC algorithms were also studied because they are part of the proposed MLC search spaces. Fundamentally, this occurs due to the problem transformation nature of several MLC algorithms used in this work. These algorithms transform an MLC problem into one or several SLC problems in the first place and solve them with SLC model(s) in a next step. Therefore, understanding their main characteristics is crucial to this work. Finally, we present a formal description of the search spaces by proposing a context-free grammar that encompasses the 54 learning algorithms. This grammar basically comprehends the possible combinations, the constraints and dependencies among the learning algorithms.\n",
      "Although duality is used extensively in certain fields, such as supervised learning in machine learning, it has been much less explored in others, such as reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we show how duality is involved in a variety of RL work, from that which spearheaded the field, such as Richard Bellman's value iteration, to that which was done within just the past few years yet has already had significant impact, such as TRPO, A3C, and GAIL. We show that duality is not uncommon in reinforcement learning, especially when value iteration, or dynamic programming, is used or when first or second order approximations are made to transform initially intractable problems into tractable convex programs.\n",
      "To get clear street-view and photo-realistic simulation in autonomous driving, we present an automatic video inpainting algorithm that can remove traffic agents from videos and synthesize missing regions with the guidance of depth/point cloud. By building a dense 3D map from stitched point clouds, frames within a video are geometrically correlated via this common 3D map. In order to fill a target inpainting area in a frame, it is straightforward to transform pixels from other frames into the current one with correct occlusion. Furthermore, we are able to fuse multiple videos through 3D point cloud registration, making it possible to inpaint a target video with multiple source videos. The motivation is to solve the long-time occlusion problem where an occluded area has never been visible in the entire video. To our knowledge, we are the first to fuse multiple videos for video inpainting. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we build a large inpainting dataset in the real urban road environment with synchronized images and Lidar data including many challenge scenes, e.g., long time occlusion. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for all the criteria, especially the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) has been reduced by about 13%.\n",
      "We formalize and study ``programming by rewards'' (PBR), a new approach for specifying and synthesizing subroutines for optimizing some quantitative metric such as performance, resource utilization, or correctness over a benchmark. A PBR specification consists of (1) input features $x$, and (2) a reward function $r$, modeled as a black-box component (which we can only run), that assigns a reward for each execution. The goal of the synthesizer is to synthesize a \"decision function\" $f$ which transforms the features to a decision value for the black-box component so as to maximize the expected reward $E[r \\circ f (x)]$ for executing decisions $f(x)$ for various values of $x$. We consider a space of decision functions in a DSL of loop-free if-then-else programs, which can branch on linear functions of the input features in a tree-structure and compute a linear function of the inputs in the leaves of the tree. We find that this DSL captures decision functions that are manually written in practice by programmers. Our technical contribution is the use of continuous-optimization techniques to perform synthesis of such decision functions as if-then-else programs. We also show that the framework is theoretically-founded ---in cases when the rewards satisfy nice properties, the synthesized code is optimal in a precise sense.   We have leveraged PBR to synthesize non-trivial decision functions related to search and ranking heuristics in the PROSE codebase (an industrial strength program synthesis framework) and achieve competitive results to manually written procedures over multiple man years of tuning. We present empirical evaluation against other baseline techniques over real-world case studies (including PROSE) as well on simple synthetic benchmarks.\n",
      "Data augmentation is a powerful technique to improve performance in applications such as image and text classification tasks. Yet, there is little rigorous understanding of why and how various augmentations work. In this work, we consider a family of linear transformations and study their effects on the ridge estimator in an over-parametrized linear regression setting. First, we show that transformations which preserve the labels of the data can improve estimation by enlarging the span of the training data. Second, we show that transformations which mix data can improve estimation by playing a regularization effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical insights on MNIST. Based on the insights, we propose an augmentation scheme that searches over the space of transformations by how uncertain the model is about the transformed data. We validate our proposed scheme on image and text datasets. For example, our method outperforms RandAugment by 1.24% on CIFAR-100 using Wide-ResNet-28-10. Furthermore, we achieve comparable accuracy to the SoTA Adversarial AutoAugment on CIFAR datasets.\n",
      "In Reinforcement Learning (RL), Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have been successfully applied as function approximators in Deep Q-Learning algorithms, which seek to learn action-value functions and policies in various environments. However, to date, there has been little work on the learning of symmetry-transformation equivariant representations of the input environment state. In this paper, we propose the use of Equivariant CNNs to train RL agents and study their inductive bias for transformation equivariant Q-value approximation. We demonstrate that equivariant architectures can dramatically enhance the performance and sample efficiency of RL agents in a highly symmetric environment while requiring fewer parameters. Additionally, we show that they are robust to changes in the environment caused by affine transformations.\n",
      "In this paper we introduce the temporally factorized 3D convolution (3TConv) as an interpretable alternative to the regular 3D convolution (3DConv). In a 3TConv the 3D convolutional filter is obtained by learning a 2D filter and a set of temporal transformation parameters, resulting in a sparse filter where the 2D slices are sequentially dependent on each other in the temporal dimension. We demonstrate that 3TConv learns temporal transformations that afford a direct interpretation. The temporal parameters can be used in combination with various existing 2D visualization methods. We also show that insight about what the model learns can be achieved by analyzing the transformation parameter statistics on a layer and model level. Finally, we implicitly demonstrate that, in popular ConvNets, the 2DConv can be replaced with a 3TConv and that the weights can be transferred to yield pretrained 3TConvs. pretrained 3TConvnets leverage more than a decade of work on traditional 2DConvNets by being able to make use of features that have been proven to deliver excellent results on image classification benchmarks.\n",
      "Retrosynthetic planning is a critical task in organic chemistry which identifies a series of reactions that can lead to the synthesis of a target product. The vast number of possible chemical transformations makes the size of the search space very big, and retrosynthetic planning is challenging even for experienced chemists. However, existing methods either require expensive return estimation by rollout with high variance, or optimize for search speed rather than the quality. In this paper, we propose Retro*, a neural-based A*-like algorithm that finds high-quality synthetic routes efficiently. It maintains the search as an AND-OR tree, and learns a neural search bias with off-policy data. Then guided by this neural network, it performs best-first search efficiently during new planning episodes. Experiments on benchmark USPTO datasets show that, our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art with respect to both the success rate and solution quality, while being more efficient at the same time.\n",
      "Various factorization-based methods have been proposed to leverage second-order, or higher-order cross features for boosting the performance of predictive models. They generally enumerate all the cross features under a predefined maximum order, and then identify useful feature interactions through model training, which suffer from two drawbacks. First, they have to make a trade-off between the expressiveness of higher-order cross features and the computational cost, resulting in suboptimal predictions. Second, enumerating all the cross features, including irrelevant ones, may introduce noisy feature combinations that degrade model performance. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Factorization Network (AFN), a new model that learns arbitrary-order cross features adaptively from data. The core of AFN is a logarithmic transformation layer to convert the power of each feature in a feature combination into the coefficient to be learned. The experimental results on four real datasets demonstrate the superior predictive performance of AFN against the start-of-the-arts.\n",
      "We consider the extreme multi-label text classification (XMC) problem: given an input text, return the most relevant labels from a large label collection. For example, the input text could be a product description on Amazon.com and the labels could be product categories. XMC is an important yet challenging problem in the NLP community. Recently, deep pretrained transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks including sentence classification, albeit with small label sets. However, naively applying deep transformer models to the XMC problem leads to sub-optimal performance due to the large output space and the label sparsity issue. In this paper, we propose X-Transformer, the first scalable approach to fine-tuning deep transformer models for the XMC problem. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on four XMC benchmark datasets. In particular, on a Wiki dataset with around 0.5 million labels, the prec@1 of X-Transformer is 77.28%, a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art XMC approaches Parabel (linear) and AttentionXML (neural), which achieve 68.70% and 76.95% precision@1, respectively. We further apply X-Transformer to a product2query dataset from Amazon and gained 10.7% relative improvement on prec@1 over Parabel.\n",
      "Reasoning about graphs evolving over time is a challenging concept in many domains, such as bioinformatics, physics, and social networks. We consider a common case in which edges can be short term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both expensive to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component provides more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges. We also propose a bilinear transformation layer for pairs of node features instead of concatenation, typically used in prior work, and demonstrate its superior performance in all cases. In experiments on two datasets in the dynamic link prediction task, our model often outperforms the baseline model that requires a human-specified graph. Moreover, our learned attention is semantically interpretable and infers connections similar to actual graphs.\n",
      "Generalization Performance of Deep Learning models trained using Empirical Risk Minimization can be improved significantly by using Data Augmentation strategies such as simple transformations, or using Mixed Samples. We attempt to empirically analyze the impact of such strategies on the transfer of generalization between teacher and student models in a distillation setup. We observe that if a teacher is trained using any of the mixed sample augmentation strategies, such as MixUp or CutMix, the student model distilled from it is impaired in its generalization capabilities. We hypothesize that such strategies limit a model's capability to learn example-specific features, leading to a loss in quality of the supervision signal during distillation. We present a novel Class-Discrimination metric to quantitatively measure this dichotomy in performance and link it to the discriminative capacity induced by the different strategies on a network's latent space.\n",
      "In the Transformer model, \"self-attention\" combines information from attended embeddings into the representation of the focal embedding in the next layer. Thus, across layers of the Transformer, information originating from different tokens gets increasingly mixed. This makes attention weights unreliable as explanations probes. In this paper, we consider the problem of quantifying this flow of information through self-attention. We propose two methods for approximating the attention to input tokens given attention weights, attention rollout and attention flow, as post hoc methods when we use attention weights as the relative relevance of the input tokens. We show that these methods give complementary views on the flow of information, and compared to raw attention, both yield higher correlations with importance scores of input tokens obtained using an ablation method and input gradients.\n",
      "Spatio-temporal sequence forecasting is one of the fundamental tasks in spatio-temporal data mining. It facilitates many real world applications such as precipitation nowcasting, citywide crowd flow prediction and air pollution forecasting. Recently, a few Seq2Seq based approaches have been proposed, but one of the drawbacks of Seq2Seq models is that, small errors can accumulate quickly along the generated sequence at the inference stage due to the different distributions of training and inference phase. That is because Seq2Seq models minimise single step errors only during training, however the entire sequence has to be generated during the inference phase which generates a discrepancy between training and inference. In this work, we propose a novel curriculum learning based strategy named Temporal Progressive Growing Sampling to effectively bridge the gap between training and inference for spatio-temporal sequence forecasting, by transforming the training process from a fully-supervised manner which utilises all available previous ground-truth values to a less-supervised manner which replaces some of the ground-truth context with generated predictions. To do that we sample the target sequence from midway outputs from intermediate models trained with bigger timescales through a carefully designed decaying strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method better models long term dependencies and outperforms baseline approaches on two competitive datasets.\n",
      "The current Air Traffic Management (ATM) system worldwide has reached its limits in terms of predictability, efficiency and cost effectiveness. Different initiatives worldwide propose trajectory-oriented transformations that require high fidelity aircraft trajectory planning and prediction capabilities, supporting the trajectory life cycle at all stages efficiently. Recently proposed data-driven trajectory prediction approaches provide promising results. In this paper we approach the data-driven trajectory prediction problem as an imitation learning task, where we aim to imitate experts \"shaping\" the trajectory. Towards this goal we present a comprehensive framework comprising the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning state of the art method, in a pipeline with trajectory clustering and classification methods. This approach, compared to other approaches, can provide accurate predictions for the whole trajectory (i.e. with a prediction horizon until reaching the destination) both at the pre-tactical (i.e. starting at the departure airport at a specific time instant) and at the tactical (i.e. from any state while flying) stages, compared to state of the art approaches.\n",
      "Traditional clustering methods are limited when dealing with huge and heterogeneous groups of gene expression data, which motivates the development of bi-clustering methods. Bi-clustering methods are used to mine bi-clusters whose subsets of samples (genes) are co-regulated under their test conditions. Studies show that mining bi-clusters of consistent trends and trends with similar degrees of fluctuations from the gene expression data is essential in bioinformatics research. Unfortunately, traditional bi-clustering methods are not fully effective in discovering such bi-clusters. Therefore, we propose a novel bi-clustering method by involving here the theory of Granular Computing. In the proposed scheme, the gene data matrix, considered as a group of time series, is transformed into a series of ordered information granules. With the information granules we build a characteristic matrix of the gene data to capture the fluctuation trend of the expression value between consecutive conditions to mine the ideal bi-clusters. The experimental results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis, and show the excellent performance of the proposed method.\n",
      "Action delays degrade the performance of reinforcement learning in many real-world systems. This paper proposes a formal definition of delay-aware Markov Decision Process and proves it can be transformed into standard MDP with augmented states using the Markov reward process. We develop a delay-aware model-based reinforcement learning framework that can incorporate the multi-step delay into the learned system models without learning effort. Experiments with the Gym and MuJoCo platforms show that the proposed delay-aware model-based algorithm is more efficient in training and transferable between systems with various durations of delay compared with off-policy model-free reinforcement learning methods.

      "Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Belief Propagation (BP) are the most popular algorithms for computational inference in Graphical Models (GM). In principle, MCMC is an exact probabilistic method which, however, often suffers from exponentially slow mixing. In contrast, BP is a deterministic method, which is typically fast, empirically very successful, however in general lacking control of accuracy over loopy graphs. In this paper, we introduce MCMC algorithms correcting the approximation error of BP, i.e., we provide a way to compensate for BP errors via a consecutive BP-aware MCMC. Our framework is based on the Loop Calculus (LC) approach which allows expressing the BP error as a sum of weighted generalized loops. Although the full series is computationally intractable, it is known that a truncated series, summing up all 2-regular loops, is computable in polynomial-time for planar pair-wise binary GMs and it also provides a highly accurate approximation empirically. Motivated by this, we first propose a polynomial-time approximation MCMC scheme for the truncated series of general (non-planar) pair-wise binary models. Our main idea here is to use the Worm algorithm, known to provide fast mixing in other (related) problems, and then design an appropriate rejection scheme to sample 2-regular loops. Furthermore, we also design an efficient rejection-free MCMC scheme for approximating the full series. The main novelty underlying our design is in utilizing the concept of cycle basis, which provides an efficient decomposition of the generalized loops. In essence, the proposed MCMC schemes run on transformed GM built upon the non-trivial BP solution, and our experiments show that this synthesis of BP and MCMC outperforms both direct MCMC and bare BP schemes.\n",
      "Models which estimate main effects of individual variables alongside interaction effects have an identifiability challenge: effects can be freely moved between main effects and interaction effects without changing the model prediction. This is a critical problem for interpretability because it permits \"contradictory\" models to represent the same function. To solve this problem, we propose pure interaction effects: variance in the outcome which cannot be represented by any smaller subset of features. This definition has an equivalence with the Functional ANOVA decomposition. To compute this decomposition, we present a fast, exact algorithm that transforms any piecewise-constant function (such as a tree-based model) into a purified, canonical representation. We apply this algorithm to Generalized Additive Models with interactions trained on several datasets and show large disparity, including contradictions, between the effects before and after purification. These results underscore the need to specify data distributions and ensure identifiability before interpreting model parameters.\n",
      "Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations to predict missing facts. KGs often exhibit hierarchical and logical patterns which must be preserved in the embedding space. For hierarchical data, hyperbolic embedding methods have shown promise for high-fidelity and parsimonious representations. However, existing hyperbolic embedding methods do not account for the rich logical patterns in KGs. In this work, we introduce a class of hyperbolic KG embedding models that simultaneously capture hierarchical and logical patterns. Our approach combines hyperbolic reflections and rotations with attention to model complex relational patterns. Experimental results on standard KG benchmarks show that our method improves over previous Euclidean- and hyperbolic-based efforts by up to 6.1% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) in low dimensions. Furthermore, we observe that different geometric transformations capture different types of relations while attention-based transformations generalize to multiple relations. In high dimensions, our approach yields new state-of-the-art MRRs of 49.6% on WN18RR and 57.7% on YAGO3-10.\n",
      "Following a navigation instruction such as 'Walk down the stairs and stop at the brown sofa' requires embodied AI agents to ground scene elements referenced via language (e.g. 'stairs') to visual content in the environment (pixels corresponding to 'stairs').   We ask the following question -- can we leverage abundant 'disembodied' web-scraped vision-and-language corpora (e.g. Conceptual Captions) to learn visual groundings (what do 'stairs' look like?) that improve performance on a relatively data-starved embodied perception task (Vision-and-Language Navigation)? Specifically, we develop VLN-BERT, a visiolinguistic transformer-based model for scoring the compatibility between an instruction ('...stop at the brown sofa') and a sequence of panoramic RGB images captured by the agent. We demonstrate that pretraining VLN-BERT on image-text pairs from the web before fine-tuning on embodied path-instruction data significantly improves performance on VLN -- outperforming the prior state-of-the-art in the fully-observed setting by 4 absolute percentage points on success rate. Ablations of our pretraining curriculum show each stage to be impactful -- with their combination resulting in further positive synergistic effects.\n",
      "Hyperdimensional (HD) computing is built upon its unique data type referred to as hypervectors. The dimension of these hypervectors is typically in the range of tens of thousands. Proposed to solve cognitive tasks, HD computing aims at calculating similarity among its data. Data transformation is realized by three operations, including addition, multiplication and permutation. Its ultra-wide data representation introduces redundancy against noise. Since information is evenly distributed over every bit of the hypervectors, HD computing is inherently robust. Additionally, due to the nature of those three operations, HD computing leads to fast learning ability, high energy efficiency and acceptable accuracy in learning and classification tasks. This paper introduces the background of HD computing, and reviews the data representation, data transformation, and similarity measurement. The orthogonality in high dimensions presents opportunities for flexible computing. To balance the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, strategies include but are not limited to encoding, retraining, binarization and hardware acceleration. Evaluations indicate that HD computing shows great potential in addressing problems using data in the form of letters, signals and images. HD computing especially shows significant promise to replace machine learning algorithms as a light-weight classifier in the field of internet of things (IoTs).\n",
      "What does it take to design a machine that learns to answer natural questions about a video? A Video QA system must simultaneously understand language, represent visual content over space-time, and iteratively transform these representations in response to lingual content in the query, and finally arriving at a sensible answer. While recent advances in lingual and visual question answering have enabled sophisticated representations and neural reasoning mechanisms, major challenges in Video QA remain on dynamic grounding of concepts, relations and actions to support the reasoning process. Inspired by the dual-process account of human reasoning, we design a dual process neural architecture, which is composed of a question-guided video processing module (System 1, fast and reactive) followed by a generic reasoning module (System 2, slow and deliberative). System 1 is a hierarchical model that encodes visual patterns about objects, actions and relations in space-time given the textual cues from the question. The encoded representation is a set of high-level visual features, which are then passed to System 2. Here multi-step inference follows to iteratively chain visual elements as instructed by the textual elements. The system is evaluated on the SVQA (synthetic) and TGIF-QA datasets (real), demonstrating competitive results, with a large margin in the case of multi-step reasoning.\n",
      "Recent developments in Transformers have opened new interesting areas of research in partially observable reinforcement learning tasks. Results from late 2019 showed that Transformers are able to outperform LSTMs on both memory intense and reactive tasks. In this work we first partially replicate the results shown in Stabilizing Transformers in RL on both reactive and memory based environments. We then show performance improvement coupled with reduced computation when adding adaptive attention span to this Stable Transformer on a challenging DMLab30 environment.

      "We present an electrocardiogram (ECG) -based emotion recognition system using self-supervised learning. Our proposed architecture consists of two main networks, a signal transformation recognition network and an emotion recognition network. First, unlabelled data are used to successfully train the former network to detect specific pre-determined signal transformations in the self-supervised learning step. Next, the weights of the convolutional layers of this network are transferred to the emotion recognition network, and two dense layers are trained in order to classify arousal and valence scores. We show that our self-supervised approach helps the model learn the ECG feature manifold required for emotion recognition, performing equal or better than the fully-supervised version of the model. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in ECG-based emotion recognition with two publicly available datasets, SWELL and AMIGOS. Further analysis highlights the advantage of our self-supervised approach in requiring significantly less data to achieve acceptable results.\n",
      "We propose D3VO as a novel framework for monocular visual odometry that exploits deep networks on three levels -- deep depth, pose and uncertainty estimation. We first propose a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation network trained on stereo videos without any external supervision. In particular, it aligns the training image pairs into similar lighting condition with predictive brightness transformation parameters. Besides, we model the photometric uncertainties of pixels on the input images, which improves the depth estimation accuracy and provides a learned weighting function for the photometric residuals in direct (feature-less) visual odometry. Evaluation results show that the proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised depth estimation networks. D3VO tightly incorporates the predicted depth, pose and uncertainty into a direct visual odometry method to boost both the front-end tracking as well as the back-end non-linear optimization. We evaluate D3VO in terms of monocular visual odometry on both the KITTI odometry benchmark and the EuRoC MAV dataset.The results show that D3VO outperforms state-of-the-art traditional monocular VO methods by a large margin. It also achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art stereo/LiDAR odometry on KITTI and to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry on EuRoC MAV, while using only a single camera.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a novel method for transforming data into a low-dimensional space optimized for one-class classification. The proposed method iteratively transforms data into a new subspace optimized for ellipsoidal encapsulation of target class data. We provide both linear and non-linear formulations for the proposed method. The method takes into account the covariance of the data in the subspace; hence, it yields a more generalized solution as compared to Subspace Support Vector Data Description for a hypersphere. We propose different regularization terms expressing the class variance in the projected space. We compare the results with classic and recently proposed one-class classification methods and achieve better results in the majority of cases. The proposed method is also noticed to converge much faster than recently proposed Subspace Support Vector Data Description.\n",
      "Gradient-based approximate inference methods, such as Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), provide simple and general-purpose inference engines for differentiable continuous distributions. However, existing forms of SVGD cannot be directly applied to discrete distributions. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a simple yet general framework that transforms discrete distributions to equivalent piecewise continuous distributions, on which the gradient-free SVGD is applied to perform efficient approximate inference. The empirical results show that our method outperforms traditional algorithms such as Gibbs sampling and discontinuous Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on various challenging benchmarks of discrete graphical models. We demonstrate that our method provides a promising tool for learning ensembles of binarized neural network (BNN), outperforming other widely used ensemble methods on learning binarized AlexNet on CIFAR-10 dataset. In addition, such transform can be straightforwardly employed in gradient-free kernelized Stein discrepancy to perform goodness-of-fit (GOF) test on discrete distributions. Our proposed method outperforms existing GOF test methods for intractable discrete distributions.\n",
      "Building on recent work on capsule networks, we propose a new, general-purpose form of \"routing by agreement\" that activates output capsules in a layer as a function of their net benefit to use and net cost to ignore input capsules from earlier layers. To illustrate the usefulness of our routing algorithm, we present two capsule networks that apply it in different domains: vision and language. The first network achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.1% on the smallNORB visual recognition task with fewer parameters and an order of magnitude less training than previous capsule models, and we find evidence that it learns to perform a form of \"reverse graphics.\" The second network achieves new state-of-the-art accuracies on the root sentences of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank: 58.5% on fine-grained and 95.6% on binary labels with a single-task model that routes frozen embeddings from a pretrained transformer as capsules. In both domains, we train with the same regime. Code is available at https://github.com/glassroom/heinsen_routing along with replication instructions.\n",
      "The lottery ticket hypothesis proposes that over-parameterization of deep neural networks (DNNs) aids training by increasing the probability of a \"lucky\" sub-network initialization being present rather than by helping the optimization process (Frankle & Carbin, 2019). Intriguingly, this phenomenon suggests that initialization strategies for DNNs can be improved substantially, but the lottery ticket hypothesis has only previously been tested in the context of supervised learning for natural image tasks. Here, we evaluate whether \"winning ticket\" initializations exist in two different domains: natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL).For NLP, we examined both recurrent LSTM models and large-scale Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017). For RL, we analyzed a number of discrete-action space tasks, including both classic control and pixel control. Consistent with workin supervised image classification, we confirm that winning ticket initializations generally outperform parameter-matched random initializations, even at extreme pruning rates for both NLP and RL. Notably, we are able to find winning ticket initializations for Transformers which enable models one-third the size to achieve nearly equivalent performance. Together, these results suggest that the lottery ticket hypothesis is not restricted to supervised learning of natural images, but rather represents a broader phenomenon in DNNs.\n",
      "Spatial and time-dependent data is of interest in many applications. This task is difficult due to its complex spatial dependency, long-range temporal dependency, data non-stationarity, and data heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose Forecaster, a graph Transformer architecture. Specifically, we start by learning the structure of the graph that parsimoniously represents the spatial dependency between the data at different locations. Based on the topology of the graph, we sparsify the Transformer to account for the strength of spatial dependency, long-range temporal dependency, data non-stationarity, and data heterogeneity. We evaluate Forecaster in the problem of forecasting taxi ride-hailing demand and show that our proposed architecture significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.\n",
      "Tasks involving localization, memorization and planning in partially observable 3D environments are an ongoing challenge in Deep Reinforcement Learning. We present EgoMap, a spatially structured neural memory architecture. EgoMap augments a deep reinforcement learning agent's performance in 3D environments on challenging tasks with multi-step objectives. The EgoMap architecture incorporates several inductive biases including a differentiable inverse projection of CNN feature vectors onto a top-down spatially structured map. The map is updated with ego-motion measurements through a differentiable affine transform. We show this architecture outperforms both standard recurrent agents and state of the art agents with structured memory. We demonstrate that incorporating these inductive biases into an agent's architecture allows for stable training with reward alone, circumventing the expense of acquiring and labelling expert trajectories. A detailed ablation study demonstrates the impact of key aspects of the architecture and through extensive qualitative analysis, we show how the agent exploits its structured internal memory to achieve higher performance.\n",
      "We consider the problem of discriminatively learning restricted Boltzmann machines in the presence of relational data. Unlike previous approaches that employ a rule learner (for structure learning) and a weight learner (for parameter learning) sequentially, we develop a gradient-boosted approach that performs both simultaneously. Our approach learns a set of weak relational regression trees, whose paths from root to leaf are conjunctive clauses and represent the structure, and whose leaf values represent the parameters. When the learned relational regression trees are transformed into a lifted RBM, its hidden nodes are precisely the conjunctive clauses derived from the relational regression trees. This leads to a more interpretable and explainable model. Our empirical evaluations clearly demonstrate this aspect, while displaying no loss in effectiveness of the learned models.\n",
      "Open-domain dialog generation is a challenging problem; maximum likelihood training can lead to repetitive outputs, models have difficulty tracking long-term conversational goals, and training on standard movie or online datasets may lead to the generation of inappropriate, biased, or offensive text. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework that could potentially address these issues, for example by allowing a dialog model to optimize for reducing toxicity and repetitiveness. However, previous approaches which apply RL to open-domain dialog generation do so at the word level, making it difficult for the model to learn proper credit assignment for long-term conversational rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning, VHRL, which uses policy gradients to tune the utterance-level embedding of a variational sequence model. This hierarchical approach provides greater flexibility for learning long-term, conversational rewards. We use self-play and RL to optimize for a set of human-centered conversation metrics, and show that our approach provides significant improvements -- in terms of both human evaluation and automatic metrics -- over state-of-the-art dialog models, including Transformers.\n",
      "Gaussian processes are the leading class of distributions on random functions, but they suffer from well known issues including difficulty scaling and inflexibility with respect to certain shape constraints (such as nonnegativity). Here we propose Deep Random Splines, a flexible class of random functions obtained by transforming Gaussian noise through a deep neural network whose output are the parameters of a spline. Unlike Gaussian processes, Deep Random Splines allow us to readily enforce shape constraints while inheriting the richness and tractability of deep generative models. We also present an observational model for point process data which uses Deep Random Splines to model the intensity function of each point process and apply it to neural population data to obtain a low-dimensional representation of spiking activity. Inference is performed via a variational autoencoder that uses a novel recurrent encoder architecture that can handle multiple point processes as input. We use a newly collected dataset where a primate completes a pedaling task, and observe better dimensionality reduction with our model than with competing alternatives.\n",
      "When playing video-games we immediately detect which entity we control and we center the attention towards it to focus the learning and reduce its dimensionality. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been able to deal with big state spaces, including states derived from pixel images in Atari games, but the learning is slow, depends on the brute force mapping from the global state to the action values (Q-function), thus its performance is severely affected by the dimensionality of the state and cannot be transferred to other games or other parts of the same game. We propose different transformations of the input state that combine attention and agency detection mechanisms which both have been addressed separately in RL but not together to our knowledge. We propose and benchmark different architectures including both global and local agency centered versions of the state and also including summaries of the surroundings. Results suggest that even a redundant global-local state network can learn faster than the global alone. Summarized versions of the state look promising to achieve input-size independence learning.\n",
      "The goal of program synthesis is to automatically generate programs in a particular language from corresponding specifications, e.g. input-output behavior. Many current approaches achieve impressive results after training on randomly generated I/O examples in limited domain-specific languages (DSLs), as with string transformations in RobustFill. However, we empirically discover that applying test input generation techniques for languages with control flow and rich input space causes deep networks to generalize poorly to certain data distributions; to correct this, we propose a new methodology for controlling and evaluating the bias of synthetic data distributions over both programs and specifications. We demonstrate, using the Karel DSL and a small Calculator DSL, that training deep networks on these distributions leads to improved cross-distribution generalization performance.\n",
      "NumPyro is a lightweight library that provides an alternate NumPy backend to the Pyro probabilistic programming language with the same modeling interface, language primitives and effect handling abstractions. Effect handlers allow Pyro's modeling API to be extended to NumPyro despite its being built atop a fundamentally different JAX-based functional backend. In this work, we demonstrate the power of composing Pyro's effect handlers with the program transformations that enable hardware acceleration, automatic differentiation, and vectorization in JAX. In particular, NumPyro provides an iterative formulation of the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) that can be end-to-end JIT compiled, yielding an implementation that is much faster than existing alternatives in both the small and large dataset regimes.\n",
      "Time serie classification is used in a diverse range of domain such as meteorology, medicine and physics. It aims to classify chronological data. Many accurate approaches have been built during the last decade and shapelet transformation is one of them. However, none of these approaches does take data uncertainty into account. Using uncertainty propagation techiniques, we propose a new dissimilarity measure based on euclidean distance. We also show how to use this new measure to adapt shapelet transformation to uncertain time series classification. An experimental assessment of our contribution is done on some state of the art datasets.\n",
      "Exterior contour and interior structure are both vital features for classifying objects. However, most of the existing methods consider exterior contour feature and internal structure feature separately, and thus fail to function when classifying patchy image structures that have similar contours and flexible structures. To address above limitations, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Orientation Region Transform (MORT), which can effectively characterize both contour and structure features simultaneously, for patchy image structure classification. MORT is performed over multiple orientation regions at multiple scales to effectively integrate patchy features, and thus enables a better description of the shape in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, the proposed MORT can be extended to combine with the deep convolutional neural network techniques, for further enhancement of classification accuracy. Very encouraging experimental results on the challenging ultra-fine-grained cultivar recognition task, insect wing recognition task, and large variation butterfly recognition task are obtained, which demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed MORT over the state-of-the-art methods in classifying patchy image structures. Our code and three patchy image structure datasets are available at: https://github.com/XiaohanYu-GU/MReT2019.\n",
      "Traffic sign identification using camera images from vehicles plays a critical role in autonomous driving and path planning. However, the front camera images can be distorted due to blurriness, lighting variations and vandalism which can lead to degradation of detection performances. As a solution, machine learning models must be trained with data from multiple domains, and collecting and labeling more data in each new domain is time consuming and expensive. In this work, we present an end-to-end framework to augment traffic sign training data using optimal reinforcement learning policies and a variety of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models, that can then be used to train traffic sign detector modules. Our automated augmenter enables learning from transformed nightime, poor lighting, and varying degrees of occlusions using the LISA Traffic Sign and BDD-Nexar dataset. The proposed method enables mapping training data from one domain to another, thereby improving traffic sign detection precision/recall from 0.70/0.66 to 0.83/0.71 for nighttime images.\n",
      "Recently, deep generative models have become increasingly popular in unsupervised anomaly detection. However, deep generative models aim at recovering the data distribution rather than detecting anomalies. Besides, deep generative models have the risk of overfitting training samples, which has disastrous effects on anomaly detection performance. To solve the above two problems, we propose a Self-adversarial Variational Autoencoder with a Gaussian anomaly prior assumption. We assume that both the anomalous and the normal prior distribution are Gaussian and have overlaps in the latent space. Therefore, a Gaussian transformer net T is trained to synthesize anomalous but near-normal latent variables. Keeping the original training objective of Variational Autoencoder, besides, the generator G tries to distinguish between the normal latent variables and the anomalous ones synthesized by T, and the encoder E is trained to discriminate whether the output of G is real. These new objectives we added not only give both G and E the ability to discriminate but also introduce additional regularization to prevent overfitting. Compared with the SOTA baselines, the proposed model achieves significant improvements in extensive experiments. Datasets and our model are available at a Github repository.\n",
      "The past few years have seen a dramatic rise of academic and societal interest in fair machine learning. While plenty of fair algorithms have been proposed recently to tackle this challenge for discrete variables, only a few ideas exist for continuous ones. The objective in this paper is to ensure some independence level between the outputs of regression models and any given continuous sensitive variables. For this purpose, we use the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\\'enyi (HGR) maximal correlation coefficient as a fairness metric. We propose two approaches to minimize the HGR coefficient. First, by reducing an upper bound of the HGR with a neural network estimation of the $\\chi^{2}$ divergence. Second, by minimizing the HGR directly with an adversarial neural network architecture. The idea is to predict the output Y while minimizing the ability of an adversarial neural network to find the estimated transformations which are required to predict the HGR coefficient. We empirically assess and compare our approaches and demonstrate significant improvements on previously presented work in the field.\n",
      "The advent of the Internet era has led to an explosive growth in the Electronic Health Records (EHR) in the past decades. The EHR data can be regarded as a collection of clinical events, including laboratory results, medication records, physiological indicators, etc, which can be used for clinical outcome prediction tasks to support constructions of intelligent health systems. Learning patient representation from these clinical events for the clinical outcome prediction is an important but challenging step. Most related studies transform EHR data of a patient into a sequence of clinical events in temporal order and then use sequential models to learn patient representations for outcome prediction. However, clinical event sequence contains thousands of event types and temporal dependencies. We further make an observation that clinical events occurring in a short period are not constrained by any temporal order but events in a long term are influenced by temporal dependencies. The multi-scale temporal property makes it difficult for traditional sequential models to capture the short-term co-occurrence and the long-term temporal dependencies in clinical event sequences. In response to the above challenges, this paper proposes a Multi-level Representation Model (MRM). MRM first uses a sparse attention mechanism to model the short-term co-occurrence, then uses interval-based event pooling to remove redundant information and reduce sequence length and finally predicts clinical outcomes through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Experiments on real-world datasets indicate that our proposed model largely improves the performance of clinical outcome prediction tasks using EHR data.\n",
      "We propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a simple but effective layer for synthesizing photorealistic images given an input semantic layout. Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization layers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. Finally, our model allows user control over both semantic and style. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE .\n",
      "A recent strategy to circumvent the exploding and vanishing gradient problem in RNNs, and to allow the stable propagation of signals over long time scales, is to constrain recurrent connectivity matrices to be orthogonal or unitary. This ensures eigenvalues with unit norm and thus stable dynamics and training. However this comes at the cost of reduced expressivity due to the limited variety of orthogonal transformations. We propose a novel connectivity structure based on the Schur decomposition and a splitting of the Schur form into normal and non-normal parts. This allows to parametrize matrices with unit-norm eigenspectra without orthogonality constraints on eigenbases. The resulting architecture ensures access to a larger space of spectrally constrained matrices, of which orthogonal matrices are a subset. This crucial difference retains the stability advantages and training speed of orthogonal RNNs while enhancing expressivity, especially on tasks that require computations over ongoing input sequences.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely adopted in various fields. However, existing GANs generally are not able to preserve the manifold of data space, mainly due to the simple representation of discriminator for the real/generated data. To address such open challenges, this paper proposes Manifold-preserved GANs (MaF-GANs), which generalize Wasserstein GANs into high-dimensional form. Specifically, to improve the representation of data, the discriminator in MaF-GANs is designed to map data into a high-dimensional manifold. Furthermore, to stabilize the training of MaF-GANs, an operation with precise and universal solution for any K-Lipschitz continuity, called Topological Consistency is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is justified by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. When adopting DCGAN as the backbone on CelebA (256*256), the proposed method achieved 12.43 FID, which outperforms the state-of-the-art model like Realness GAN (23.51 FID) by a large margin. Code will be made publicly available.\n",
      "Biphasic facial age translation aims at predicting the appearance of the input face at any age. Facial age translation has received considerable research attention in the last decade due to its practical value in cross-age face recognition and various entertainment applications. However, most existing methods model age changes between holistic images, regardless of the human face structure and the age-changing patterns of individual facial components. Consequently, the lack of semantic supervision will cause infidelity of generated faces in detail. To this end, we propose a unified framework for biphasic facial age translation with noisy-semantic guided generative adversarial networks. Structurally, we project the class-aware noisy semantic layouts to soft latent maps for the following injection operation on the individual facial parts. In particular, we introduce two sub-networks, ProjectionNet and ConstraintNet. ProjectionNet introduces the low-level structural semantic information with noise map and produces soft latent maps. ConstraintNet disentangles the high-level spatial features to constrain the soft latent maps, which endows more age-related context into the soft latent maps. Specifically, attention mechanism is employed in ConstraintNet for feature disentanglement. Meanwhile, in order to mine the strongest mapping ability of the network, we embed two types of learning strategies in the training procedure, supervised self-driven generation and unsupervised condition-driven cycle-consistent generation. As a result, extensive experiments conducted on MORPH and CACD datasets demonstrate the prominent ability of our proposed method which achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n",
      "Automated segmentation can assist radiotherapy treatment planning by saving manual contouring efforts and reducing intra-observer and inter-observer variations. The recent development of deep learning approaches has revoluted medical data processing, including semantic segmentation, by dramatically improving performance. However, training effective deep learning models usually require a large amount of high-quality labeled data, which are often costly to collect. We developed a novel semi-supervised adversarial deep learning approach for 3D pelvic CT image semantic segmentation. Unlike supervised deep learning methods, the new approach can utilize both annotated and un-annotated data for training. It generates un-annotated synthetic data by a data augmentation scheme using generative adversarial networks (GANs). We applied the new approach to segmenting multiple organs in male pelvic CT images, where CT images without annotations and GAN-synthesized un-annotated images were used in semi-supervised learning. Experimental results, evaluated by three metrics (Dice similarity coefficient, average Hausdorff distance, and average surface Hausdorff distance), showed that the new method achieved either comparable performance with substantially fewer annotated images or better performance with the same amount of annotated data, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Training robust supervised deep learning models for many geospatial applications of computer vision is difficult due to dearth of class-balanced and diverse training data. Conversely, obtaining enough training data for many applications is financially prohibitive or may be infeasible, especially when the application involves modeling rare or extreme events. Synthetically generating data (and labels) using a generative model that can sample from a target distribution and exploit the multi-scale nature of images can be an inexpensive solution to address scarcity of labeled data. Towards this goal, we present a deep conditional generative model, called VAE-Info-cGAN, that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a conditional Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN), for synthesizing semantically rich images simultaneously conditioned on a pixel-level condition (PLC) and a macroscopic feature-level condition (FLC). Dimensionally, the PLC can only vary in the channel dimension from the synthesized image and is meant to be a task-specific input. The FLC is modeled as an attribute vector in the latent space of the generated image which controls the contributions of various characteristic attributes germane to the target distribution. Experiments on a GPS trajectories dataset show that the proposed model can accurately generate various forms of spatiotemporal aggregates across different geographic locations while conditioned only on a raster representation of the road network. The primary intended application of the VAE-Info-cGAN is synthetic data (and label) generation for targeted data augmentation for computer vision-based modeling of problems relevant to geospatial analysis and remote sensing.\n",
      "With the increasing reliance on automated decision making, the issue of algorithmic fairness has gained increasing importance. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network for tabular data generation. The model includes two phases of training. In the first phase, the model is trained to accurately generate synthetic data similar to the reference dataset. In the second phase we modify the value function to add fairness constraint, and continue training the network to generate data that is both accurate and fair. We test our results in both cases of unconstrained, and constrained fair data generation. In the unconstrained case, i.e. when the model is only trained in the first phase and is only meant to generate accurate data following the same joint probability distribution of the real data, the results show that the model beats state-of-the-art GANs proposed in the literature to produce synthetic tabular data. Also, in the constrained case in which the first phase of training is followed by the second phase, we train the network and test it on four datasets studied in the fairness literature and compare our results with another state-of-the-art pre-processing method, and present the promising results that it achieves. Comparing to other studies utilizing GANs for fair data generation, our model is comparably more stable by using only one critic, and also by avoiding major problems of original GAN model, such as mode-dropping and non-convergence, by implementing a Wasserstein GAN.\n",
      "Approximating complex probability densities is a core problem in modern statistics. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Variational Inference (VI), a popular method in machine learning that uses optimization techniques to estimate complex probability densities. This property allows VI to converge faster than classical methods, such as, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Conceptually, VI works by choosing a family of probability density functions and then finding the one closest to the actual probability density -- often using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the optimization metric. We introduce the Evidence Lower Bound to tractably compute the approximated probability density and we review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference. Finally, we discuss the applications of VI to variational auto-encoders (VAE) and VAE-Generative Adversarial Network (VAE-GAN). With this paper, we aim to explain the concept of VI and assist in future research with this approach.\n",
      "We introduce FELICIA (FEderated LearnIng with a CentralIzed Adversary) a generative mechanism enabling collaborative learning. In particular, we show how a data owner with limited and biased data could benefit from other data owners while keeping data from all the sources private. This is a common scenario in medical image analysis where privacy legislation prevents data from being shared outside local premises. FELICIA works for a large family of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures including vanilla and conditional GANs as demonstrated in this work. We show that by using the FELICIA mechanism, a data owner with limited image samples can generate high-quality synthetic images with high utility while neither data owners has to provide access to its data. The sharing happens solely through a central discriminator that has access limited to synthetic data. Here, utility is defined as classification performance on a real test set. We demonstrate these benefits on several realistic healthcare scenarions using benchmark image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) as well as on medical images for the task of skin lesion classification. With multiple experiments, we show that even in the worst cases, combining FELICIA with real data gracefully achieves performance on par with real data while most results significantly improves the utility.\n",
      "Sketches are a medium to convey a visual scene from an individual's creative perspective. The addition of color substantially enhances the overall expressivity of a sketch. This paper proposes two methods to mimic human-drawn colored sketches by utilizing the Contour Drawing Dataset. Our first approach renders colored outline sketches by applying image processing techniques aided by k-means color clustering. The second method uses a generative adversarial network to develop a model that can generate colored sketches from previously unobserved images. We assess the results obtained through quantitative and qualitative evaluations.\n",
      "Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. Through a combination of advanced training techniques and neural network architectural components, it is now possible to create neural networks that can handle tabular data, images, text, and audio as both input and output. Deep learning allows a neural network to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is like the function of the human brain. This course will introduce the student to classic neural network structures, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU), General Adversarial Networks (GAN), and reinforcement learning. Application of these architectures to computer vision, time series, security, natural language processing (NLP), and data generation will be covered. High-Performance Computing (HPC) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged both on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Focus is primarily upon the application of deep learning to problems, with some introduction to mathematical foundations. Readers will use the Python programming language to implement deep learning using Google TensorFlow and Keras. It is not necessary to know Python prior to this book; however, familiarity with at least one programming language is assumed.\n",
      "We present a new method to create spatial data using a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our contribution uses coarse and widely available geospatial data to create maps of less available features at the finer scale in the built environment, bypassing their traditional acquisition techniques (e.g. satellite imagery or land surveying). In the work, we employ land use data and road networks as input to generate building footprints, and conduct experiments in 9 cities around the world. The method, which we implement in a tool we release openly, enables generating approximate maps of the urban form, and it is generalisable to augment other types of geoinformation, enhancing the completeness and quality of spatial data infrastructure. It may be especially useful in locations missing detailed and high-resolution data and those that are mapped with uncertain or heterogeneous quality, such as much of OpenStreetMap. The quality of the results is influenced by the urban form and scale. In most cases, experiments suggest promising performance as the method tends to truthfully indicate the locations, amount, and shape of buildings. The work has the potential to support several applications, such as energy, climate, and urban morphology studies in areas previously lacking required data.\n",
      "Class imbalance in a dataset is a major problem for classifiers that results in poor prediction with a high true positive rate (TPR) but a low true negative rate (TNR) for a majority positive training dataset. Generally, the pre-processing technique of oversampling of minority class(es) are used to overcome this deficiency. Our focus is on using the hybridization of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalanced problems. We propose a novel two-phase oversampling approach that has the synergy of SMOTE and GAN. The initial data of minority class(es) generated by SMOTE is further enhanced by GAN that produces better quality samples. We named it SMOTified-GAN as GAN works on pre-sampled minority data produced by SMOTE rather than randomly generating the samples itself. The experimental results prove the sample quality of minority class(es) has been improved in a variety of tested benchmark datasets. Its performance is improved by up to 9\\% from the next best algorithm tested on F1-score measurements. Its time complexity is also reasonable which is around $O(N^2d^2T)$ for a sequential algorithm.\n",
      "In recent years, with the advent of deep-learning, face recognition has achieved exceptional success. However, many of these deep face recognition models perform much better in handling frontal faces compared to profile faces. The major reason for poor performance in handling of profile faces is that it is inherently difficult to learn pose-invariant deep representations that are useful for profile face recognition. In this paper, we hypothesize that the profile face domain possesses a latent connection with the frontal face domain in a latent feature subspace. We look to exploit this latent connection by projecting the profile faces and frontal faces into a common latent subspace and perform verification or retrieval in the latent domain. We leverage a coupled conditional generative adversarial network (cpGAN) structure to find the hidden relationship between the profile and frontal images in a latent common embedding subspace. Specifically, the cpGAN framework consists of two conditional GAN-based sub-networks, one dedicated to the frontal domain and the other dedicated to the profile domain. Each sub-network tends to find a projection that maximizes the pair-wise correlation between the two feature domains in a common embedding feature subspace. The efficacy of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art is demonstrated using the CFP, CMU Multi-PIE, IJB-A, and IJB-C datasets. Additionally, we have also implemented a coupled convolutional neural network (cpCNN) and an adversarial discriminative domain adaptation network (ADDA) for profile to frontal face recognition. We have evaluated the performance of cpCNN and ADDA and compared it with the proposed cpGAN. Finally, we have also evaluated our cpGAN for reconstruction of frontal faces from input profile faces contained in the VGGFace2 dataset.\n",
      "The abundance of clouds, located both spatially and temporally, often makes remote sensing (RS) applications with optical images difficult or even impossible to perform. Traditional cloud removing techniques have been studied for years, and recently, Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches have also been considered. In this manuscript, a novel method for the restoration of clouds-corrupted optical images is presented, able to generate the whole optical scene of interest, not only the cloudy pixels, and based on a Joint Data Fusion paradigm, where three deep neural networks are hierarchically combined. Spatio-temporal features are separately extracted by a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and by a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and optical time-series of data respectively, and then combined with a U-shaped network. The use of time-series of data has been rarely explored in the state of the art for this peculiar objective, and moreover existing models do not combine both spatio-temporal domains and SAR-optical imagery. Quantitative and qualitative results have shown a good ability of the proposed method in producing cloud-free images, by also preserving the details and outperforming the cGAN and the ConvLSTM when individually used. Both the code and the dataset have been implemented from scratch and made available to interested researchers for further analysis and investigation.\n",
      "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) studies have grown exponentially in the past few years. Their impact has been seen mainly in the computer vision field with realistic image and video manipulation, especially generation, making significant advancements. While these computer vision advances have garnered much attention, GAN applications have diversified across disciplines such as time series and sequence generation. As a relatively new niche for GANs, fieldwork is ongoing to develop high quality, diverse and private time series data. In this paper, we review GAN variants designed for time series related applications. We propose a taxonomy of discrete-variant GANs and continuous-variant GANs, in which GANs deal with discrete time series and continuous time series data. Here we showcase the latest and most popular literature in this field; their architectures, results, and applications. We also provide a list of the most popular evaluation metrics and their suitability across applications. Also presented is a discussion of privacy measures for these GANs and further protections and directions for dealing with sensitive data. We aim to frame clearly and concisely the latest and state-of-the-art research in this area and their applications to real-world technologies.\n",
      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related dementia. It remains a challenge to identify the individuals at risk of dementia for precise management. Brain MRI offers a noninvasive biomarker to detect brain aging. Previous evidence shows that the brain structural change detected by diffusion MRI is associated with dementia. Mounting studies has conceptualised the brain as a complex network, which has shown the utility of this approach in characterising various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, the structural connectivity shows promise in dementia classification. The proposed BrainNetGAN is a generative adversarial network variant to augment the brain structural connectivity matrices for binary dementia classification tasks. Structural connectivity matrices between separated brain regions are constructed using tractography on diffusion MRI data. The BrainNetGAN model is trained to generate fake brain connectivity matrices, which are expected to reflect latent distribution of the real brain network data. Finally, a convolutional neural network classifier is proposed for binary dementia classification. Numerical results show that the binary classification performance in the testing set was improved using the BrainNetGAN augmented dataset. The proposed methodology allows quick synthesis of an arbitrary number of augmented connectivity matrices and can be easily transferred to similar classification tasks.\n",
      "Recent state-of-the-art active learning methods have mostly leveraged Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for sample acquisition; however, GAN is usually known to suffer from instability and sensitivity to hyper-parameters. In contrast to these methods, we propose in this paper a novel active learning framework that we call Maximum Classifier Discrepancy for Active Learning (MCDAL) which takes the prediction discrepancies between multiple classifiers. In particular, we utilize two auxiliary classification layers that learn tighter decision boundaries by maximizing the discrepancies among them. Intuitively, the discrepancies in the auxiliary classification layers' predictions indicate the uncertainty in the prediction. In this regard, we propose a novel method to leverage the classifier discrepancies for the acquisition function for active learning. We also provide an interpretation of our idea in relation to existing GAN based active learning methods and domain adaptation frameworks. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate the utility of our approach where the performance of our approach exceeds the state-of-the-art methods on several image classification and semantic segmentation datasets in active learning setups.\n",
      "We introduce the $\\gamma$-model, a predictive model of environment dynamics with an infinite probabilistic horizon. Replacing standard single-step models with $\\gamma$-models leads to generalizations of the procedures central to model-based control, including the model rollout and model-based value estimation. The $\\gamma$-model, trained with a generative reinterpretation of temporal difference learning, is a natural continuous analogue of the successor representation and a hybrid between model-free and model-based mechanisms. Like a value function, it contains information about the long-term future; like a standard predictive model, it is independent of task reward. We instantiate the $\\gamma$-model as both a generative adversarial network and normalizing flow, discuss how its training reflects an inescapable tradeoff between training-time and testing-time compounding errors, and empirically investigate its utility for prediction and control.\n",
      "Deep learning based visual to sound generation systems essentially need to be developed particularly considering the synchronicity aspects of visual and audio features with time. In this research we introduce a novel task of guiding a class conditioned generative adversarial network with the temporal visual information of a video input for visual to sound generation task adapting the synchronicity traits between audio-visual modalities. Our proposed FoleyGAN model is capable of conditioning action sequences of visual events leading towards generating visually aligned realistic sound tracks. We expand our previously proposed Automatic Foley dataset to train with FoleyGAN and evaluate our synthesized sound through human survey that shows noteworthy (on average 81\\%) audio-visual synchronicity performance. Our approach also outperforms in statistical experiments compared with other baseline models and audio-visual datasets.\n",
      "We observe that despite their hierarchical convolutional nature, the synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as, e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our results pave the way for generative models better suited for video and animation.\n",
      "Negative sampling, which samples negative triplets from non-observed ones in knowledge graph (KG), is an essential step in KG embedding. Recently, generative adversarial network (GAN), has been introduced in negative sampling. By sampling negative triplets with large gradients, these methods avoid the problem of vanishing gradient and thus obtain better performance. However, they make the original model more complex and harder to train. In this paper, motivated by the observation that negative triplets with large gradients are important but rare, we propose to directly keep track of them with the cache. In this way, our method acts as a \"distilled\" version of previous GAN-based methods, which does not waste training time on additional parameters to fit the full distribution of negative triplets. However, how to sample from and update the cache are two critical questions. We propose to solve these issues by automated machine learning techniques. The automated version also covers GAN-based methods as special cases. Theoretical explanation of NSCaching is also provided, justifying the superior over fixed sampling scheme. Besides, we further extend NSCaching with skip-gram model for graph embedding. Finally, extensive experiments show that our method can gain significant improvements on various KG embedding models and the skip-gram model, and outperforms the state-of-the-art negative sampling methods.\n",
      "Process mining algorithms discover a process model from an event log. The resulting process model is supposed to describe all possible event sequences of the underlying system. Generalization is a process model quality dimension of interest. A generalization metric should quantify the extent to which a process model represents the observed event sequences contained in the event log and the unobserved event sequences of the system. Most of the available metrics in the literature cannot properly quantify the generalization of a process model. A recently published method [1] called Adversarial System Variant Approximation leverages Generative Adversarial Networks to approximate the underlying event sequence distribution of a system from an event log. While this method demonstrated performance gains over existing methods in measuring the generalization of process models, its experimental evaluations have been performed under ideal conditions. This paper experimentally investigates the performance of Adversarial System Variant Approximation under non-ideal conditions such as biased and limited event logs. Moreover, experiments are performed to investigate the originally proposed sampling hyperparameter value of the method on its performance to measure the generalization. The results confirm the need to raise awareness about the working conditions of the Adversarial System Variant Approximation method. The outcomes of this paper also serve to initiate future research directions.

      "Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved stunning realism, fooling even human observers. Indeed, the popular tongue-in-cheek website {\\small \\url{ http://thispersondoesnotexist.com}}, taunts users with GAN generated images that seem too real to believe. On the other hand, GANs do leak information about their training data, as evidenced by membership attacks recently demonstrated in the literature. In this work, we challenge the assumption that GAN faces really are novel creations, by constructing a successful membership attack of a new kind. Unlike previous works, our attack can accurately discern samples sharing the same identity as training samples without being the same samples. We demonstrate the interest of our attack across several popular face datasets and GAN training procedures. Notably, we show that even in the presence of significant dataset diversity, an over represented person can pose a privacy concern.\n",
      "Many machine learning problems can be formulated as minimax problems such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AUC maximization and robust estimation, to mention but a few. A substantial amount of studies are devoted to studying the convergence behavior of their stochastic gradient-type algorithms. In contrast, there is relatively little work on their generalization, i.e., how the learning models built from training examples would behave on test examples. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive generalization analysis of stochastic gradient methods for minimax problems under both convex-concave and nonconvex-nonconcave cases through the lens of algorithmic stability. We establish a quantitative connection between stability and several generalization measures both in expectation and with high probability. For the convex-concave setting, our stability analysis shows that stochastic gradient descent ascent attains optimal generalization bounds for both smooth and nonsmooth minimax problems. We also establish generalization bounds for both weakly-convex-weakly-concave and gradient-dominated problems.\n",
      "Existing psychophysical studies have revealed that the cross-modal visual-tactile perception is common for humans performing daily activities. However, it is still challenging to build the algorithmic mapping from one modality space to another, namely the cross-modal visual-tactile data translation/generation, which could be potentially important for robotic operation. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for cross-modal visual-tactile data generation by leveraging the framework of the generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our approach takes the visual image of a material surface as the visual data, and the accelerometer signal induced by the pen-sliding movement on the surface as the tactile data. We adopt the conditional-GAN (cGAN) structure together with the residue-fusion (RF) module, and train the model with the additional feature-matching (FM) and perceptual losses to achieve the cross-modal data generation. The experimental results show that the inclusion of the RF module, and the FM and the perceptual losses significantly improves cross-modal data generation performance in terms of the classification accuracy upon the generated data and the visual similarity between the ground-truth and the generated data.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a new continuously learning generative model, called the Lifelong Twin Generative Adversarial Networks (LT-GANs). LT-GANs learns a sequence of tasks from several databases and its architecture consists of three components: two identical generators, namely the Teacher and Assistant, and one Discriminator. In order to allow for the LT-GANs to learn new concepts without forgetting, we introduce a new lifelong training approach, namely Lifelong Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (LAKD), which encourages the Teacher and Assistant to alternately teach each other, while learning a new database. This training approach favours transferring knowledge from a more knowledgeable player to another player which knows less information about a previously given task.\n",
      "A unique cognitive capability of humans consists in their ability to acquire new knowledge and skills from a sequence of experiences. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence systems are good at learning only the last given task without being able to remember the databases learnt in the past. We propose a novel lifelong learning methodology by employing a Teacher-Student network framework. While the Student module is trained with a new given database, the Teacher module would remind the Student about the information learnt in the past. The Teacher, implemented by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), is trained to preserve and replay past knowledge corresponding to the probabilistic representations of previously learn databases. Meanwhile, the Student module is implemented by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) which infers its latent variable representation from both the output of the Teacher module as well as from the newly available database. Moreover, the Student module is trained to capture both continuous and discrete underlying data representations across different domains. The proposed lifelong learning framework is applied in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised training.

      "Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) have demonstrated remarkable success due to their class-wise controllability and superior quality for complex generation tasks. Typical cGANs solve the joint distribution matching problem by decomposing two easier sub-problems: marginal matching and conditional matching. From our toy experiments, we found that it is the best to apply only conditional matching to certain samples due to the content-aware optimization of the discriminator. This paper proposes a simple (a few lines of code) but effective training methodology, selective focusing learning, which enforces the discriminator and generator to learn easy samples of each class rapidly while maintaining diversity. Our key idea is to selectively apply conditional and joint matching for the data in each mini-batch. We conducted experiments on recent cGAN variants in ImageNet (64x64 and 128x128), CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, and improved the performance significantly (up to 35.18% in terms of FID) without sacrificing diversity.\n",
      "Search-based procedural content generation methods have recently been introduced for the autonomous creation of bullet hell games. Search-based methods, however, can hardly model patterns of danmakus -- the bullet hell shooting entity -- explicitly and the resulting levels often look non-realistic. In this paper, we present a novel bullet hell game platform named Keiki, which allows the representation of danmakus as a parametric sequence which, in turn, can model the sequential behaviours of danmakus. We employ three types of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and test Keiki across three metrics designed to quantify the quality of the generated danmakus. The time-series GAN and periodic spatial GAN show different yet competitive performance in terms of the evaluation metrics adopted, their deviation from human-designed danmakus, and the diversity of generated danmakus. The preliminary experimental studies presented here showcase that potential of time-series GANs for sequential content generation in games.\n",
      "This paper reviews the current state of the art in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and applications in the context of the creative industries. A brief background of AI, and specifically Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is provided including Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We categorise creative applications into five groups related to how AI technologies are used: i) content creation, ii) information analysis, iii) content enhancement and post production workflows, iv) information extraction and enhancement, and v) data compression. We critically examine the successes and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these areas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and its potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near future, machine learning-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or collaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the successes of machine learning in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is the `creator', remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win awards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also limited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the context of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where its focus is human centric -- where it is designed to augment, rather than replace, human creativity.\n",
      "Convolutional neural network (CNN) have proven its success for semantic segmentation, which is a core task of emerging industrial applications such as autonomous driving. However, most progress in semantic segmentation of urban scenes is reported on standard scenarios, i.e., daytime scenes with favorable illumination conditions. In practical applications, the outdoor weather and illumination are changeable, e.g., cloudy and nighttime, which results in a significant drop of semantic segmentation accuracy of CNN only trained with daytime data. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (namely Mutual-GAN) to alleviate the accuracy decline when daytime-trained neural network is applied to videos captured under adverse weather conditions. The proposed Mutual-GAN adopts mutual information constraint to preserve image-objects during cross-weather adaptation, which is an unsolved problem for most unsupervised image-to-image translation approaches (e.g., CycleGAN). The proposed Mutual-GAN is evaluated on two publicly available driving video datasets (i.e., CamVid and SYNTHIA). The experimental results demonstrate that our Mutual-GAN can yield visually plausible translated images and significantly improve the semantic segmentation accuracy of daytime-trained deep learning network while processing videos under challenging weathers.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose an architecture to solve a novel problem statement that has stemmed more so in recent times with an increase in demand for virtual content delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All educational institutions, workplaces, research centers, etc. are trying to bridge the gap of communication during these socially distanced times with the use of online content delivery. The trend now is to create presentations, and then subsequently deliver the same using various virtual meeting platforms. The time being spent in such creation of presentations and delivering is what we try to reduce and eliminate through this paper which aims to use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules to automate the process of creating a slides-based presentation from a document, and then use state-of-the-art voice cloning models to deliver the content in the desired author's voice. We consider a structured document such as a research paper to be the content that has to be presented. The research paper is first summarized using BERT summarization techniques and condensed into bullet points that go into the slides. Tacotron inspired architecture with Encoder, Synthesizer, and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based vocoder, is used to convey the contents of the slides in the author's voice (or any customized voice). Almost all learning has now been shifted to online mode, and professionals are now working from the comfort of their homes. Due to the current situation, teachers and professionals have shifted to presentations to help them in imparting information. In this paper, we aim to reduce the considerable amount of time that is taken in creating a presentation by automating this process and subsequently delivering this presentation in a customized voice, using a content delivery mechanism that can clone any voice using a short audio clip.\n",
      "Generative adversary networks (GANs) suffer from training pathologies such as instability and mode collapse, which mainly arise from a lack of diversity in their adversarial interactions. Co-evolutionary GAN (CoE-GAN) training algorithms have shown to be resilient to these pathologies. This article introduces Mustangs, a spatially distributed CoE-GAN, which fosters diversity by using different loss functions during the training. Experimental analysis on MNIST and CelebA demonstrated that Mustangs trains statistically more accurate generators.\n",
      "Despite the accomplishments of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in modeling data distributions, training them remains a challenging task. A contributing factor to this difficulty is the non-intuitive nature of the GAN loss curves, which necessitates a subjective evaluation of the generated output to infer training progress. Recently, motivated by game theory, duality gap has been proposed as a domain agnostic measure to monitor GAN training. However, it is restricted to the setting when the GAN converges to a Nash equilibrium. But GANs need not always converge to a Nash equilibrium to model the data distribution. In this work, we extend the notion of duality gap to proximal duality gap that is applicable to the general context of training GANs where Nash equilibria may not exist. We show theoretically that the proximal duality gap is capable of monitoring the convergence of GANs to a wider spectrum of equilibria that subsumes Nash equilibria. We also theoretically establish the relationship between the proximal duality gap and the divergence between the real and generated data distributions for different GAN formulations. Our results provide new insights into the nature of GAN convergence. Finally, we validate experimentally the usefulness of proximal duality gap for monitoring and influencing GAN training.\n",
      "Novelty detection is the process of determining whether a query example differs from the learned training distribution. Previous methods attempt to learn the representation of the normal samples via generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, they will suffer from instability training, mode dropping, and low discriminative ability. Recently, various pretext tasks (e.g. rotation prediction and clustering) have been proposed for self-supervised learning in novelty detection. However, the learned latent features are still low discriminative. We overcome such problems by introducing a novel decoder-encoder framework. Firstly, a generative network (a.k.a. decoder) learns the representation by mapping the initialized latent vector to an image. In particular, this vector is initialized by considering the entire distribution of training data to avoid the problem of mode-dropping. Secondly, a contrastive network (a.k.a. encoder) aims to ``learn to compare'' through mutual information estimation, which directly helps the generative network to obtain a more discriminative representation by using a negative data augmentation strategy. Extensive experiments show that our model has significant superiority over cutting-edge novelty detectors and achieves new state-of-the-art results on some novelty detection benchmarks, e.g. CIFAR10 and DCASE. Moreover, our model is more stable for training in a non-adversarial manner, compared to other adversarial based novelty detection methods.\n",
      "Limited availability of labeled-data makes any supervised learning problem challenging. Alternative learning settings like semi-supervised and universum learning alleviate the dependency on labeled data, but still require a large amount of unlabeled data, which may be unavailable or expensive to acquire. GAN-based synthetic data generation methods have recently shown promise by generating synthetic samples to improve task at hand. However, these samples cannot be used for other purposes. In this paper, we propose a GAN game which provides improved discriminator accuracy under limited data settings, while generating realistic synthetic data. This provides the added advantage that now the generated data can be used for other similar tasks. We provide the theoretical guarantees and empirical results in support of our approach.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have swiftly evolved to imitate increasingly complex image distributions. However, majority of the developments focus on performance of GANs on balanced datasets. We find that the existing GANs and their training regimes which work well on balanced datasets fail to be effective in case of imbalanced (i.e. long-tailed) datasets. In this work we introduce a novel theoretically motivated Class Balancing regularizer for training GANs. Our regularizer makes use of the knowledge from a pre-trained classifier to ensure balanced learning of all the classes in the dataset. This is achieved via modelling the effective class frequency based on the exponential forgetting observed in neural networks and encouraging the GAN to focus on underrepresented classes. We demonstrate the utility of our regularizer in learning representations for long-tailed distributions via achieving better performance than existing approaches over multiple datasets. Specifically, when applied to an unconditional GAN, it improves the FID from $13.03$ to $9.01$ on the long-tailed iNaturalist-$2019$ dataset.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Network, as a promising research direction in the AI community, recently attracts considerable attention due to its ability to generating high-quality realistic data. GANs are a competing game between two neural networks trained in an adversarial manner to reach a Nash equilibrium. Despite the improvement accomplished in GANs in the last years, there remain several issues to solve. In this way, how to tackle these issues and make advances leads to rising research interests. This paper reviews literature that leverages the game theory in GANs and addresses how game models can relieve specific generative models' challenges and improve the GAN's performance. In particular, we firstly review some preliminaries, including the basic GAN model and some game theory backgrounds. After that, we present our taxonomy to summarize the state-of-the-art solutions into three significant categories: modified game model, modified architecture, and modified learning method. The classification is based on the modifications made in the basic model by the proposed approaches from the game-theoretic perspective. We further classify each category into several subcategories. Following the proposed taxonomy, we explore the main objective of each class and review the recent work in each group. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges in this field and present the potential future research topics.\n",
      "Face is one of the predominant means of person recognition. In the process of ageing, human face is prone to many factors such as time, attributes, weather and other subject specific variations. The impact of these factors were not well studied in the literature of face aging. In this paper, we propose a novel holistic model in this regard viz., ``Face Age progression With Attribute Manipulation (FAWAM)\", i.e. generating face images at different ages while simultaneously varying attributes and other subject specific characteristics. We address the task in a bottom-up manner, as two submodules i.e. face age progression and face attribute manipulation. For face aging, we use an attribute-conscious face aging model with a pyramidal generative adversarial network that can model age-specific facial changes while maintaining intrinsic subject specific characteristics. For facial attribute manipulation, the age processed facial image is manipulated with desired attributes while preserving other details unchanged, leveraging an attribute generative adversarial network architecture. We conduct extensive analysis in standard large scale datasets and our model achieves significant performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n",
      "Deep neural networks often lack the safety and robustness guarantees needed to be deployed in safety critical systems. Formal verification techniques can be used to prove input-output safety properties of networks, but when properties are difficult to specify, we rely on the solution to various optimization problems. In this work, we present an algorithm called ZoPE that solves optimization problems over the output of feedforward ReLU networks with low-dimensional inputs. The algorithm eagerly splits the input space, bounding the objective using zonotope propagation at each step, and improves computational efficiency compared to existing mixed integer programming approaches. We demonstrate how to formulate and solve three types of optimization problems: (i) minimization of any convex function over the output space, (ii) minimization of a convex function over the output of two networks in series with an adversarial perturbation in the layer between them, and (iii) maximization of the difference in output between two networks. Using ZoPE, we observe a $25\\times$ speedup on property 1 of the ACAS Xu neural network verification benchmark and an $85\\times$ speedup on a set of linear optimization problems. We demonstrate the versatility of the optimizer in analyzing networks by projecting onto the range of a generative adversarial network and visualizing the differences between a compressed and uncompressed network.\n",
      "Volumetric imaging by fluorescence microscopy is often limited by anisotropic spatial resolution from inferior axial resolution compared to the lateral resolution. To address this problem, here we present a deep-learning-enabled unsupervised super-resolution technique that enhances anisotropic images in volumetric fluorescence microscopy. In contrast to the existing deep learning approaches that require matched high-resolution target volume images, our method greatly reduces the effort to put into practice as the training of a network requires as little as a single 3D image stack, without a priori knowledge of the image formation process, registration of training data, or separate acquisition of target data. This is achieved based on the optimal transport driven cycle-consistent generative adversarial network that learns from an unpaired matching between high-resolution 2D images in lateral image plane and low-resolution 2D images in the other planes. Using fluorescence confocal microscopy and light-sheet microscopy, we demonstrate that the trained network not only enhances axial resolution, but also restores suppressed visual details between the imaging planes and removes imaging artifacts.\n",
      "This work tackles the problem of temporally coherent face anonymization in natural video streams.We propose JaGAN, a two-stage system starting with detecting and masking out faces with black image patches in all individual frames of the video. The second stage leverages a privacy-preserving Video Generative Adversarial Network designed to inpaint the missing image patches with artificially generated faces. Our initial experiments reveal that image based generative models are not capable of inpainting patches showing temporal coherent appearance across neighboring video frames. To address this issue we introduce a newly curated video collection, which is made publicly available for the research community along with this paper. We also introduce the Identity Invariance Score IdI as a means to quantify temporal coherency between neighboring frames.\n",
      "Uncertainty is ubiquitous with flow in subsurface rocks because of their inherent heterogeneity and lack of in-situ measurements. To complete uncertainty analysis in a multi-scale manner, it is a prerequisite to provide sufficient rock samples. Even though the advent of digital rock technology offers opportunities to reproduce rocks, it still cannot be utilized to provide massive samples due to its high cost, thus leading to the development of diversified mathematical methods. Among them, two-point statistics (TPS) and multi-point statistics (MPS) are commonly utilized, which feature incorporating low-order and high-order statistical information, respectively. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are becoming increasingly popular since they can reproduce training images with excellent visual and consequent geologic realism. However, standard GANs can only incorporate information from data, while leaving no interface for user-defined properties, and thus may limit the representativeness of reconstructed samples. In this study, we propose conditional GANs for digital rock reconstruction, aiming to reproduce samples not only similar to the real training data, but also satisfying user-specified properties. In fact, the proposed framework can realize the targets of MPS and TPS simultaneously by incorporating high-order information directly from rock images with the GANs scheme, while preserving low-order counterparts through conditioning. We conduct three reconstruction experiments, and the results demonstrate that rock type, rock porosity, and correlation length can be successfully conditioned to affect the reconstructed rock images. Furthermore, in contrast to existing GANs, the proposed conditioning enables learning of multiple rock types simultaneously, and thus invisibly saves computational cost.\n",
      "Training generative adversarial networks (GANs) with limited real image data generally results in deteriorated performance and collapsed models. To conquer this challenge, we are inspired by the latest observations, that one can discover independently trainable and highly sparse subnetworks (a.k.a., lottery tickets) from GANs. Treating this as an inductive prior, we suggest a brand-new angle towards data-efficient GAN training: by first identifying the lottery ticket from the original GAN using the small training set of real images; and then focusing on training that sparse subnetwork by re-using the same set. Both steps have lower complexity and are more data-efficient to train. We find our coordinated framework to offer orthogonal gains to existing real image data augmentation methods, and we additionally offer a new feature-level augmentation that can be applied together with them. Comprehensive experiments endorse the effectiveness of our proposed framework, across various GAN architectures (SNGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN-V2) and diverse datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet). Our training framework also displays powerful few-shot generalization ability, i.e., generating high-fidelity images by training from scratch with just 100 real images, without any pre-training.

We also provide a comparison of various GANs from the application point of view, its behaviour and implementation details. We propose a novel framework to identify candidate GANs for a specific use case based on architecture, loss, regularization and divergence. We also discuss application of the framework using an example, and we demonstrate a significant reduction in search space. This efficient way to determine potential GANs lowers unit economics of AI development for organizations.\n",
      "Neural networks are often used to process information from image-based sensors to produce control actions. While they are effective for this task, the complex nature of neural networks makes their output difficult to verify and predict, limiting their use in safety-critical systems. For this reason, recent work has focused on combining techniques in formal methods and reachability analysis to obtain guarantees on the closed-loop performance of neural network controllers. However, these techniques do not scale to the high-dimensional and complicated input space of image-based neural network controllers. In this work, we propose a method to address these challenges by training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to map states to plausible input images. By concatenating the generator network with the control network, we obtain a network with a low-dimensional input space. This insight allows us to use existing closed-loop verification tools to obtain formal guarantees on the performance of image-based controllers. We apply our approach to provide safety guarantees for an image-based neural network controller for an autonomous aircraft taxi problem. We guarantee that the controller will keep the aircraft on the runway and guide the aircraft towards the center of the runway. The guarantees we provide are with respect to the set of input images modeled by our generator network, so we provide a recall metric to evaluate how well the generator captures the space of plausible images.\n",
      "Recent years have witnessed unprecedented success achieved by deep learning models in the field of computer vision. However, their vulnerability towards carefully crafted adversarial examples has also attracted the increasing attention of researchers. Motivated by the observation that adversarial examples are due to the non-robust feature learned from the original dataset by models, we propose the concepts of salient feature(SF) and trivial feature(TF). The former represents the class-related feature, while the latter is usually adopted to mislead the model. We extract these two features with coupled generative adversarial network model and put forward a novel detection and defense method named salient feature extractor (SFE) to defend against adversarial attacks. Concretely, detection is realized by separating and comparing the difference between SF and TF of the input. At the same time, correct labels are obtained by re-identifying SF to reach the purpose of defense. Extensive experiments are carried out on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets where SFE shows state-of-the-art results in effectiveness and efficiency compared with baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretable understanding of the defense and detection process.\n",
      "Traditional deep neural networks (NNs) have significantly contributed to the state-of-the-art performance in the task of classification under various application domains. However, NNs have not considered inherent uncertainty in data associated with the class probabilities where misclassification under uncertainty may easily introduce high risk in decision making in real-world contexts (e.g., misclassification of objects in roads leads to serious accidents). Unlike Bayesian NN that indirectly infer uncertainty through weight uncertainties, evidential NNs (ENNs) have been recently proposed to explicitly model the uncertainty of class probabilities and use them for classification tasks. An ENN offers the formulation of the predictions of NNs as subjective opinions and learns the function by collecting an amount of evidence that can form the subjective opinions by a deterministic NN from data. However, the ENN is trained as a black box without explicitly considering inherent uncertainty in data with their different root causes, such as vacuity (i.e., uncertainty due to a lack of evidence) or dissonance (i.e., uncertainty due to conflicting evidence). By considering the multidimensional uncertainty, we proposed a novel uncertainty-aware evidential NN called WGAN-ENN (WENN) for solving an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. We took a hybrid approach that combines Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with ENNs to jointly train a model with prior knowledge of a certain class, which has high vacuity for OOD samples. Via extensive empirical experiments based on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrated that the estimation of uncertainty by WENN can significantly help distinguish OOD samples from boundary samples. WENN outperformed in OOD detection when compared with other competitive counterparts.\n",
      "Unsupervised domain adaptation seeks to mitigate the distribution discrepancy between source and target domains, given labeled samples of the source domain and unlabeled samples of the target domain. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant improvement in domain adaptation by producing images which are domain specific for training. However, most of the existing GAN based techniques for unsupervised domain adaptation do not consider semantic information during domain matching, hence these methods degrade the performance when the source and target domain data are semantically different. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end novel semantic consistent generative adversarial network (SCGAN). This network can achieve source to target domain matching by capturing semantic information at the feature level and producing images for unsupervised domain adaptation from both the source and the target domains. We demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method which exceeds the state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised domain adaptation settings by performing experiments on digit and object classification tasks.\n",
      "Meta Reinforcement Learning (MRL) enables an agent to learn from a limited number of past trajectories and extrapolate to a new task. In this paper, we attempt to improve the robustness of MRL. We build upon model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and propose a novel method to generate adversarial samples for MRL by using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). That allows us to enhance the robustness of MRL to adversal attacks by leveraging these attacks during meta training process.\n",
      "Document image enhancement and binarization methods are often used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of document image analysis tasks such as text recognition. Traditional non-machine-learning methods are constructed on low-level features in an unsupervised manner but have difficulty with binarization on documents with severely degraded backgrounds. Convolutional neural network-based methods focus only on grayscale images and on local textual features. In this paper, we propose a two-stage color document image enhancement and binarization method using generative adversarial neural networks. In the first stage, four color-independent adversarial networks are trained to extract color foreground information from an input image for document image enhancement. In the second stage, two independent adversarial networks with global and local features are trained for image binarization of documents of variable size. For the adversarial neural networks, we formulate loss functions between a discriminator and generators having an encoder-decoder structure. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than many classical and state-of-the-art algorithms over the Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) datasets, the LRDE Document Binarization Dataset (LRDE DBD), and our shipping label image dataset. We plan to release the shipping label dataset as well as our implementation code at github.com/opensuh/DocumentBinarization/.\n",
      "Current deep learning models for classification tasks in computer vision are trained using mini-batches. In the present article, we take advantage of the relationships between samples in a mini-batch, using graph neural networks to aggregate information from similar images. This helps mitigate the adverse effects of alterations to the input images on classification performance. Diverse experiments on image-based object and scene classification show that this approach not only improves a classifier's performance but also increases its robustness to image perturbations and adversarial attacks. Further, we also show that mini-batch graph neural networks can help to alleviate the problem of mode collapse in Generative Adversarial Networks.\n",
      "Synthetic data generation becomes prevalent as a solution to privacy leakage and data shortage. Generative models are designed to generate a realistic synthetic dataset, which can precisely express the data distribution for the real dataset. The generative adversarial networks (GAN), which gain great success in the computer vision fields, are doubtlessly used for synthetic data generation. Though there are prior works that have demonstrated great progress, most of them learn the correlations in the data distributions rather than the true processes in which the datasets are naturally generated. Correlation is not reliable for it is a statistical technique that only tells linear dependencies and is easily affected by the dataset's bias. Causality, which encodes all underlying factors of how the real data be naturally generated, is more reliable than correlation. In this work, we propose a causal model named Causal Tabular Generative Neural Network (Causal-TGAN) to generate synthetic tabular data using the tabular data's causal information. Extensive experiments on both simulated datasets and real datasets demonstrate the better performance of our method when given the true causal graph and a comparable performance when using the estimated causal graph.\n",
      "With the fast growing demand on new services and applications as well as the increasing awareness of data protection, traditional centralized traffic classification approaches are facing unprecedented challenges. This paper introduces a novel framework, Federated Generative Adversarial Networks and Automatic Classification (FGAN-AC), which integrates decentralized data synthesizing with traffic classification. FGAN-AC is able to synthesize and classify multiple types of service data traffic from decentralized local datasets without requiring a large volume of manually labeled dataset or causing any data leakage. Two types of data synthesizing approaches have been proposed and compared: computation-efficient FGAN (FGAN-\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral1}) and communication-efficient FGAN (FGAN-\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral2}). The former only implements a single CNN model for processing each local dataset and the later only requires coordination of intermediate model training parameters. An automatic data classification and model updating framework has been proposed to automatically identify unknown traffic from the synthesized data samples and create new pseudo-labels for model training. Numerical results show that our proposed framework has the ability to synthesize highly mixed service data traffic and can significantly improve the traffic classification performance compared to existing solutions.\n",
      "The quality of generative models (such as Generative adversarial networks and Variational Auto-Encoders) depends heavily on the choice of a good probability distance. However some popular metrics like the Wasserstein or the Sliced Wasserstein distances, the Jensen-Shannon divergence, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, lack convenient properties such as (geodesic) convexity, fast evaluation and so on. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a class of distances that have built-in convexity. We investigate the relationship with some known paradigms (sliced distances - a synonym for Radon distances -, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, energy distances). The distances are shown to possess fast implementations and are included in an adapted Variational Auto-Encoder termed Radon Sobolev Variational Auto-Encoder (RS-VAE) which produces high quality results on standard generative datasets.   Keywords: Variational Auto-Encoder; Generative model; Sobolev spaces; Radon Sobolev Variational Auto-Encoder;\n",
      "This paper introduces a conditional generative adversarial network to redesign a street-level image of urban scenes by generating 1) an urban intervention policy, 2) an attention map that localises where intervention is needed, 3) a high-resolution street-level image (1024 X 1024 or 1536 X1536) after implementing the intervention. We also introduce a new dataset that comprises aligned street-level images of before and after urban interventions from real-life scenarios that make this research possible. The introduced method has been trained on different ranges of urban interventions applied to realistic images. The trained model shows strong performance in re-modelling cities, outperforming existing methods that apply image-to-image translation in other domains that is computed in a single GPU. This research opens the door for machine intelligence to play a role in re-thinking and re-designing the different attributes of cities based on adversarial learning, going beyond the mainstream of facial landmarks manipulation or image synthesis from semantic segmentation.\n",
      "Continual learning usually assumes the incoming data are fully labeled, which might not be applicable in real applications. In this work, we consider semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) that incrementally learns from partially labeled data. Observing that existing continual learning methods lack the ability to continually exploit the unlabeled data, we propose deep Online Replay with Discriminator Consistency (ORDisCo) to interdependently learn a classifier with a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN), which continually passes the learned data distribution to the classifier. In particular, ORDisCo replays data sampled from the conditional generator to the classifier in an online manner, exploiting unlabeled data in a time- and storage-efficient way. Further, to explicitly overcome the catastrophic forgetting of unlabeled data, we selectively stabilize parameters of the discriminator that are important for discriminating the pairs of old unlabeled data and their pseudo-labels predicted by the classifier. We extensively evaluate ORDisCo on various semi-supervised learning benchmark datasets for SSCL, and show that ORDisCo achieves significant performance improvement on SVHN, CIFAR10 and Tiny-ImageNet, compared to strong baselines.\n",
      "We propose a general purpose approach to detect landmarks with improved temporal consistency, and personalization. Most sparse landmark detection methods rely on laborious, manually labelled landmarks, where inconsistency in annotations over a temporal volume leads to sub-optimal landmark learning. Further, high-quality landmarks with personalization is often hard to achieve. We pose landmark detection as an image translation problem. We capture two sets of unpaired marked (with paint) and unmarked videos. We then use a generative adversarial network and cyclic consistency to predict deformations of landmark templates that simulate markers on unmarked images until these images are indistinguishable from ground-truth marked images. Our novel method does not rely on manually labelled priors, is temporally consistent, and image class agnostic -- face, and hand landmarks detection examples are shown.\n",
      "At present, SOILD-STATE Fermentation (SSF) is mainly controlled by artificial experience, and the product quality and yield are not stable. Accurately predicting the quality and yield of SSF is of great significance for improving human food security and supply. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Utility Prediction (IUP) scheme for SSF in 5G Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), including parameter collection and utility prediction of SSF process. This IUP scheme is based on the environmental perception and intelligent learning algorithms of the 5G Industrial IoT. We build a workflow model based on rewritable petri net to verify the correctness of the system model function and process. In addition, we design a utility prediction model for SSF based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). We design a GAN with constraint of mean square error (MSE-GAN) to solve the problem of few-shot learning of SSF, and then combine with the FCNN to realize the utility prediction (usually use the alcohol) of SSF. Based on the production of liquor in laboratory, the experiments show that the proposed method is more accurate than the other prediction methods in the utility prediction of SSF, and provide the basis for the numerical analysis of the proportion of preconfigured raw materials and the appropriate setting of cellar temperature.\n",
      "Chromosome karyotype analysis is of great clinical importance in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, especially for genetic diseases. Since manual analysis is highly time and effort consuming, computer-assisted automatic chromosome karyotype analysis based on images is routinely used to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the analysis. Due to the strip shape of the chromosomes, they easily get overlapped with each other when imaged, significantly affecting the accuracy of the analysis afterward. Conventional overlapping chromosome segmentation methods are usually based on manually tagged features, hence, the performance of which is easily affected by the quality, such as resolution and brightness, of the images. To address the problem, in this paper, we present an adversarial multiscale feature learning framework to improve the accuracy and adaptability of overlapping chromosome segmentation. Specifically, we first adopt the nested U-shape network with dense skip connections as the generator to explore the optimal representation of the chromosome images by exploiting multiscale features. Then we use the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to generate images similar to the original ones, the training stability of which is enhanced by applying the least-square GAN objective. Finally, we employ Lovasz-Softmax to help the model converge in a continuous optimization setting. Comparing with the established algorithms, the performance of our framework is proven superior by using public datasets in eight evaluation criteria, showing its great potential in overlapping chromosome segmentation\n",
      "Measuring biases of vision systems with respect to protected attributes like gender and age is critical as these systems gain widespread use in society. However, significant correlations between attributes in benchmark datasets make it difficult to separate algorithmic bias from dataset bias. To mitigate such attribute confounding during bias analysis, we propose a matching approach that selects a subset of images from the full dataset with balanced attribute distributions across protected attributes. Our matching approach first projects real images onto a generative adversarial network (GAN)'s latent space in a manner that preserves semantic attributes. It then finds image matches in this latent space across a chosen protected attribute, yielding a dataset where semantic and perceptual attributes are balanced across the protected attribute. We validate projection and matching strategies with qualitative, quantitative, and human annotation experiments. We demonstrate our work in the context of gender bias in multiple open-source facial-recognition classifiers and find that bias persists after removing key confounders via matching. Code and documentation to reproduce the results here and apply the methods to new data is available at https://github.com/csinva/matching-with-gans .\n",
      "The analysis of the compression effects in generative adversarial networks (GANs) after training, i.e. without any fine-tuning, remains an unstudied, albeit important, topic with the increasing trend of their computation and memory requirements. While existing works discuss the difficulty of compressing GANs during training, requiring novel methods designed with the instability of GANs training in mind, we show that existing compression methods (namely clipping and quantization) may be directly applied to compress GANs post-training, without any additional changes. High compression levels may distort the generated set, likely leading to an increase of outliers that may negatively affect the overall assessment of existing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) based metrics. We propose two new precision and recall metrics based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), which, on top of increasing the outlier robustness, decrease the complexity of assessing an evaluation sample against $n$ reference samples from $O(n)$ to $O(\\log(n))$, if using LSH and KNN, and to $O(1)$, if only applying LSH. We show that low-bit compression of several pre-trained GANs on multiple datasets induces a trade-off between precision and recall, retaining sample quality while sacrificing sample diversity.\n",
      "In this paper, a new method of training pipeline is discussed to achieve significant performance on the task of anti-spoofing with RGB image. We explore and highlight the impact of using pseudo-depth to pre-train a network that will be used as the backbone to the final classifier. While the usage of pseudo-depth for anti-spoofing task is not a new idea on its own, previous endeavours utilize pseudo-depth simply as another medium to extract features for performing prediction, or as part of many auxiliary losses in aiding the training of the main classifier, normalizing the importance of pseudo-depth as just another semantic information. Through this work, we argue that there exists a significant advantage in training the final classifier can be gained by the pre-trained generator learning to predict the corresponding pseudo-depth of a given facial image, from a Generative Adversarial Network framework. Our experimental results indicate that our method results in a much more adaptable system that can generalize beyond intra-dataset samples, but to inter-dataset samples, which it has never seen before during training. Quantitatively, our method approaches the baseline performance of the current state of the art anti-spoofing models with 15.8x less parameters used. Moreover, experiments showed that the introduced methodology performs well only using basic binary label without additional semantic information which indicates potential benefits of this work in industrial and application based environment where trade-off between additional labelling and resources are considered.\n",
      "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, but the continuously growing scale of models makes them challenging to deploy widely in practical applications. In particular, for real-time generation tasks, different devices require generators of different sizes due to varying computing power. In this paper, we introduce slimmable GANs (SlimGANs), which can flexibly switch the width of the generator to accommodate various quality-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Specifically, we leverage multiple discriminators that share partial parameters to train the slimmable generator. To facilitate the \\textit{consistency} between generators of different widths, we present a stepwise inplace distillation technique that encourages narrow generators to learn from wide ones. As for class-conditional generation, we propose a sliceable conditional batch normalization that incorporates the label information into different widths. Our methods are validated, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by extensive experiments and a detailed ablation study.\n",
      "Mitigating the risk arising from extreme events is a fundamental goal with many applications, such as the modelling of natural disasters, financial crashes, epidemics, and many others. To manage this risk, a vital step is to be able to understand or generate a wide range of extreme scenarios. Existing approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at generating realistic samples, but seek to generate typical samples, rather than extreme samples. Hence, in this work, we propose ExGAN, a GAN-based approach to generate realistic and extreme samples. To model the extremes of the training distribution in a principled way, our work draws from Extreme Value Theory (EVT), a probabilistic approach for modelling the extreme tails of distributions. For practical utility, our framework allows the user to specify both the desired extremeness measure, as well as the desired extremeness probability they wish to sample at. Experiments on real US Precipitation data show that our method generates realistic samples, based on visual inspection and quantitative measures, in an efficient manner. Moreover, generating increasingly extreme examples using ExGAN can be done in constant time (with respect to the extremeness probability $\\tau$), as opposed to the $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\tau})$ time required by the baseline approach.\n",
      "Disentanglement is defined as the problem of learninga representation that can separate the distinct, informativefactors of variations of data. Learning such a representa-tion may be critical for developing explainable and human-controllable Deep Generative Models (DGMs) in artificialintelligence. However, disentanglement in GANs is not a triv-ial task, as the absence of sample likelihood and posteriorinference for latent variables seems to prohibit the forwardstep. Inspired by contrastive learning (CL), this paper, froma new perspective, proposes contrastive disentanglement ingenerative adversarial networks (CD-GAN). It aims at dis-entangling the factors of inter-class variation of visual datathrough contrasting image features, since the same factorvalues produce images in the same class. More importantly,we probe a novel way to make use of limited amount ofsupervision to the largest extent, to promote inter-class dis-entanglement performance. Extensive experimental resultson many well-known datasets demonstrate the efficacy ofCD-GAN for disentangling inter-class variation.\n",
      "In medical imaging, chromosome straightening plays a significant role in the pathological study of chromosomes and in the development of cytogenetic maps. Whereas different approaches exist for the straightening task, they are mostly geometric algorithms whose outputs are characterized by jagged edges or fragments with discontinued banding patterns. To address the flaws in the geometric algorithms, we propose a novel framework based on image-to-image translation to learn a pertinent mapping dependence for synthesizing straightened chromosomes with uninterrupted banding patterns and preserved details. In addition, to avoid the pitfall of deficient input chromosomes, we construct an augmented dataset using only one single curved chromosome image for training models. Based on this framework, we apply two popular image-to-image translation architectures, U-shape networks and conditional generative adversarial networks, to assess its efficacy. Experiments on a dataset comprising of 642 real-world chromosomes demonstrate the superiority of our framework as compared to the geometric method in straightening performance by rendering realistic and continued chromosome details. Furthermore, our straightened results improve the chromosome classification, achieving 0.98%-1.39% in mean accuracy.\n",
      "We propose a novel defensive mechanism based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to defend against adversarial attacks in end-to-end communications systems. Specifically, we utilize a generative network to model a powerful adversary and enable the end-to-end communications system to combat the generative attack network via a minimax game. We show that the proposed system not only works well against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks but also possesses excellent generalization capabilities to maintain good performance under no attacks. We also show that our GAN-based end-to-end system outperforms the conventional communications system and the end-to-end communications system with/without adversarial training.\n",
      "Sketching or doodling is a popular creative activity that people engage in. However, most existing work in automatic sketch understanding or generation has focused on sketches that are quite mundane. In this work, we introduce two datasets of creative sketches -- Creative Birds and Creative Creatures -- containing 10k sketches each along with part annotations. We propose DoodlerGAN -- a part-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) -- to generate unseen compositions of novel part appearances. Quantitative evaluations as well as human studies demonstrate that sketches generated by our approach are more creative and of higher quality than existing approaches. In fact, in Creative Birds, subjects prefer sketches generated by DoodlerGAN over those drawn by humans!

      "Normalization techniques have become a basic component in modern convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). In particular, many recent works demonstrate that promoting the orthogonality of the weights helps train deep models and improve robustness. For ConvNets, most existing methods are based on penalizing or normalizing weight matrices derived from concatenating or flattening the convolutional kernels. These methods often destroy or ignore the benign convolutional structure of the kernels; therefore, they are often expensive or impractical for deep ConvNets. In contrast, we introduce a simple and efficient ``convolutional normalization'' method that can fully exploit the convolutional structure in the Fourier domain and serve as a simple plug-and-play module to be conveniently incorporated into any ConvNets. Our method is inspired by recent work on preconditioning methods for convolutional sparse coding and can effectively promote each layer's channel-wise isometry. Furthermore, we show that convolutional normalization can reduce the layerwise spectral norm of the weight matrices and hence improve the Lipschitzness of the network, leading to easier training and improved robustness for deep ConvNets. Applied to classification under noise corruptions and generative adversarial network (GAN), we show that convolutional normalization improves the robustness of common ConvNets such as ResNet and the performance of GAN. We verify our findings via extensive numerical experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.\n",
      "Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) is an emerging research that aims to solve the classification problems with very few training data. The present works on ZSL mainly focus on the mapping of learning semantic space to visual space. It encounters many challenges that obstruct the progress of ZSL research. First, the representation of the semantic feature is inadequate to represent all features of the categories. Second, the domain drift problem still exists during the transfer from semantic space to visual space. In this paper, we introduce knowledge sharing (KS) to enrich the representation of semantic features. Based on KS, we apply a generative adversarial network to generate pseudo visual features from semantic features that are very close to the real visual features. Abundant experimental results from two benchmark datasets of ZSL show that the proposed approach has a consistent improvement.\n",
      "From generating never-before-seen images to domain adaptation, applications of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) spread wide in the domain of vision and graphics problems. With the remarkable ability of GANs in learning the distribution and generating images of a particular class, they can be used for semi-supervised classification tasks. However, the problem is that if two classes of images share similar characteristics, the GAN might learn to generalize and hinder the classification of the two classes. In this paper, we use various images from MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets to illustrate how similar images cause the GAN to generalize, leading to the poor classification of images. We propose a modification to the traditional training of GANs that allows for improved multi-class classification in similar classes of images in a semi-supervised learning framework.\n",
      "We introduce a new method for training generative adversarial networks by applying the Wasserstein-2 metric proximal on the generators. The approach is based on Wasserstein information geometry. It defines a parametrization invariant natural gradient by pulling back optimal transport structures from probability space to parameter space. We obtain easy-to-implement iterative regularizers for the parameter updates of implicit deep generative models. Our experiments demonstrate that this method improves the speed and stability of training in terms of wall-clock time and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance.\n",
      "Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated their potential in federated learning, i.e., learning a centralized model from data privately hosted by multiple sites. A federatedGAN jointly trains a centralized generator and multiple private discriminators hosted at different sites. A major theoretical challenge for the federated GAN is the heterogeneity of the local data distributions. Traditional approaches cannot guarantee to learn the target distribution, which isa mixture of the highly different local distributions. This paper tackles this theoretical challenge, and for the first time, provides a provably correct framework for federated GAN. We propose a new approach called Universal Aggregation, which simulates a centralized discriminator via carefully aggregating the mixture of all private discriminators. We prove that a generator trained with this simulated centralized discriminator can learn the desired target distribution. Through synthetic and real datasets, we show that our method can learn the mixture of largely different distributions where existing federated GAN methods fail.\n",
      "We propose a framework for generating samples from a probability distribution that differs from the probability distribution of the training set. We use an adversarial process that simultaneously trains three networks, a generator and two discriminators. We refer to this new model as regularized generative adversarial network (RegGAN). We evaluate RegGAN on a synthetic dataset composed of gray scale images and we further show that it can be used to learn some pre-specified notions in topology (basic topology properties). The work is motivated by practical problems encountered while using generative methods in the art world.\n",
      "Despite growing insights into the GAN training, it still suffers from instability during the training procedure. To alleviate this problem, this paper presents a novel convolutional layer, called perturbed-convolution (PConv), which focuses on achieving two goals simultaneously: penalize the discriminator for training GAN stably and prevent the overfitting problem in the discriminator. PConv generates perturbed features by randomly disturbing an input tensor before performing the convolution operation. This approach is simple but surprisingly effective. First, to reliably classify real and generated samples using the disturbed input tensor, the intermediate layers in the discriminator should learn features having a small local Lipschitz value. Second, due to the perturbed features in PConv, the discriminator is difficult to memorize the real images; this makes the discriminator avoid the overfitting problem. To show the generalization ability of the proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments with various loss functions and datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN, and tiny-ImageNet. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that WCL significantly improves the performance of GAN and conditional GAN in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID). For instance, the proposed method improves FID scores on the tiny-ImageNet dataset from 58.59 to 50.42.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are capable of generating convincing imitations of elements from a training set, but the distribution of elements in the training set affects to difficulty of properly training the GAN and the quality of the outputs it produces. This paper looks at six different GANs trained on different subsets of data from the game Lode Runner. The quality diversity algorithm MAP-Elites was used to explore the set of quality levels that could be produced by each GAN, where quality was defined as being beatable and having the longest solution path possible. Interestingly, a GAN trained on only 20 levels generated the largest set of diverse beatable levels while a GAN trained on 150 levels generated the smallest set of diverse beatable levels, thus challenging the notion that more is always better when training GANs.\n",
      "This study develops a neural network-based approach for emulating high-resolution modeled precipitation data with comparable statistical properties but at greatly reduced computational cost. The key idea is to use combination of low- and high- resolution simulations to train a neural network to map from the former to the latter. Specifically, we define two types of CNNs, one that stacks variables directly and one that encodes each variable before stacking, and we train each CNN type both with a conventional loss function, such as mean square error (MSE), and with a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), for a total of four CNN variants. We compare the four new CNN-derived high-resolution precipitation results with precipitation generated from original high resolution simulations, a bilinear interpolater and the state-of-the-art CNN-based super-resolution (SR) technique. Results show that the SR technique produces results similar to those of the bilinear interpolator with smoother spatial and temporal distributions and smaller data variabilities and extremes than the original high resolution simulations. While the new CNNs trained by MSE generate better results over some regions than the interpolator and SR technique do, their predictions are still not as close as the original high resolution simulations. The CNNs trained by CGAN generate more realistic and physically reasonable results, better capturing not only data variability in time and space but also extremes such as intense and long-lasting storms. The new proposed CNN-based downscaling approach can downscale precipitation from 50~km to 12~km in 14~min for 30~years once the network is trained (training takes 4~hours using 1~GPU), while the conventional dynamical downscaling would take 1~month using 600 CPU cores to generate simulations at the resolution of 12~km over contiguous United States.\n",
      "We propose a method to optimize the representation and distinguishability of samples from two probability distributions, by maximizing the estimated power of a statistical test based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). This optimized MMD is applied to the setting of unsupervised learning by generative adversarial networks (GAN), in which a model attempts to generate realistic samples, and a discriminator attempts to tell these apart from data samples. In this context, the MMD may be used in two roles: first, as a discriminator, either directly on the samples, or on features of the samples. Second, the MMD can be used to evaluate the performance of a generative model, by testing the model's samples against a reference data set. In the latter role, the optimized MMD is particularly helpful, as it gives an interpretable indication of how the model and data distributions differ, even in cases where individual model samples are not easily distinguished either by eye or by classifier.\n",

With thirteen datasets covering a wide variety of image domains (The datasets and code are available at: https://github.com/odegeasslbc/FastGAN-pytorch), we show our model's superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art StyleGAN2, when data and computing budget are limited.\n",
      "For health prognostic task, ever-increasing efforts have been focused on machine learning-based methods, which are capable of yielding accurate remaining useful life (RUL) estimation for industrial equipment or components without exploring the degradation mechanism. A prerequisite ensuring the success of these methods depends on a wealth of run-to-failure data, however, run-to-failure data may be insufficient in practice. That is, conducting a substantial amount of destructive experiments not only is high costs, but also may cause catastrophic consequences. Out of this consideration, an enhanced RUL framework focusing on data self-generation is put forward for both non-cyclic and cyclic degradation patterns for the first time. It is designed to enrich data from a data-driven way, generating realistic-like time-series to enhance current RUL methods. First, high-quality data generation is ensured through the proposed convolutional recurrent generative adversarial network (CR-GAN), which adopts a two-channel fusion convolutional recurrent neural network. Next, a hierarchical framework is proposed to combine generated data into current RUL estimation methods. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is verified through both non-cyclic and cyclic degradation systems. With the enhanced RUL framework, an aero-engine system following non-cyclic degradation has been tested using three typical RUL models. State-of-art RUL estimation results are achieved by enhancing capsule network with generated time-series. Specifically, estimation errors evaluated by the index score function have been reduced by 21.77%, and 32.67% for the two employed operating conditions, respectively. Besides, the estimation error is reduced to zero for the Lithium-ion battery system, which presents cyclic degradation.\n",
      "The generation of stylish Chinese fonts is an important problem involved in many applications. Most of existing generation methods are based on the deep generative models, particularly, the generative adversarial networks (GAN) based models. However, these deep generative models may suffer from the mode collapse issue, which significantly degrades the diversity and quality of generated results. In this paper, we introduce a one-bit stroke encoding to capture the key mode information of Chinese characters and then incorporate it into CycleGAN, a popular deep generative model for Chinese font generation. As a result we propose an efficient method called StrokeGAN, mainly motivated by the observation that the stroke encoding contains amount of mode information of Chinese characters. In order to reconstruct the one-bit stroke encoding of the associated generated characters, we introduce a stroke-encoding reconstruction loss imposed on the discriminator. Equipped with such one-bit stroke encoding and stroke-encoding reconstruction loss, the mode collapse issue of CycleGAN can be significantly alleviated, with an improved preservation of strokes and diversity of generated characters. The effectiveness of StrokeGAN is demonstrated by a series of generation tasks over nine datasets with different fonts. The numerical results demonstrate that StrokeGAN generally outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of content and recognition accuracies, as well as certain stroke error, and also generates more realistic characters.\n"

To tackle this challenge, we develop a differentially private framework for synthetic data generation using R\\'enyi differential privacy. Our approach builds on convolutional autoencoders and convolutional generative adversarial networks to preserve some of the critical characteristics of the generated synthetic data.

Deep learning methods have been deployed to predict the spread of misinformation. While achieving the state-of-the-art predictive performance, deep learning methods lack the interpretability due to their blackbox nature. To remedy this gap, this study proposes a novel interpretable deep learning approach, Generative Adversarial Network based Piecewise Wide and Attention Deep Learning (GAN-PiWAD), to predict health misinformation transmission in social media. Improving upon state-of-the-art interpretable methods, GAN-PiWAD captures the interactions among multi-modal data, offers unbiased estimation of the total effect of each feature, and models the dynamic total effect of each feature when its value varies. We select features according to social exchange theory and evaluate GAN-PiWAD on 4,445 misinformation videos. The proposed approach outperformed strong benchmarks. Interpretation of GAN-PiWAD indicates video description, negative video content, and channel credibility are key features that drive viral transmission of misinformation. This study contributes to IS with a novel interpretable deep learning method that is generalizable to understand other human decision factors. Our findings provide direct implications for social media platforms and policymakers to design proactive interventions to identify misinformation, control transmissions, and manage infodemics.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are able to learn mappings between simple, relatively low-dimensional, random distributions and points on the manifold of realistic images in image-space. The semantics of this mapping, however, are typically entangled such that meaningful image properties cannot be controlled independently of one another. Conditional GANs (cGANs) provide a potential solution to this problem, allowing specific semantics to be enforced during training. This solution, however, depends on the availability of precise labels, which are sometimes difficult or near impossible to obtain, e.g. labels representing lighting conditions or describing the background. In this paper we introduce a new formulation of the cGAN that is able to learn disentangled, multivariate models of semantically meaningful variation and which has the advantage of requiring only the weak supervision of binary attribute labels. For example, given only labels of ambient / non-ambient lighting, our method is able to learn multivariate lighting models disentangled from other factors such as the identity and pose. We coin the method intra-class variation isolation (IVI) and the resulting network the IVI-GAN. We evaluate IVI-GAN on the CelebA dataset and on synthetic 3D morphable model data, learning to disentangle attributes such as lighting, pose, expression, and even the background.\n",
      "Password guessing approaches via deep learning have recently been investigated with significant breakthroughs in their ability to generate novel, realistic password candidates. In the present work we study a broad collection of deep learning and probabilistic based models in the light of password guessing: attention-based deep neural networks, autoencoding mechanisms and generative adversarial networks. We provide novel generative deep-learning models in terms of variational autoencoders exhibiting state-of-art sampling performance, yielding additional latent-space features such as interpolations and targeted sampling. Lastly, we perform a thorough empirical analysis in a unified controlled framework over well-known datasets (RockYou, LinkedIn, Youku, Zomato, Pwnd). Our results not only identify the most promising schemes driven by deep neural networks, but also illustrate the strengths of each approach in terms of generation variability and sample uniqueness.\n",
      "As deep learning technologies advance, increasingly more data is necessary to generate general and robust models for various tasks. In the medical domain, however, large-scale and multi-parties data training and analyses are infeasible due to the privacy and data security concerns. In this paper, we propose an extendable and elastic learning framework to preserve privacy and security while enabling collaborative learning with efficient communication. The proposed framework is named distributed Asynchronized Discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (AsynDGAN), which consists of a centralized generator and multiple distributed discriminators. The advantages of our proposed framework are five-fold: 1) the central generator could learn the real data distribution from multiple datasets implicitly without sharing the image data; 2) the framework is applicable for single-modality or multi-modality data; 3) the learned generator can be used to synthesize samples for down-stream learning tasks to achieve close-to-real performance as using actual samples collected from multiple data centers; 4) the synthetic samples can also be used to augment data or complete missing modalities for one single data center; 5) the learning process is more efficient and requires lower bandwidth than other distributed deep learning methods.\n",
      "When formulated as an unsupervised learning problem, anomaly detection often requires a model to learn the distribution of normal data. Previous works apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to anomaly detection tasks and show good performances from these models. Motivated by the observation that GAN ensembles often outperform single GANs in generation tasks, we propose to construct GAN ensembles for anomaly detection. In the proposed method, a group of generators and a group of discriminators are trained together, so every generator gets feedback from multiple discriminators, and vice versa. Compared to a single GAN, a GAN ensemble can better model the distribution of normal data and thus better detect anomalies. Our theoretical analysis of GANs and GAN ensembles explains the role of a GAN discriminator in anomaly detection. In the empirical study, we evaluate ensembles constructed from four types of base models, and the results show that these ensembles clearly outperform single models in a series of tasks of anomaly detection.\n",
      "Generative adversarial network (GAN) is among the most popular deep learning models for learning complex data distributions. However, training a GAN is known to be a challenging task. This is often attributed to the lack of correlation between the training progress and the trajectory of the generator and discriminator losses and the need for the GAN's subjective evaluation. A recently proposed measure inspired by game theory - the duality gap, aims to bridge this gap. However, as we demonstrate, the duality gap's capability remains constrained due to limitations posed by its estimation process. This paper presents a theoretical understanding of this limitation and proposes a more dependable estimation process for the duality gap. At the crux of our approach is the idea that local perturbations can help agents in a zero-sum game escape non-Nash saddle points efficiently. Through exhaustive experimentation across GAN models and datasets, we establish the efficacy of our approach in capturing the GAN training progress with minimal increase to the computational complexity. Further, we show that our estimate, with its ability to identify model convergence/divergence, is a potential performance measure that can be used to tune the hyperparameters of a GAN.\n",
      "While a lot of progress has been made in recent years, the dynamics of learning in deep nonlinear neural networks remain to this day largely misunderstood. In this work, we study the case of binary classification and prove various properties of learning in such networks under strong assumptions such as linear separability of the data. Extending existing results from the linear case, we confirm empirical observations by proving that the classification error also follows a sigmoidal shape in nonlinear architectures. We show that given proper initialization, learning expounds parallel independent modes and that certain regions of parameter space might lead to failed training. We also demonstrate that input norm and features' frequency in the dataset lead to distinct convergence speeds which might shed some light on the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks. We provide a comparison between the dynamics of learning with cross-entropy and hinge losses, which could prove useful to understand recent progress in the training of generative adversarial networks. Finally, we identify a phenomenon that we baptize gradient starvation where the most frequent features in a dataset prevent the learning of other less frequent but equally informative features.\n",
      "Training robust supervised deep learning models for many geospatial applications of computer vision is difficult due to dearth of class-balanced and diverse training data. Conversely, obtaining enough training data for many applications is financially prohibitive or may be infeasible, especially when the application involves modeling rare or extreme events. Synthetically generating data (and labels) using a generative model that can sample from a target distribution and exploit the multi-scale nature of images can be an inexpensive solution to address scarcity of labeled data. Towards this goal, we present a deep conditional generative model, called VAE-Info-cGAN, that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a conditional Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN), for synthesizing semantically rich images simultaneously conditioned on a pixel-level condition (PLC) and a macroscopic feature-level condition (FLC). Dimensionally, the PLC can only vary in the channel dimension from the synthesized image and is meant to be a task-specific input. The FLC is modeled as an attribute vector in the latent space of the generated image which controls the contributions of various characteristic attributes germane to the target distribution. An interpretation of the attribute vector to systematically generate synthetic images by varying a chosen binary macroscopic feature is explored. Experiments on a GPS trajectories dataset show that the proposed model can accurately generate various forms of spatio-temporal aggregates across different geographic locations while conditioned only on a raster representation of the road network. The primary intended application of the VAE-Info-cGAN is synthetic data (and label) generation for targeted data augmentation for computer vision-based modeling of problems relevant to geospatial analysis and remote sensing.\n",
      "A central problem in machine learning and statistics is to model joint densities of random variables from data. Copulas are joint cumulative distribution functions with uniform marginal distributions and are used to capture interdependencies in isolation from marginals. Copulas are widely used within statistics, but have not gained traction in the context of modern deep learning. In this paper, we introduce ACNet, a novel differentiable neural network architecture that enforces structural properties and enables one to learn an important class of copulas--Archimedean Copulas. Unlike Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, or Normalizing Flow methods, which learn either densities or the generative process directly, ACNet learns a generator of the copula, which implicitly defines the cumulative distribution function of a joint distribution. We give a probabilistic interpretation of the network parameters of ACNet and use this to derive a simple but efficient sampling algorithm for the learned copula. Our experiments show that ACNet is able to both approximate common Archimedean Copulas and generate new copulas which may provide better fits to data.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) struggle to generate structured objects like molecules and game maps. The issue is that structured objects must satisfy hard requirements (e.g., molecules must be chemically valid) that are difficult to acquire from examples alone. As a remedy, we propose Constrained Adversarial Networks (CANs), an extension of GANs in which the constraints are embedded into the model during training. This is achieved by penalizing the generator proportionally to the mass it allocates to invalid structures. In contrast to other generative models, CANs support efficient inference of valid structures (with high probability) and allows to turn on and off the learned constraints at inference time. CANs handle arbitrary logical constraints and leverage knowledge compilation techniques to efficiently evaluate the disagreement between the model and the constraints. Our setup is further extended to hybrid logical-neural constraints for capturing very complex constraints, like graph reachability. An extensive empirical analysis shows that CANs efficiently generate valid structures that are both high-quality and novel.\n",
      "Medical image translation (e.g. CT to MR) is a challenging task as it requires I) faithful translation of domain-invariant features (e.g. shape information of anatomical structures) and II) realistic synthesis of target-domain features (e.g. tissue appearance in MR). In this work, we propose Manifold Disentanglement Generative Adversarial Network (MDGAN), a novel image translation framework that explicitly models these two types of features. It employs a fully convolutional generator to model domain-invariant features, and it uses style codes to separately model target-domain features as a manifold. This design aims to explicitly disentangle domain-invariant features and domain-specific features while gaining individual control of both. The image translation process is formulated as a stylisation task, where the input is \"stylised\" (translated) into diverse target-domain images based on style codes sampled from the learnt manifold. We test MDGAN for multi-modal medical image translation, where we create two domain-specific manifold clusters on the manifold to translate segmentation maps into pseudo-CT and pseudo-MR images, respectively. We show that by traversing a path across the MR manifold cluster, the target output can be manipulated while still retaining the shape information from the input.\n",
      "Photo-realistic visualization and animation of expressive human faces have been a long standing challenge. 3D face modeling methods provide parametric control but generates unrealistic images, on the other hand, generative 2D models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) output photo-realistic face images, but lack explicit control. Recent methods gain partial control, either by attempting to disentangle different factors in an unsupervised manner, or by adding control post hoc to a pre-trained model. Unconditional GANs, however, may entangle factors that are hard to undo later. We condition our generative model on pre-defined control parameters to encourage disentanglement in the generation process. Specifically, we condition StyleGAN2 on FLAME, a generative 3D face model. While conditioning on FLAME parameters yields unsatisfactory results, we find that conditioning on rendered FLAME geometry and photometric details works well. This gives us a generative 2D face model named GIF (Generative Interpretable Faces) that offers FLAME's parametric control. Here, interpretable refers to the semantic meaning of different parameters. Given FLAME parameters for shape, pose, expressions, parameters for appearance, lighting, and an additional style vector, GIF outputs photo-realistic face images. We perform an AMT based perceptual study to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate how well GIF follows its conditioning. The code, data, and trained model are publicly available for research purposes at http://gif.is.tue.mpg.de.\n",
      "Machine learning practitioners frequently seek to leverage the most informative available data, without violating the data owner's privacy, when building predictive models. Differentially private data synthesis protects personal details from exposure, and allows for the training of differentially private machine learning models on privately generated datasets. But how can we effectively assess the efficacy of differentially private synthetic data? In this paper, we survey four differentially private generative adversarial networks for data synthesis. We evaluate each of them at scale on five standard tabular datasets, and in two applied industry scenarios. We benchmark with novel metrics from recent literature and other standard machine learning tools. Our results suggest some synthesizers are more applicable for different privacy budgets, and we further demonstrate complicating domain-based tradeoffs in selecting an approach. We offer experimental learning on applied machine learning scenarios with private internal data to researchers and practioners alike. In addition, we propose QUAIL, an ensemble-based modeling approach to generating synthetic data. We examine QUAIL's tradeoffs, and note circumstances in which it outperforms baseline differentially private supervised learning models under the same budget constraint.\n",
      "Synthesizing realistic data samples is of great value for both academic and industrial communities. Deep generative models have become an emerging topic in various research areas like computer vision and signal processing. Affective computing, a topic of a broad interest in computer vision society, has been no exception and has benefited from generative models. In fact, affective computing observed a rapid derivation of generative models during the last two decades. Applications of such models include but are not limited to emotion recognition and classification, unimodal emotion synthesis, and cross-modal emotion synthesis. As a result, we conducted a review of recent advances in human emotion synthesis by studying available databases, advantages, and disadvantages of the generative models along with the related training strategies considering two principal human communication modalities, namely audio and video. In this context, facial expression synthesis, speech emotion synthesis, and the audio-visual (cross-modal) emotion synthesis is reviewed extensively under different application scenarios. Gradually, we discuss open research problems to push the boundaries of this research area for future works.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can accurately model complex multi-dimensional data and generate realistic samples. However, due to their implicit estimation of data distributions, their evaluation is a challenging task. The majority of research efforts associated with tackling this issue were validated by qualitative visual evaluation. Such approaches do not generalize well beyond the image domain. Since many of those evaluation metrics are proposed and bound to the vision domain, they are difficult to apply to other domains. Quantitative measures are necessary to better guide the training and comparison of different GANs models. In this work, we leverage Siamese neural networks to propose a domain-agnostic evaluation metric: (1) with a qualitative evaluation that is consistent with human evaluation, (2) that is robust relative to common GAN issues such as mode dropping and invention, and (3) does not require any pretrained classifier. The empirical results in this paper demonstrate the superiority of this method compared to the popular Inception Score and are competitive with the FID score.\n",
      "The introduction of surgical robots brought about advancements in surgical procedures. The applications of remote telesurgery range from building medical clinics in underprivileged areas, to placing robots abroad in military hot-spots where accessibility and diversity of medical experience may be limited. Poor wireless connectivity may result in a prolonged delay, referred to as latency, between a surgeon's input and action a robot takes. In surgery, any micro-delay can injure a patient severely and in some cases, result in fatality. One was to increase safety is to mitigate the effects of latency using deep learning aided computer vision. While the current surgical robots use calibrated sensors to measure the position of the arms and tools, in this work we present a purely optical approach that provides a measurement of the tool position in relation to the patient's tissues. This research aimed to produce a neural network that allowed a robot to detect its own mechanical manipulator arms. A conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) was trained on 1107 frames of mock gastrointestinal robotic surgery data from the 2015 EndoVis Instrument Challenge and corresponding hand-drawn labels for each frame. When run on new testing data, the network generated near-perfect labels of the input images which were visually consistent with the hand-drawn labels and was able to do this in 299 milliseconds. These accurately generated labels can then be used as simplified identifiers for the robot to track its own controlled tools. These results show potential for conditional GANs as a reaction mechanism such that the robot can detect when its arms move outside the operating area within a patient. This system allows for more accurate monitoring of the position of surgical instruments in relation to the patient's tissue, increasing safety measures that are integral to successful telesurgery systems.\n",
      "Machine learning predictors have been increasingly applied in production settings, including in one of the world's largest hiring platforms, Hired, to provide a better candidate and recruiter experience. The ability to provide actionable feedback is desirable for candidates to improve their chances of achieving success in the marketplace. Until recently, however, methods aimed at providing actionable feedback have been limited in terms of realism and latency. In this work, we demonstrate how, by applying a newly introduced method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we are able to overcome these limitations and provide actionable feedback in real-time to candidates in production settings. Our experimental results highlight the significant benefits of utilizing a GAN-based approach on our dataset relative to two other state-of-the-art approaches (including over 1000x latency gains). We also illustrate the potential impact of this approach in detail on two real candidate profile examples.\n",
      "The training of autonomous agents often requires expensive and unsafe trial-and-error interactions with the environment. Nowadays several data sets containing recorded experiences of intelligent agents performing various tasks, spanning from the control of unmanned vehicles to human-robot interaction and medical applications are accessible on the internet. With the intention of limiting the costs of the learning procedure it is convenient to exploit the information that is already available rather than collecting new data. Nevertheless, the incapability to augment the batch can lead the autonomous agents to develop far from optimal behaviours when the sampled experiences do not allow for a good estimate of the true distribution of the environment. Offline learning is the area of machine learning concerned with efficiently obtaining an optimal policy with a batch of previously collected experiences without further interaction with the environment. In this paper we adumbrate the ideas motivating the development of the state-of-the-art offline learning baselines. The listed methods consist in the introduction of epistemic uncertainty dependent constraints during the classical resolution of a Markov Decision Process, with and without function approximators, that aims to alleviate the bad effects of the distributional mismatch between the available samples and real world. We provide comments on the practical utility of the theoretical bounds that justify the application of these algorithms and suggest the utilization of Generative Adversarial Networks to estimate the distributional shift that affects all of the proposed model-free and model-based approaches.\n",
      "We present Mask-guided Generative Adversarial Network (MagGAN) for high-resolution face attribute editing, in which semantic facial masks from a pre-trained face parser are used to guide the fine-grained image editing process. With the introduction of a mask-guided reconstruction loss, MagGAN learns to only edit the facial parts that are relevant to the desired attribute changes, while preserving the attribute-irrelevant regions (e.g., hat, scarf for modification `To Bald'). Further, a novel mask-guided conditioning strategy is introduced to incorporate the influence region of each attribute change into the generator. In addition, a multi-level patch-wise discriminator structure is proposed to scale our model for high-resolution ($1024 \\times 1024$) face editing. Experiments on the CelebA benchmark show that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both image quality and editing performance.\n",
      "Recently, learning-based models have enhanced the performance of single-image super-resolution (SISR). However, applying SISR successively to each video frame leads to a lack of temporal coherency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperform traditional approaches in terms of image quality metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). However, generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a competitive advantage by being able to mitigate the issue of a lack of finer texture details, usually seen with CNNs when super-resolving at large upscaling factors. We present iSeeBetter, a novel GAN-based spatio-temporal approach to video super-resolution (VSR) that renders temporally consistent super-resolution videos. iSeeBetter extracts spatial and temporal information from the current and neighboring frames using the concept of recurrent back-projection networks as its generator. Furthermore, to improve the \"naturality\" of the super-resolved image while eliminating artifacts seen with traditional algorithms, we utilize the discriminator from super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN). Although mean squared error (MSE) as a primary loss-minimization objective improves PSNR/SSIM, these metrics may not capture fine details in the image resulting in misrepresentation of perceptual quality. To address this, we use a four-fold (MSE, perceptual, adversarial, and total-variation (TV)) loss function. Our results demonstrate that iSeeBetter offers superior VSR fidelity and surpasses state-of-the-art performance.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants have shown promising results in generating synthetic data. However, the issues with GANs are: (i) the learning happens around the training samples and the model often ends up remembering them, consequently, compromising the privacy of individual samples - this becomes a major concern when GANs are applied to training data including personally identifiable information, (ii) the randomness in generated data - there is no control over the specificity of generated samples. To address these issues, we propose imdpGAN - an information maximizing differentially private Generative Adversarial Network. It is an end-to-end framework that simultaneously achieves privacy protection and learns latent representations. With experiments on MNIST dataset, we show that imdpGAN preserves the privacy of the individual data point, and learns latent codes to control the specificity of the generated samples. We perform binary classification on digit pairs to show the utility versus privacy trade-off. The classification accuracy decreases as we increase privacy levels in the framework. We also experimentally show that the training process of imdpGAN is stable but experience a 10-fold time increase as compared with other GAN frameworks. Finally, we extend imdpGAN framework to CelebA dataset to show how the privacy and learned representations can be used to control the specificity of the output.\n",
      "Unprecedented data collection and sharing have exacerbated privacy concerns and led to increasing interest in privacy-preserving tools that remove sensitive attributes from images while maintaining useful information for other tasks. Currently, state-of-the-art approaches use privacy-preserving generative adversarial networks (PP-GANs) for this purpose, for instance, to enable reliable facial expression recognition without leaking users' identity. However, PP-GANs do not offer formal proofs of privacy and instead rely on experimentally measuring information leakage using classification accuracy on the sensitive attributes of deep learning (DL)-based discriminators. In this work, we question the rigor of such checks by subverting existing privacy-preserving GANs for facial expression recognition. We show that it is possible to hide the sensitive identification data in the sanitized output images of such PP-GANs for later extraction, which can even allow for reconstruction of the entire input images, while satisfying privacy checks. We demonstrate our approach via a PP-GAN-based architecture and provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations using two public datasets. Our experimental results raise fundamental questions about the need for more rigorous privacy checks of PP-GANs, and we provide insights into the social impact of these.\n",
      "The heavy traffic congestion problem has always been a concern for modern cities. To alleviate traffic congestion, researchers use reinforcement learning (RL) to develop better traffic signal control (TSC) algorithms in recent years. However, most RL models are trained and tested in the same traffic flow environment, which results in a serious overfitting problem. Since the traffic flow environment in the real world keeps varying, these models can hardly be applied due to the lack of generalization ability. Besides, the limited number of accessible traffic flow data brings extra difficulty in testing the generalization ability of the models. In this paper, we design a novel traffic flow generator based on Wasserstein generative adversarial network to generate sufficient diverse and quality traffic flows and use them to build proper training and testing environments. Then we propose a meta-RL TSC framework GeneraLight to improve the generalization ability of TSC models. GeneraLight boosts the generalization performance by combining the idea of flow clustering and model-agnostic meta-learning. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets to show the superior performance of GeneraLight on generalizing to different traffic flows.\n",
      "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) synthesize realistic images from a random latent vector. While many studies have explored various training configurations and architectures for GANs, the problem of inverting a generative model to extract latent vectors of given input images has been inadequately investigated. Although there is exactly one generated image per given random vector, the mapping from an image to its recovered latent vector can have more than one solution. We train a ResNet architecture to recover a latent vector for a given face that can be used to generate a face nearly identical to the target. We use a perceptual loss to embed face details in the recovered latent vector while maintaining visual quality using a pixel loss. The vast majority of studies on latent vector recovery perform well only on generated images, we argue that our method can be used to determine a mapping between real human faces and latent-space vectors that contain most of the important face style details. In addition, our proposed method projects generated faces to their latent-space with high fidelity and speed. At last, we demonstrate the performance of our approach on both real and generated faces.\n",
      "With the ever-increasing use of complex machine learning models in critical applications within the finance domain, explaining the decisions of the model has become a necessity. With applications spanning from credit scoring to credit marketing, the impact of these models is undeniable. Among the multiple ways in which one can explain the decisions of these complicated models, local post hoc model agnostic explanations have gained massive adoption. These methods allow one to explain each prediction independent of the modelling technique that was used while training. As explanations, they either give individual feature attributions or provide sufficient rules that represent conditions for a prediction to be made. The current state of the art methods use rudimentary methods to generate synthetic data around the point to be explained. This is followed by fitting simple linear models as surrogates to obtain a local interpretation of the prediction. In this paper, we seek to significantly improve on both, the method used to generate the explanations and the nature of explanations produced. We use a Generative Adversarial Network for synthetic data generation and train a piecewise linear model in the form of Linear Model Trees to be used as the surrogate model.In addition to individual feature attributions, we also provide an accompanying context to our explanations by leveraging the structure and property of our surrogate model.\n",
      "A major drawback of cross-network recommender solutions is that they can only be applied to users that are overlapped across networks. Thus, the non-overlapped users, which form the majority of users are ignored. As a solution, we propose CnGAN, a novel multi-task learning based, encoder-GAN-recommender architecture. The proposed model synthetically generates source network user preferences for non-overlapped users by learning the mapping from target to source network preference manifolds. The resultant user preferences are used in a Siamese network based neural recommender architecture. Furthermore, we propose a novel user based pairwise loss function for recommendations using implicit interactions to better guide the generation process in the multi-task learning environment.We illustrate our solution by generating user preferences on the Twitter source network for recommendations on the YouTube target network. Extensive experiments show that the generated preferences can be used to improve recommendations for non-overlapped users. The resultant recommendations achieve superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art cross-network recommender solutions in terms of accuracy, novelty and diversity.\n",
      "This paper proposes Entropy-Regularized Imitation Learning (ERIL), which is a combination of forward and inverse reinforcement learning under the framework of the entropy-regularized Markov decision process. ERIL minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two probability distributions induced by a learner and an expert. Inverse reinforcement learning (RL) in ERIL evaluates the log-ratio between two distributions using the density ratio trick, which is widely used in generative adversarial networks. More specifically, the log-ratio is estimated by building two binary discriminators. The first discriminator is a state-only function, and it tries to distinguish the state generated by the forward RL step from the expert's state. The second discriminator is a function of current state, action, and transitioned state, and it distinguishes the generated experiences from the ones provided by the expert. Since the second discriminator has the same hyperparameters of the forward RL step, it can be used to control the discriminator's ability. The forward RL minimizes the reverse KL estimated by the inverse RL. We show that minimizing the reverse KL divergence is equivalent to finding an optimal policy under entropy regularization. Consequently, a new policy is derived from an algorithm that resembles Dynamic Policy Programming and Soft Actor-Critic. Our experimental results on MuJoCo-simulated environments show that ERIL is more sample-efficient than such previous methods. We further apply the method to human behaviors in performing a pole-balancing task and show that the estimated reward functions show how every subject achieves the goal.\n",
      "MaskGAN opens the query for the conditional language model by filling in the blanks between the given tokens. In this paper, we focus on addressing the limitations caused by having to specify blanks to be filled. We decompose conditional text generation problem into two tasks, make-a-blank and fill-in-the-blank, and extend the former to handle more complex manipulations on the given tokens. We cast these tasks as a hierarchical multi agent RL problem and introduce a conditional adversarial learning that allows the agents to reach a goal, producing realistic texts, in cooperative setting. We show that the proposed model not only addresses the limitations but also provides good results without compromising the performance in terms of quality and diversity.\n",
      "Automated medical report generation in spine radiology, i.e., given spinal medical images and directly create radiologist-level diagnosis reports to support clinical decision making, is a novel yet fundamental study in the domain of artificial intelligence in healthcare. However, it is incredibly challenging because it is an extremely complicated task that involves visual perception and high-level reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose the neural-symbolic learning (NSL) framework that performs human-like learning by unifying deep neural learning and symbolic logical reasoning for the spinal medical report generation. Generally speaking, the NSL framework firstly employs deep neural learning to imitate human visual perception for detecting abnormalities of target spinal structures. Concretely, we design an adversarial graph network that interpolates a symbolic graph reasoning module into a generative adversarial network through embedding prior domain knowledge, achieving semantic segmentation of spinal structures with high complexity and variability. NSL secondly conducts human-like symbolic logical reasoning that realizes unsupervised causal effect analysis of detected entities of abnormalities through meta-interpretive learning. NSL finally fills these discoveries of target diseases into a unified template, successfully achieving a comprehensive medical report generation. When it employed in a real-world clinical dataset, a series of empirical studies demonstrate its capacity on spinal medical report generation as well as show that our algorithm remarkably exceeds existing methods in the detection of spinal structures. These indicate its potential as a clinical tool that contributes to computer-aided diagnosis.\n",
      "This paper considers the problem of enhancing user privacy in common machine learning development tasks, such as data annotation and inspection, by substituting the real data with samples form a generative adversarial network. We propose employing Bayesian differential privacy as the means to achieve a rigorous theoretical guarantee while providing a better privacy-utility trade-off. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach produces higher-fidelity samples, compared to prior work, allowing to (1) detect more subtle data errors and biases, and (2) reduce the need for real data labelling by achieving high accuracy when training directly on artificial samples.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have gained a lot of popularity from their introduction in 2014 till present. Research on GAN is rapidly growing and there are many variants of the original GAN focusing on various aspects of deep learning. GAN are perceived as the most impactful direction of machine learning in the last decade. This paper focuses on the application of GAN in autonomous driving including topics such as advanced data augmentation, loss function learning, semi-supervised learning, etc. We formalize and review key applications of adversarial techniques and discuss challenges and open problems to be addressed.\n",
      "Adversarial examples are a hot topic due to their abilities to fool a classifier's prediction. There are two strategies to create such examples, one uses the attacked classifier's gradients, while the other only requires access to the clas-sifier's prediction. This is particularly appealing when the classifier is not full known (black box model). In this paper, we present a new method which is able to generate natural adversarial examples from the true data following the second paradigm. Based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [5], it reweights the true data empirical distribution to encourage the classifier to generate ad-versarial examples. We provide a proof of concept of our method by generating adversarial hyperspectral signatures on a remote sensing dataset.\n",
      "Recently image-to-image translation has attracted significant interests in the literature, starting from the successful use of the generative adversarial network (GAN), to the introduction of cyclic constraint, to extensions to multiple domains. However, in existing approaches, there is no guarantee that the mapping between two image domains is unique or one-to-one. Here we propose a self-inverse network learning approach for unpaired image-to-image translation. Building on top of CycleGAN, we learn a self-inverse function by simply augmenting the training samples by swapping inputs and outputs during training and with separated cycle consistency loss for each mapping direction. The outcome of such learning is a proven one-to-one mapping function. Our extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including cross-modal medical image synthesis, object transfiguration, and semantic labeling, consistently demonstrate clear improvement over the CycleGAN method both qualitatively and quantitatively. Especially our proposed method reaches the state-of-the-art result on the cityscapes benchmark dataset for the label to photo unpaired directional image translation.\n",
      "In this work, we introduce a new method for imitation learning from video demonstrations. Our method, Relational Mimic (RM), improves on previous visual imitation learning methods by combining generative adversarial networks and relational learning. RM is flexible and can be used in conjunction with other recent advances in generative adversarial imitation learning to better address the need for more robust and sample-efficient approaches. In addition, we introduce a new neural network architecture that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning and illustrate how increasing the relational reasoning capabilities of the agent enables the latter to achieve increasingly higher performance in a challenging locomotion task with pixel inputs. Finally, we study the effects and contributions of relational learning in policy evaluation, policy improvement and reward learning through ablation studies.\n",
      "Network slicing is a key technology in 5G communications system. Its purpose is to dynamically and efficiently allocate resources for diversified services with distinct requirements over a common underlying physical infrastructure. Therein, demand-aware resource allocation is of significant importance to network slicing. In this paper, we consider a scenario that contains several slices in a radio access network with base stations that share the same physical resources (e.g., bandwidth or slots). We leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve this problem by considering the varying service demands as the environment state and the allocated resources as the environment action. In order to reduce the effects of the annoying randomness and noise embedded in the received service level agreement (SLA) satisfaction ratio (SSR) and spectrum efficiency (SE), we primarily propose generative adversarial network-powered deep distributional Q network (GAN-DDQN) to learn the action-value distribution driven by minimizing the discrepancy between the estimated action-value distribution and the target action-value distribution. We put forward a reward-clipping mechanism to stabilize GAN-DDQN training against the effects of widely-spanning utility values. Moreover, we further develop Dueling GAN-DDQN, which uses a specially designed dueling generator, to learn the action-value distribution by estimating the state-value distribution and the action advantage function. Finally, we verify the performance of the proposed GAN-DDQN and Dueling GAN-DDQN algorithms through extensive simulations.\n",
      "It is common for pathologists to annotate specific regions of the tissue, such as tumor, directly on the glass slide with markers. Although this practice was helpful prior to the advent of histology whole slide digitization, it often occludes important details which are increasingly relevant to immuno-oncology due to recent advancements in digital pathology imaging techniques. The current work uses a generative adversarial network with cycle loss to remove these annotations while still maintaining the underlying structure of the tissue by solving an image-to-image translation problem. We train our network on up to 300 whole slide images with marker inks and show that 70% of the corrected image patches are indistinguishable from originally uncontaminated image tissue to a human expert. This portion increases 97% when we replace the human expert with a deep residual network. We demonstrated the fidelity of the method to the original image by calculating the correlation between image gradient magnitudes. We observed a revival of up to 94,000 nuclei per slide in our dataset, the majority of which were located on tissue border.\n",
      "In order to better engage with customers, retailers rely on extensive customer and product databases which allows them to better understand customer behaviour and purchasing patterns. This has long been a challenging task as customer modelling is a multi-faceted, noisy and time-dependent problem. The most common way to tackle this problem is indirectly through task-specific supervised learning prediction problems, with relatively little literature on modelling a customer by directly simulating their future transactions. In this paper we propose a method for generating realistic sequences of baskets that a given customer is likely to purchase over a period of time. Customer embedding representations are learned using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which takes into account the entire sequence of transaction data. Given the customer state at a specific point in time, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained to generate a plausible basket of products for the following week. The newly generated basket is then fed back into the RNN to update the customer's state. The GAN is thus used in tandem with the RNN module in a pipeline alternating between basket generation and customer state updating steps. This allows for sampling over a distribution of a customer's future sequence of baskets, which then can be used to gain insight into how to service the customer more effectively. The methodology is empirically shown to produce baskets that appear similar to real baskets and enjoy many common properties, including frequencies of different product types, brands, and prices. Furthermore, the generated data is able to replicate most of the strongest sequential patterns that exist between product types in the real data.\n",
      "We propose a novel architecture which is able to automatically anonymize faces in images while retaining the original data distribution. We ensure total anonymization of all faces in an image by generating images exclusively on privacy-safe information. Our model is based on a conditional generative adversarial network, generating images considering the original pose and image background. The conditional information enables us to generate highly realistic faces with a seamless transition between the generated face and the existing background. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse dataset of human faces, including unconventional poses, occluded faces, and a vast variability in backgrounds. Finally, we present experimental results reflecting the capability of our model to anonymize images while preserving the data distribution, making the data suitable for further training of deep learning models. As far as we know, no other solution has been proposed that guarantees the anonymization of faces while generating realistic images.\n",
      "Multi-agent systems have a wide range of applications in cooperative and competitive tasks. As the number of agents increases, nonstationarity gets more serious in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which brings great difficulties to the learning process. Besides, current mainstream algorithms configure each agent an independent network,so that the memory usage increases linearly with the number of agents which greatly slows down the interaction with the environment. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), this paper proposes an iterative update method (IU) to stabilize the nonstationary environment. Further, we add first-person perspective and represent all agents by only one network which can change agents' policies from sequential compute to batch compute. Similar to continual lifelong learning, we realize the iterative update method in this unified representative network (IUUR). In this method, iterative update can greatly alleviate the nonstationarity of the environment, unified representation can speed up the interaction with environment and avoid the linear growth of memory usage. Besides, this method does not bother decentralized execution and distributed deployment. Experiments show that compared with MADDPG, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance and saves wall-clock time by a large margin especially with more agents.\n",
      "This paper presents a novel approach for synthesizing facial affect; either in terms of the six basic expressions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise), or in terms of valence (i.e., how positive or negative is an emotion) and arousal (i.e., power of the emotion activation). The proposed approach accepts the following inputs: i) a neutral 2D image of a person; ii) a basic facial expression or a pair of valence-arousal (VA) emotional state descriptors to be generated, or a path of affect in the 2D VA Space to be generated as an image sequence. In order to synthesize affect in terms of VA, for this person, $600,000$ frames from the 4DFAB database were annotated. The affect synthesis is implemented by fitting a 3D Morphable Model on the neutral image, then deforming the reconstructed face and adding the inputted affect, and blending the new face with the given affect into the original image. Qualitative experiments illustrate the generation of realistic images, when the neutral image is sampled from thirteen well known lab-controlled or in-the-wild databases, including Aff-Wild, AffectNet, RAF-DB; comparisons with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) show the higher quality achieved by the proposed approach. Then, quantitative experiments are conducted, in which the synthesized images are used for data augmentation in training Deep Neural Networks to perform affect recognition over all databases; greatly improved performances are achieved when compared with state-of-the-art methods, as well as with GAN-based data augmentation, in all cases.\n",
      "Imitation from observation (IfO) is the problem of learning directly from state-only demonstrations without having access to the demonstrator's actions. The lack of action information both distinguishes IfO from most of the literature in imitation learning, and also sets it apart as a method that may enable agents to learn from a large set of previously inapplicable resources such as internet videos. In this paper, we propose both a general framework for IfO approaches and also a new IfO approach based on generative adversarial networks called generative adversarial imitation from observation (GAIfO). We conduct experiments in two different settings: (1) when demonstrations consist of low-dimensional, manually-defined state features, and (2) when demonstrations consist of high-dimensional, raw visual data. We demonstrate that our approach performs comparably to classical imitation learning approaches (which have access to the demonstrator's actions) and significantly outperforms existing imitation from observation methods in high-dimensional simulation environments.\n",
      "A significant part of MCMC methods can be considered as the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm with different proposal distributions. From this point of view, the problem of constructing a sampler can be reduced to the question - how to choose a proposal for the MH algorithm? To address this question, we propose to learn an independent sampler that maximizes the acceptance rate of the MH algorithm, which, as we demonstrate, is highly related to the conventional variational inference. For Bayesian inference, the proposed method compares favorably against alternatives to sample from the posterior distribution. Under the same approach, we step beyond the scope of classical MCMC methods and deduce the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework from scratch, treating the generator as the proposal and the discriminator as the acceptance test. On real-world datasets, we improve Frechet Inception Distance and Inception Score, using different GANs as a proposal distribution for the MH algorithm. In particular, we demonstrate improvements of recently proposed BigGAN model on ImageNet.\n",
      "Gaze correction aims to redirect the person's gaze into the camera by manipulating the eye region, and it can be considered as a specific image resynthesis problem. Gaze correction has a wide range of applications in real life, such as taking a picture with staring at the camera. In this paper, we propose a novel method that is based on the inpainting model to learn from the face image to fill in the missing eye regions with new contents representing corrected eye gaze. Moreover, our model does not require the training dataset labeled with the specific head pose and eye angle information, thus, the training data is easy to collect. To retain the identity information of the eye region in the original input, we propose a self-guided pretrained model to learn the angle-invariance feature. Experiments show our model achieves very compelling gaze-corrected results in the wild dataset which is collected from the website and will be introduced in details. Code is available at https://github.com/zhangqianhui/GazeCorrection.\n",
      "Unsupervised domain transfer is the task of transferring or translating samples from a source distribution to a different target distribution. Current solutions unsupervised domain transfer often operate on data on which the modes of the distribution are well-matched, for instance have the same frequencies of classes between source and target distributions. However, these models do not perform well when the modes are not well-matched, as would be the case when samples are drawn independently from two different, but related, domains. This mode imbalance is problematic as generative adversarial networks (GANs), a successful approach in this setting, are sensitive to mode frequency, which results in a mismatch of semantics between source samples and generated samples of the target distribution. We propose a principled method of re-weighting training samples to correct for such mass shift between the transferred distributions, which we call batch-weight. We also provide rigorous probabilistic setting for domain transfer and new simplified objective for training transfer networks, an alternative to complex, multi-component loss functions used in the current state-of-the art image-to-image translation models. The new objective stems from the discrimination of joint distributions and enforces cycle-consistency in an abstract, high-level, rather than pixel-wise, sense. Lastly, we experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in several image-to-image translation tasks.\n",
      "Visual inspection of underwater structures by vehicles, e.g. remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), plays an important role in scientific, military, and commercial sectors. However, the automatic extraction of information using software tools is hindered by the characteristics of water which degrade the quality of captured videos. As a contribution for restoring the color of underwater images, Underwater Denoising Autoencoder (UDAE) model is developed using a denoising autoencoder with U-Net architecture. The proposed network takes into consideration the accuracy and the computation cost to enable real-time implementation on underwater visual tasks using end-to-end autoencoder network. Underwater vehicles perception is improved by reconstructing captured frames; hence obtaining better performance in underwater tasks. Related learning methods use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate color corrected underwater images, and to our knowledge this paper is the first to deal with a single autoencoder capable of producing same or better results. Moreover, image pairs are constructed for training the proposed network, where it is hard to obtain such dataset from underwater scenery. At the end, the proposed model is compared to a state-of-the-art method.\n",
      "Point cloud data from 3D LiDAR sensors are one of the most crucial sensor modalities for versatile safety-critical applications such as self-driving vehicles. Since the annotations of point cloud data is an expensive and time-consuming process, therefore recently the utilisation of simulated environments and 3D LiDAR sensors for this task started to get some popularity. With simulated sensors and environments, the process for obtaining an annotated synthetic point cloud data became much easier. However, the generated synthetic point cloud data are still missing the artefacts usually exist in point cloud data from real 3D LiDAR sensors. As a result, the performance of the trained models on this data for perception tasks when tested on real point cloud data is degraded due to the domain shift between simulated and real environments. Thus, in this work, we are proposing a domain adaptation framework for bridging this gap between synthetic and real point cloud data. Our proposed framework is based on the deep cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) architecture. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed framework on the task of vehicle detection from a bird's eye view (BEV) point cloud images coming from real 3D LiDAR sensors. The framework has shown competitive results with an improvement of more than 7% in average precision score over other baseline approaches when tested on real BEV point cloud images.\n",
      "For machine learning task, lacking sufficient samples mean the trained model has low confidence to approach the ground truth function. Until recently, after the generative adversarial networks (GAN) had been proposed, we see the hope of small samples data augmentation (DA) with realistic fake data, and many works validated the viability of GAN-based DA. Although most of the works pointed out higher accuracy can be achieved using GAN-based DA, some researchers stressed that the fake data generated from GAN has inherent bias, and in this paper, we explored when the bias is so low that it cannot hurt the performance, we set experiments to depict the bias in different GAN-based DA setting, and from the results, we design a pipeline to inspect specific dataset is efficiently-augmentable with GAN-based DA or not. And finally, depending on our trial to reduce the bias, we proposed some advice to mitigate bias in GAN-based DA application.\n",
      "We deconstruct the performance of GANs into three components:   1. Formulation: we propose a perturbation view of the population target of GANs. Building on this interpretation, we show that GANs can be viewed as a generalization of the robust statistics framework, and propose a novel GAN architecture, termed as Cascade GANs, to provably recover meaningful low-dimensional generator approximations when the real distribution is high-dimensional and corrupted by outliers.   2. Generalization: given a population target of GANs, we design a systematic principle, projection under admissible distance, to design GANs to meet the population requirement using finite samples. We implement our principle in three cases to achieve polynomial and sometimes near-optimal sample complexities: (1) learning an arbitrary generator under an arbitrary pseudonorm; (2) learning a Gaussian location family under TV distance, where we utilize our principle provide a new proof for the optimality of Tukey median viewed as GANs; (3) learning a low-dimensional Gaussian approximation of a high-dimensional arbitrary distribution under Wasserstein distance. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off in the approximation error and statistical error in GANs, and show how to apply our principle with empirical samples to predict how many samples are sufficient for GANs in order not to suffer from the discriminator winning problem.   3. Optimization: we demonstrate alternating gradient descent is provably not locally asymptotically stable in optimizing the GAN formulation of PCA. We diagnose the problem as the minimax duality gap being non-zero, and propose a new GAN architecture whose duality gap is zero, where the value of the game is equal to the previous minimax value (not the maximin value). We prove the new GAN architecture is globally asymptotically stable in optimization under alternating gradient descent.\n",
      "In this paper, we study the generative models of sequential discrete data. To tackle the exposure bias problem inherent in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), generative adversarial networks (GANs) are introduced to penalize the unrealistic generated samples. To exploit the supervision signal from the discriminator, most previous models leverage REINFORCE to address the non-differentiable problem of sequential discrete data. However, because of the unstable property of the training signal during the dynamic process of adversarial training, the effectiveness of REINFORCE, in this case, is hardly guaranteed. To deal with such a problem, we propose a novel approach called Cooperative Training (CoT) to improve the training of sequence generative models. CoT transforms the min-max game of GANs into a joint maximization framework and manages to explicitly estimate and optimize Jensen-Shannon divergence. Moreover, CoT works without the necessity of pre-training via MLE, which is crucial to the success of previous methods. In the experiments, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, CoT shows superior or at least competitive performance on sample quality, diversity, as well as training stability.\n",
      "Multi-domain image-to-image translation is a problem where the goal is to learn mappings among multiple domains. This problem is challenging in terms of scalability because it requires the learning of numerous mappings, the number of which increases proportional to the number of domains. However, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged recently as a powerful framework for this problem. In particular, label-conditional extensions (e.g., StarGAN) have become a promising solution owing to their ability to address this problem using only a single unified model. Nonetheless, a limitation is that they rely on the availability of large-scale clean-labeled data, which are often laborious or impractical to collect in a real-world scenario. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel model called the label-noise robust image-to-image translation model (RMIT) that can learn a clean label conditional generator even when noisy labeled data are only available. In particular, we propose a novel loss called the virtual cycle consistency loss that is able to regularize cyclic reconstruction independently of noisy labeled data, as well as we introduce advanced techniques to boost the performance in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that RMIT is useful for obtaining label-noise robustness in various settings including synthetic and real-world noise.\n",
      "We present RL-GAN-Net, where a reinforcement learning (RL) agent provides fast and robust control of a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our framework is applied to point cloud shape completion that converts noisy, partial point cloud data into a high-fidelity completed shape by controlling the GAN. While a GAN is unstable and hard to train, we circumvent the problem by (1) training the GAN on the latent space representation whose dimension is reduced compared to the raw point cloud input and (2) using an RL agent to find the correct input to the GAN to generate the latent space representation of the shape that best fits the current input of incomplete point cloud. The suggested pipeline robustly completes point cloud with large missing regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train an RL agent to control the GAN, which effectively learns the highly nonlinear mapping from the input noise of the GAN to the latent space of point cloud. The RL agent replaces the need for complex optimization and consequently makes our technique real time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our pipelines can be used to enhance the classification accuracy of point cloud with missing data.\n",
      "The quality and size of training set have great impact on the results of deep learning-based face related tasks. However, collecting and labeling adequate samples with high quality and balanced distributions still remains a laborious and expensive work, and various data augmentation techniques have thus been widely used to enrich the training dataset. In this paper, we systematically review the existing works of face data augmentation from the perspectives of the transformation types and methods, with the state-of-the-art approaches involved. Among all these approaches, we put the emphasis on the deep learning-based works, especially the generative adversarial networks which have been recognized as more powerful and effective tools in recent years. We present their principles, discuss the results and show their applications as well as limitations. Different evaluation metrics for evaluating these approaches are also introduced. We point out the challenges and opportunities in the field of face data augmentation, and provide brief yet insightful discussions.\n",
      "In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have drawn a lot of attentions for learning the underlying distribution of data in various applications. Despite their wide applicability, training GANs is notoriously difficult. This difficulty is due to the min-max nature of the resulting optimization problem and the lack of proper tools of solving general (non-convex, non-concave) min-max optimization problems. In this paper, we try to alleviate this problem by proposing a new generative network that relies on the use of random discriminators instead of adversarial design. This design helps us to avoid the min-max formulation and leads to an optimization problem that is stable and could be solved efficiently. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using handwritten digits (MNIST) and Fashion products (Fashion-MNIST) data sets. While the resulting images are not as sharp as adversarial training, the use of random discriminator leads to a much faster algorithm as compared to the adversarial counterpart. This observation, at the minimum, illustrates the potential of the random discriminator approach for warm-start in training GANs.\n",
      "Frequent mine disasters cause a large number of casualties and property losses. Autonomous driving is a fundamental measure for solving this problem, and track detection is one of the key technologies for computer vision to achieve downhole automatic driving. The track detection result based on the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm lacks the detailed and unique description of the object and relies too much on visual postprocessing technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a track detection algorithm based on a multiscale conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). The generator is decomposed into global and local parts using a multigranularity structure in the generator network. A multiscale shared convolution structure is adopted in the discriminator network to further supervise training the generator. Finally, the Monte Carlo search technique is introduced to search the intermediate state of the generator, and the result is sent to the discriminator for comparison. Compared with the existing work, our model achieved 82.43\\% pixel accuracy and an average intersection-over-union (IOU) of 0.6218, and the detection of the track reached 95.01\\% accuracy in the downhole roadway scene test set.\n",
      "Image synthesis is a core problem in modern deep learning, and many recent architectures such as autoencoders and Generative Adversarial networks produce spectacular results on highly complex data, such as images of faces or landscapes. While these results open up a wide range of new, advanced synthesis applications, there is also a severe lack of theoretical understanding of how these networks work. This results in a wide range of practical problems, such as difficulties in training, the tendency to sample images with little or no variability, and generalisation problems. In this paper, we propose to analyse the ability of the simplest generative network, the autoencoder, to encode and decode two simple geometric attributes : size and position. We believe that, in order to understand more complicated tasks, it is necessary to first understand how these networks process simple attributes. For the first property, we analyse the case of images of centred disks with variable radii. We explain how the autoencoder projects these images to and from a latent space of smallest possible dimension, a scalar. In particular, we describe a closed-form solution to the decoding training problem in a network without biases, and show that during training, the network indeed finds this solution. We then investigate the best regularisation approaches which yield networks that generalise well. For the second property, position, we look at the encoding and decoding of Dirac delta functions, also known as `one-hot' vectors. We describe a hand-crafted filter that achieves encoding perfectly, and show that the network naturally finds this filter during training. We also show experimentally that the decoding can be achieved if the dataset is sampled in an appropriate manner.\n",
      "Endoscopy is a routine imaging technique used for both diagnosis and minimally invasive surgical treatment. Artifacts such as motion blur, bubbles, specular reflections, floating objects and pixel saturation impede the visual interpretation and the automated analysis of endoscopy videos. Given the widespread use of endoscopy in different clinical applications, we contend that the robust and reliable identification of such artifacts and the automated restoration of corrupted video frames is a fundamental medical imaging problem. Existing state-of-the-art methods only deal with the detection and restoration of selected artifacts. However, typically endoscopy videos contain numerous artifacts which motivates to establish a comprehensive solution.   We propose a fully automatic framework that can: 1) detect and classify six different primary artifacts, 2) provide a quality score for each frame and 3) restore mildly corrupted frames. To detect different artifacts our framework exploits fast multi-scale, single stage convolutional neural network detector. We introduce a quality metric to assess frame quality and predict image restoration success. Generative adversarial networks with carefully chosen regularization are finally used to restore corrupted frames.   Our detector yields the highest mean average precision (mAP at 5% threshold) of 49.0 and the lowest computational time of 88 ms allowing for accurate real-time processing. Our restoration models for blind deblurring, saturation correction and inpainting demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods. On a set of 10 test videos we show that our approach preserves an average of 68.7% which is 25% more frames than that retained from the raw videos.\n",
      "Facial attributes are important since they provide a detailed description and determine the visual appearance of human faces. In this paper, we aim at converting a face image to a sketch while simultaneously generating facial attributes. To this end, we propose a novel Attribute-Guided Sketch Generative Adversarial Network (ASGAN) which is an end-to-end framework and contains two pairs of generators and discriminators, one of which is used to generate faces with attributes while the other one is employed for image-to-sketch translation. The two generators form a W-shaped network (W-net) and they are trained jointly with a weight-sharing constraint. Additionally, we also propose two novel discriminators, the residual one focusing on attribute generation and the triplex one helping to generate realistic looking sketches. To validate our model, we have created a new large dataset with 8,804 images, named the Attribute Face Photo & Sketch (AFPS) dataset which is the first dataset containing attributes associated to face sketch images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network (i) generates more photo-realistic faces with sharper facial attributes than baselines and (ii) has good generalization capability on different generative tasks.\n",
      "The problem of predicting a novel view of the scene using an arbitrary number of observations is a challenging problem for computers as well as for humans. This paper introduces the Generative Adversarial Query Network (GAQN), a general learning framework for novel view synthesis that combines Generative Query Network (GQN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The conventional GQN encodes input views into a latent representation that is used to generate a new view through a recurrent variational decoder. The proposed GAQN builds on this work by adding two novel aspects: First, we extend the current GQN architecture with an adversarial loss function for improving the visual quality and convergence speed. Second, we introduce a feature-matching loss function for stabilizing the training procedure. The experiments demonstrate that GAQN is able to produce high-quality results and faster convergence compared to the conventional approach.\n",
      "Due to the lack of available annotated medical images, accurate computer-assisted diagnosis requires intensive Data Augmentation (DA) techniques, such as geometric/intensity transformations of original images; however, those transformed images intrinsically have a similar distribution to the original ones, leading to limited performance improvement. To fill the data lack in the real image distribution, we synthesize brain contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance (MR) images---realistic but completely different from the original ones---using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This study exploits Progressive Growing of GANs (PGGANs), a multi-stage generative training method, to generate original-sized 256 X 256 MR images for Convolutional Neural Network-based brain tumor detection, which is challenging via conventional GANs; difficulties arise due to unstable GAN training with high resolution and a variety of tumors in size, location, shape, and contrast. Our preliminary results show that this novel PGGAN-based DA method can achieve promising performance improvement, when combined with classical DA, in tumor detection and also in other medical imaging tasks.\n",
      "Time series forecasting is one of the challenging problems for humankind. Traditional forecasting methods using mean regression models have severe shortcomings in reflecting real-world fluctuations. While new probabilistic methods rush to rescue, they fight with technical difficulties like quantile crossing or selecting a prior distribution. To meld the different strengths of these fields while avoiding their weaknesses as well as to push the boundary of the state-of-the-art, we introduce ForGAN - one step ahead probabilistic forecasting with generative adversarial networks. ForGAN utilizes the power of the conditional generative adversarial network to learn the data generating distribution and compute probabilistic forecasts from it. We argue how to evaluate ForGAN in opposition to regression methods. To investigate probabilistic forecasting of ForGAN, we create a new dataset and demonstrate our method abilities on it. This dataset will be made publicly available for comparison. Furthermore, we test ForGAN on two publicly available datasets, namely Mackey-Glass dataset and Internet traffic dataset (A5M) where the impressive performance of ForGAN demonstrate its high capability in forecasting future values.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can produce images of remarkable complexity and realism but are generally structured to sample from a single latent source ignoring the explicit spatial interaction between multiple entities that could be present in a scene. Capturing such complex interactions between different objects in the world, including their relative scaling, spatial layout, occlusion, or viewpoint transformation is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a novel self-consistent Composition-by-Decomposition (CoDe) network to compose a pair of objects. Given object images from two distinct distributions, our model can generate a realistic composite image from their joint distribution following the texture and shape of the input objects. We evaluate our approach through qualitative experiments and user evaluations. Our results indicate that the learned model captures potential interactions between the two object domains, and generates realistic composed scenes at test time.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in supervised settings can generate photo-realistic corresponding output from low-definition input (SRGAN). Using the architecture presented in the SRGAN original paper [2], we explore how selecting a dataset affects the outcome by using three different datasets to see that SRGAN fundamentally learns objects, with their shape, color, and texture, and redraws them in the output rather than merely attempting to sharpen edges. This is further underscored with our demonstration that once the network learns the images of the dataset, it can generate a photo-like image with even a slight hint of what it might look like for the original from a very blurry edged sketch. Given a set of inference images, the network trained with the same dataset results in a better outcome over the one trained with arbitrary set of images, and we report its significance numerically with Frechet Inception Distance score [22].\n",
      "Kernels are powerful and versatile tools in machine learning and statistics. Although the notion of universal kernels and characteristic kernels has been studied, kernel selection still greatly influences the empirical performance. While learning the kernel in a data driven way has been investigated, in this paper we explore learning the spectral distribution of kernel via implicit generative models parametrized by deep neural networks. We called our method Implicit Kernel Learning (IKL). The proposed framework is simple to train and inference is performed via sampling random Fourier features. We investigate two applications of the proposed IKL as examples, including generative adversarial networks with MMD (MMD GAN) and standard supervised learning. Empirically, MMD GAN with IKL outperforms vanilla predefined kernels on both image and text generation benchmarks; using IKL with Random Kitchen Sinks also leads to substantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art kernel learning algorithms on popular supervised learning benchmarks. Theory and conditions for using IKL in both applications are also studied as well as connections to previous state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "In recent years, advances in machine learning algorithms, cheap computational resources, and the availability of big data have spurred the deep learning revolution in various application domains. In particular, supervised learning techniques in image analysis have led to superhuman performance in various tasks, such as classification, localization, and segmentation, while unsupervised learning techniques based on increasingly advanced generative models have been applied to generate high-resolution synthetic images indistinguishable from real images.   In this paper we consider a state-of-the-art machine learning model for image inpainting, namely a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network based on a fully convolutional architecture with a contextual attention mechanism. We show that this model can successfully be transferred to the setting of digital elevation models (DEMs) for the purpose of generating semantically plausible data for filling voids. Training, testing and experimentation is done on GeoTIFF data from various regions in Norway, made openly available by the Norwegian Mapping Authority.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most popular tools for learning complex high dimensional distributions. However, generalization properties of GANs have not been well understood. In this paper, we analyze the generalization of GANs in practical settings. We show that discriminators trained on discrete datasets with the original GAN loss have poor generalization capability and do not approximate the theoretically optimal discriminator. We propose a zero-centered gradient penalty for improving the generalization of the discriminator by pushing it toward the optimal discriminator. The penalty guarantees the generalization and convergence of GANs. Experiments on synthetic and large scale datasets verify our theoretical analysis.\n",
      "In this work, we propose a composition/decomposition framework for adversarially training generative models on composed data - data where each sample can be thought of as being constructed from a fixed number of components. In our framework, samples are generated by sampling components from component generators and feeding these components to a composition function which combines them into a \"composed sample\". This compositional training approach improves the modularity, extensibility and interpretability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - providing a principled way to incrementally construct complex models out of simpler component models, and allowing for explicit \"division of responsibility\" between these components. Using this framework, we define a family of learning tasks and evaluate their feasibility on two datasets in two different data modalities (image and text). Lastly, we derive sufficient conditions such that these compositional generative models are identifiable. Our work provides a principled approach to building on pre-trained generative models or for exploiting the compositional nature of data distributions to train extensible and interpretable models.\n",
      "This paper presents a novel framework for predicting shot location and type in tennis. Inspired by recent neuroscience discoveries we incorporate neural memory modules to model the episodic and semantic memory components of a tennis player. We propose a Semi Supervised Generative Adversarial Network architecture that couples these memory models with the automatic feature learning power of deep neural networks and demonstrate methodologies for learning player level behavioural patterns with the proposed framework. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model on tennis tracking data from the 2012 Australian Tennis open and exhibit applications of the proposed method in discovering how players adapt their style depending on the match context.\n",
      "Domain adaption (DA) and domain generalization (DG) are two closely related methods which are both concerned with the task of assigning labels to an unlabeled data set. The only dissimilarity between these approaches is that DA can access the target data during the training phase, while the target data is totally unseen during the training phase in DG. The task of DG is challenging as we have no earlier knowledge of the target samples. If DA methods are applied directly to DG by a simple exclusion of the target data from training, poor performance will result for a given task. In this paper, we tackle the domain generalization challenge in two ways. In our first approach, we propose a novel deep domain generalization architecture utilizing synthetic data generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The discrepancy between the generated images and synthetic images is minimized using existing domain discrepancy metrics such as maximum mean discrepancy or correlation alignment. In our second approach, we introduce a protocol for applying DA methods to a DG scenario by excluding the target data from the training phase, splitting the source data to training and validation parts, and treating the validation data as target data for DA. We conduct extensive experiments on four cross-domain benchmark datasets. Experimental results signify our proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for DG.\n",
      "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are capable of producing high quality image samples. However, unlike variational autoencoders (VAEs), GANs lack encoders that provide the inverse mapping for the generators, i.e., encode images back to the latent space. In this work, we consider adversarially learned generative models that also have encoders. We evaluate models based on their ability to produce high quality samples and reconstructions of real images. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we find that the baseline Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN) can be improved upon with the addition of an autoencoder loss, at the expense of an extra hyper-parameter to tune. Second, we show that comparable performance to BiGAN can be obtained by simply training an encoder to invert the generator of a normal GAN.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently achieved impressive results for many real-world applications, and many GAN variants have emerged with improvements in sample quality and training stability. However, they have not been well visualized or understood. How does a GAN represent our visual world internally? What causes the artifacts in GAN results? How do architectural choices affect GAN learning? Answering such questions could enable us to develop new insights and better models.   In this work, we present an analytic framework to visualize and understand GANs at the unit-, object-, and scene-level. We first identify a group of interpretable units that are closely related to object concepts using a segmentation-based network dissection method. Then, we quantify the causal effect of interpretable units by measuring the ability of interventions to control objects in the output. We examine the contextual relationship between these units and their surroundings by inserting the discovered object concepts into new images. We show several practical applications enabled by our framework, from comparing internal representations across different layers, models, and datasets, to improving GANs by locating and removing artifact-causing units, to interactively manipulating objects in a scene. We provide open source interpretation tools to help researchers and practitioners better understand their GAN models.\n",
      "The model reduction problem that eases the computation costs and latency of complex deep learning architectures has received an increasing number of investigations owing to its importance in model deployment. One promising method is knowledge distillation (KD), which creates a fast-to-execute student model to mimic a large teacher network. In this paper, we propose a method, called KDFM (Knowledge Distillation with Feature Maps), which improves the effectiveness of KD by learning the feature maps from the teacher network. Two major techniques used in KDFM are shared classifier and generative adversarial network. Experimental results show that KDFM can use a four layers CNN to mimic DenseNet-40 and use MobileNet to mimic DenseNet-100. Both student networks have less than 1\\% accuracy loss comparing to their teacher models for CIFAR-100 datasets. The student networks are 2-6 times faster than their teacher models for inference, and the model size of MobileNet is less than half of DenseNet-100's.\n",
      "Adversarial examples are typically constructed by perturbing an existing data point within a small matrix norm, and current defense methods are focused on guarding against this type of attack. In this paper, we propose unrestricted adversarial examples, a new threat model where the attackers are not restricted to small norm-bounded perturbations. Different from perturbation-based attacks, we propose to synthesize unrestricted adversarial examples entirely from scratch using conditional generative models. Specifically, we first train an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) to model the class-conditional distribution over data samples. Then, conditioned on a desired class, we search over the AC-GAN latent space to find images that are likely under the generative model and are misclassified by a target classifier. We demonstrate through human evaluation that unrestricted adversarial examples generated this way are legitimate and belong to the desired class. Our empirical results on the MNIST, SVHN, and CelebA datasets show that unrestricted adversarial examples can bypass strong adversarial training and certified defense methods designed for traditional adversarial attacks.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown considerable promise for mitigating the challenge of data scarcity when building machine learning-driven analysis algorithms. Specifically, a number of studies have shown that GAN-based image synthesis for data augmentation can aid in improving classification accuracy in a number of medical image analysis tasks, such as brain and liver image analysis. However, the efficacy of leveraging GANs for tackling prostate cancer analysis has not been previously explored. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce ProstateGAN, a GAN-based model for synthesizing realistic prostate diffusion imaging data. More specifically, in order to generate new diffusion imaging data corresponding to a particular cancer grade (Gleason score), we propose a conditional deep convolutional GAN architecture that takes Gleason scores into consideration during the training process. Experimental results show that high-quality synthetic prostate diffusion imaging data can be generated using the proposed ProstateGAN for specified Gleason scores.\n",
      "Solving inverse problems continues to be a central challenge in computer vision. Existing techniques either explicitly construct an inverse mapping using prior knowledge about the corruption, or learn the inverse directly using a large collection of examples. However, in practice, the nature of corruption may be unknown, and thus it is challenging to regularize the problem of inferring a plausible solution. On the other hand, collecting task-specific training data is tedious for known corruptions and impossible for unknown ones. We present MimicGAN, an unsupervised technique to solve general inverse problems based on image priors in the form of generative adversarial networks (GANs). Using a GAN prior, we show that one can reliably recover solutions to underdetermined inverse problems through a surrogate network that learns to mimic the corruption at test time. Our system successively estimates the corruption and the clean image without the need for supervisory training, while outperforming existing baselines in blind image recovery. We also demonstrate that MimicGAN improves upon recent GAN-based defenses against adversarial attacks and represents one of the strongest test-time defenses available today.\n",
      "Class labels have been empirically shown useful in improving the sample quality of generative adversarial nets (GANs). In this paper, we mathematically study the properties of the current variants of GANs that make use of class label information. With class aware gradient and cross-entropy decomposition, we reveal how class labels and associated losses influence GAN's training. Based on that, we propose Activation Maximization Generative Adversarial Networks (AM-GAN) as an advanced solution. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to validate our analysis and evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, where AM-GAN outperforms other strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art Inception Score (8.91) on CIFAR-10. In addition, we demonstrate that, with the Inception ImageNet classifier, Inception Score mainly tracks the diversity of the generator, and there is, however, no reliable evidence that it can reflect the true sample quality. We thus propose a new metric, called AM Score, to provide a more accurate estimation of the sample quality. Our proposed model also outperforms the baseline methods in the new metric.\n",
      "Generative concept representations have three major advantages over discriminative ones: they can represent uncertainty, they support integration of learning and reasoning, and they are good for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. We discuss probabilistic and generative deep learning, which generative concept representations are based on, and the use of variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks for learning generative concept representations, particularly for concepts whose data are sequences, structured data or graphs.\n",
      "The use of synthetic data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has become quite a popular method to do data augmentation for many applications. While practitioners celebrate this as an economical way to get more synthetic data that can be used to train downstream classifiers, it is not clear that they recognize the inherent pitfalls of this technique. In this paper, we aim to exhort practitioners against deriving any false sense of security against data biases based on data augmentation. To drive this point home, we show that starting with a dataset consisting of head-shots of engineering researchers, GAN-based augmentation \"imagines\" synthetic engineers, most of whom have masculine features and white skin color (inferred from a human subject study conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk). This demonstrates how biases inherent in the training data are reinforced, and sometimes even amplified, by GAN-based data augmentation; it should serve as a cautionary tale for the lay practitioners.\n",
      "Facial caricature is an art form of drawing faces in an exaggerated way to convey humor or sarcasm. In this paper, we propose the first Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for unpaired photo-to-caricature translation, which we call \"CariGANs\". It explicitly models geometric exaggeration and appearance stylization using two components: CariGeoGAN, which only models the geometry-to-geometry transformation from face photos to caricatures, and CariStyGAN, which transfers the style appearance from caricatures to face photos without any geometry deformation. In this way, a difficult cross-domain translation problem is decoupled into two easier tasks. The perceptual study shows that caricatures generated by our CariGANs are closer to the hand-drawn ones, and at the same time better persevere the identity, compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our CariGANs allow users to control the shape exaggeration degree and change the color/texture style by tuning the parameters or giving an example caricature.\n",
      "Designing a logo is a long, complicated, and expensive process for any designer. However, recent advancements in generative algorithms provide models that could offer a possible solution. Logos are multi-modal, have very few categorical properties, and do not have a continuous latent space. Yet, conditional generative adversarial networks can be used to generate logos that could help designers in their creative process. We propose LoGAN: an improved auxiliary classifier Wasserstein generative adversarial neural network (with gradient penalty) that is able to generate logos conditioned on twelve different colors. In 768 generated instances (12 classes and 64 logos per class), when looking at the most prominent color, the conditional generation part of the model has an overall precision and recall of 0.8 and 0.7 respectively. LoGAN's results offer a first glance at how artificial intelligence can be used to assist designers in their creative process and open promising future directions, such as including more descriptive labels which will provide a more exhaustive and easy-to-use system.\n",
      "Fault detection problem for closed loop uncertain dynamical systems, is investigated in this paper, using different deep learning based methods. Traditional classifier based method does not perform well, because of the inherent difficulty of detecting system level faults for closed loop dynamical system. Specifically, acting controller in any closed loop dynamical system, works to reduce the effect of system level faults. A novel Generative Adversarial based deep Autoencoder is designed to classify datasets under normal and faulty operating conditions. This proposed network performs significantly well when compared to any available classifier based methods, and moreover, does not require labeled fault incorporated datasets for training purpose. Finally, this aforementioned network's performance is tested on a high complexity building energy system dataset.\n",
      "It has been shown recently that deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) can learn to generate music in the form of piano-rolls, which represent music by binary-valued time-pitch matrices. However, existing models can only generate real-valued piano-rolls and require further post-processing, such as hard thresholding (HT) or Bernoulli sampling (BS), to obtain the final binary-valued results. In this paper, we study whether we can have a convolutional GAN model that directly creates binary-valued piano-rolls by using binary neurons. Specifically, we propose to append to the generator an additional refiner network, which uses binary neurons at the output layer. The whole network is trained in two stages. Firstly, the generator and the discriminator are pretrained. Then, the refiner network is trained along with the discriminator to learn to binarize the real-valued piano-rolls the pretrained generator creates. Experimental results show that using binary neurons instead of HT or BS indeed leads to better results in a number of objective measures. Moreover, deterministic binary neurons perform better than stochastic ones in both objective measures and a subjective test. The source code, training data and audio examples of the generated results can be found at https://salu133445.github.io/bmusegan/ .\n",
      "Even though end-to-end supervised learning has shown promising results for sensorimotor control of self-driving cars, its performance is greatly affected by the weather conditions under which it was trained, showing poor generalization to unseen conditions. In this paper, we show how knowledge can be transferred using semantic maps to new weather conditions without the need to obtain new ground truth data. To this end, we propose to divide the task of vehicle control into two independent modules: a control module which is only trained on one weather condition for which labeled steering data is available, and a perception module which is used as an interface between new weather conditions and the fixed control module. To generate the semantic data needed to train the perception module, we propose to use a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model to retrieve the semantic information for the new conditions in an unsupervised manner. We introduce a master-servant architecture, where the master model (semantic labels available) trains the servant model (semantic labels not available). We show that our proposed method trained with ground truth data for a single weather condition is capable of achieving similar results on the task of steering angle prediction as an end-to-end model trained with ground truth data of 15 different weather conditions.\n",
      "In standard generative adversarial network (SGAN), the discriminator estimates the probability that the input data is real. The generator is trained to increase the probability that fake data is real. We argue that it should also simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real because 1) this would account for a priori knowledge that half of the data in the mini-batch is fake, 2) this would be observed with divergence minimization, and 3) in optimal settings, SGAN would be equivalent to integral probability metric (IPM) GANs.   We show that this property can be induced by using a relativistic discriminator which estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than a randomly sampled fake data. We also present a variant in which the discriminator estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than fake data, on average. We generalize both approaches to non-standard GAN loss functions and we refer to them respectively as Relativistic GANs (RGANs) and Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs). We show that IPM-based GANs are a subset of RGANs which use the identity function.   Empirically, we observe that 1) RGANs and RaGANs are significantly more stable and generate higher quality data samples than their non-relativistic counterparts, 2) Standard RaGAN with gradient penalty generate data of better quality than WGAN-GP while only requiring a single discriminator update per generator update (reducing the time taken for reaching the state-of-the-art by 400%), and 3) RaGANs are able to generate plausible high resolutions images (256x256) from a very small sample (N=2011), while GAN and LSGAN cannot; these images are of significantly better quality than the ones generated by WGAN-GP and SGAN with spectral normalization.\n",
      "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be interpreted as an adversarial game between two players, a discriminator D and a generator G, in which D learns to classify real from fake data and G learns to generate realistic data by \"fooling\" D into thinking that fake data is actually real data. Currently, a dominating view is that G actually learns by minimizing a divergence given that the general objective function is a divergence when D is optimal. However, this view has been challenged due to inconsistencies between theory and practice. In this paper, we discuss of the properties associated with most loss functions for G (e.g., saturating/non-saturating f-GAN, LSGAN, WGAN, etc.). We show that these loss functions are not divergences and do not have the same equilibrium as expected of divergences. This suggests that G does not need to minimize the same objective function as D maximize, nor maximize the objective of D after swapping real data with fake data (non-saturating GAN) but can instead use a wide range of possible loss functions to learn to generate realistic data. We define GANs through two separate and independent D maximization and G minimization steps. We generalize the generator step to four new classes of loss functions, most of which are actual divergences (while traditional G loss functions are not). We test a wide variety of loss functions from these four classes on a synthetic dataset and on CIFAR-10. We observe that most loss functions converge well and provide comparable data generation quality to non-saturating GAN, LSGAN, and WGAN-GP generator loss functions, whether we use divergences or non-divergences. These results suggest that GANs do not conform well to the divergence minimization theory and form a much broader range of models than previously assumed.\n",
      "We introduce PathGAN, a deep neural network for visual scanpath prediction trained on adversarial examples. A visual scanpath is defined as the sequence of fixation points over an image defined by a human observer with its gaze. PathGAN is composed of two parts, the generator and the discriminator. Both parts extract features from images using off-the-shelf networks, and train recurrent layers to generate or discriminate scanpaths accordingly. In scanpath prediction, the stochastic nature of the data makes it very difficult to generate realistic predictions using supervised learning strategies, but we adopt adversarial training as a suitable alternative. Our experiments prove how PathGAN improves the state of the art of visual scanpath prediction on the iSUN and Salient360! datasets. Source code and models are available at https://imatge-upc.github.io/pathgan/\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a novel approach, 3D-RecGAN++, which reconstructs the complete 3D structure of a given object from a single arbitrary depth view using generative adversarial networks. Unlike existing work which typically requires multiple views of the same object or class labels to recover the full 3D geometry, the proposed 3D-RecGAN++ only takes the voxel grid representation of a depth view of the object as input, and is able to generate the complete 3D occupancy grid with a high resolution of 256^3 by recovering the occluded/missing regions. The key idea is to combine the generative capabilities of autoencoders and the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework, to infer accurate and fine-grained 3D structures of objects in high-dimensional voxel space. Extensive experiments on large synthetic datasets and real-world Kinect datasets show that the proposed 3D-RecGAN++ significantly outperforms the state of the art in single view 3D object reconstruction, and is able to reconstruct unseen types of objects.\n",
      "Recently, the cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) has been widely used for synthesis of multi-domain medical images. The domain-specific nonlinear deformations captured by CycleGAN make the synthesized images difficult to be used for some applications, for example, generating pseudo-CT for PET-MR attenuation correction. This paper presents a deformation-invariant CycleGAN (DicycleGAN) method using deformable convolutional layers and new cycle-consistency losses. Its robustness dealing with data that suffer from domain-specific nonlinear deformations has been evaluated through comparison experiments performed on a multi-sequence brain MR dataset and a multi-modality abdominal dataset. Our method has displayed its ability to generate synthesized data that is aligned with the source while maintaining a proper quality of signal compared to CycleGAN-generated data. The proposed model also obtained comparable performance with CycleGAN when data from the source and target domains are alignable through simple affine transformations.\n",
      "In this work we present a novel system for generation of virtual PET images using CT scans. We combine a fully convolutional network (FCN) with a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate simulated PET data from given input CT data. The synthesized PET can be used for false-positive reduction in lesion detection solutions. Clinically, such solutions may enable lesion detection and drug treatment evaluation in a CT-only environment, thus reducing the need for the more expensive and radioactive PET/CT scan. Our dataset includes 60 PET/CT scans from Sheba Medical center. We used 23 scans for training and 37 for testing. Different schemes to achieve the synthesized output were qualitatively compared. Quantitative evaluation was conducted using an existing lesion detection software, combining the synthesized PET as a false positive reduction layer for the detection of malignant lesions in the liver. Current results look promising showing a 28% reduction in the average false positive per case from 2.9 to 2.1. The suggested solution is comprehensive and can be expanded to additional body organs, and different modalities.\n",
      "We propose MAD-GAN, an intuitive generalization to the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and its conditional variants to address the well known problem of mode collapse. First, MAD-GAN is a multi-agent GAN architecture incorporating multiple generators and one discriminator. Second, to enforce that different generators capture diverse high probability modes, the discriminator of MAD-GAN is designed such that along with finding the real and fake samples, it is also required to identify the generator that generated the given fake sample. Intuitively, to succeed in this task, the discriminator must learn to push different generators towards different identifiable modes. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets and compare MAD-GAN with different variants of GAN. We show high quality diverse sample generations for challenging tasks such as image-to-image translation and face generation. In addition, we also show that MAD-GAN is able to disentangle different modalities when trained using highly challenging diverse-class dataset (e.g. dataset with images of forests, icebergs, and bedrooms). In the end, we show its efficacy on the unsupervised feature representation task. In Appendix, we introduce a similarity based competing objective (MAD-GAN-Sim) which encourages different generators to generate diverse samples based on a user defined similarity metric. We show its performance on the image-to-image translation, and also show its effectiveness on the unsupervised feature representation task.\n",
      "The ability to learn from incrementally arriving data is essential for any life-long learning system. However, standard deep neural networks forget the knowledge about the old tasks, a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting, when trained on incrementally arriving data. We discuss the biases in current Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based approaches that learn the classifier by knowledge distillation from previously trained classifiers. These biases cause the trained classifier to perform poorly. We propose an approach to remove these biases by distilling knowledge from the classifier of AC-GAN. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 show that this method is comparable to current state of the art rehearsal based approaches. The code for this paper is available at https://bit.ly/incremental-learning\n",
      "In this work, we present an interesting attempt on mixture generation: absorbing different image concepts (e.g., content and style) from different domains and thus generating a new domain with learned concepts. In particular, we propose a mixture generative adversarial network (MIXGAN). MIXGAN learns concepts of content and style from two domains respectively, and thus can join them for mixture generation in a new domain, i.e., generating images with content from one domain and style from another. MIXGAN overcomes the limitation of current GAN-based models which either generate new images in the same domain as they observed in training stage, or require off-the-shelf content templates for transferring or translation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MIXGAN as compared to related state-of-the-art GAN-based models.\n",
      "Generative adversarial models are powerful tools to model structure in complex distributions for a variety of tasks. Current techniques for learning generative models require an access to samples which have high quality, and advanced generative models are applied to generate samples from noisy training data through ambient modules. However, the modules are only practical for the output space of the generator, and their application in the hidden space is not well studied. In this paper, we extend the ambient module to the hidden space of the generator, and provide the uniqueness condition and the corresponding strategy for the ambient hidden generator in the adversarial training process. We report the practicality of the proposed method on the benchmark dataset.\n",
      "Although Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success in various tasks, they still face challenges in generating high quality images. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) aiming at generating high-resolution photo-realistic images. First, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network architecture, StackGAN-v1, for text-to-image synthesis. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on given text description, yielding low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. Second, an advanced multi-stage generative adversarial network architecture, StackGAN-v2, is proposed for both conditional and unconditional generative tasks. Our StackGAN-v2 consists of multiple generators and discriminators in a tree-like structure; images at multiple scales corresponding to the same scene are generated from different branches of the tree. StackGAN-v2 shows more stable training behavior than StackGAN-v1 by jointly approximating multiple distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed stacked generative adversarial networks significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods in generating photo-realistic images.\n",
      "Inspired by the tremendous success of deep generative models on generating continuous data like image and audio, in the most recent year, few deep graph generative models have been proposed to generate discrete data such as graphs. They are typically unconditioned generative models which has no control on modes of the graphs being generated. Differently, in this paper, we are interested in a new problem named \\emph{Deep Graph Translation}: given an input graph, we want to infer a target graph based on their underlying (both global and local) translation mapping. Graph translation could be highly desirable in many applications such as disaster management and rare event forecasting, where the rare and abnormal graph patterns (e.g., traffic congestions and terrorism events) will be inferred prior to their occurrence even without historical data on the abnormal patterns for this graph (e.g., a road network or human contact network). To achieve this, we propose a novel Graph-Translation-Generative Adversarial Networks (GT-GAN) which will generate a graph translator from input to target graphs. GT-GAN consists of a graph translator where we propose new graph convolution and deconvolution layers to learn the global and local translation mapping. A new conditional graph discriminator has also been proposed to classify target graphs by conditioning on input graphs. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed GT-GAN.\n",
      "While great progress has been made recently in automatic image manipulation, it has been limited to object centric images like faces or structured scene datasets. In this work, we take a step towards general scene-level image editing by developing an automatic interaction-free object removal model. Our model learns to find and remove objects from general scene images using image-level labels and unpaired data in a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. We achieve this with two key contributions: a two-stage editor architecture consisting of a mask generator and image in-painter that co-operate to remove objects, and a novel GAN based prior for the mask generator that allows us to flexibly incorporate knowledge about object shapes. We experimentally show on two datasets that our method effectively removes a wide variety of objects using weak supervision only\n",
      "In general, neural networks are not currently capable of learning tasks in a sequential fashion. When a novel, unrelated task is learnt by a neural network, it substantially forgets how to solve previously learnt tasks. One of the original solutions to this problem is pseudo-rehearsal, which involves learning the new task while rehearsing generated items representative of the previous task/s. This is very effective for simple tasks. However, pseudo-rehearsal has not yet been successfully applied to very complex tasks because in these tasks it is difficult to generate representative items. We accomplish pseudo-rehearsal by using a Generative Adversarial Network to generate items so that our deep network can learn to sequentially classify the CIFAR-10, SVHN and MNIST datasets. After training on all tasks, our network loses only 1.67% absolute accuracy on CIFAR-10 and gains 0.24% absolute accuracy on SVHN. Our model's performance is a substantial improvement compared to the current state of the art solution.\n",
      "State-of-the-art pedestrian detection models have achieved great success in many benchmarks. However, these models require lots of annotation information and the labeling process usually takes much time and efforts. In this paper, we propose a method to generate labeled pedestrian data and adapt them to support the training of pedestrian detectors. The proposed framework is built on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with multiple discriminators, trying to synthesize realistic pedestrians and learn the background context simultaneously. To handle the pedestrians of different sizes, we adopt the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) layer in the discriminator. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks. The results show that our framework can smoothly synthesize pedestrians on background images of variations and different levels of details. To quantitatively evaluate our approach, we add the generated samples into training data of the baseline pedestrian detectors and show the synthetic images are able to improve the detectors' performance.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants exhibit state-of-the-art performance in the class of generative models. To capture higher-dimensional distributions, the common learning procedure requires high computational complexity and a large number of parameters. The problem of employing such massive framework arises when deploying it on a platform with limited computational power such as mobile phones. In this paper, we present a new generative adversarial framework by representing each layer as a tensor structure connected by multilinear operations, aiming to reduce the number of model parameters by a large factor while preserving the generative performance and sample quality. To learn the model, we employ an efficient algorithm which alternatively optimizes both discriminator and generator. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that our model can achieve high compression rate for model parameters up to $35$ times when compared to the original GAN for MNIST dataset.\n",
      "We introduce a data-driven approach to aid the repairing and conservation of archaeological objects: ORGAN, an object reconstruction generative adversarial network (GAN). By using an encoder-decoder 3D deep neural network on a GAN architecture, and combining two loss objectives: a completion loss and an Improved Wasserstein GAN loss, we can train a network to effectively predict the missing geometry of damaged objects. As archaeological objects can greatly differ between them, the network is conditioned on a variable, which can be a culture, a region or any metadata of the object. In our results, we show that our method can recover most of the information from damaged objects, even in cases where more than half of the voxels are missing, without producing many errors.\n",
      "Combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with encoders that learn to encode data points has shown promising results in learning data representations in an unsupervised way. We propose a framework that combines an encoder and a generator to learn disentangled representations which encode meaningful information about the data distribution without the need for any labels. While current approaches focus mostly on the generative aspects of GANs, our framework can be used to perform inference on both real and generated data points. Experiments on several data sets show that the encoder learns interpretable, disentangled representations which encode descriptive properties and can be used to sample images that exhibit specific characteristics.\n",
      "Due to their complex nature, it is hard to characterize the ways in which machine learning models can misbehave or be exploited when deployed. Recent work on adversarial examples, i.e. inputs with minor perturbations that result in substantially different model predictions, is helpful in evaluating the robustness of these models by exposing the adversarial scenarios where they fail. However, these malicious perturbations are often unnatural, not semantically meaningful, and not applicable to complicated domains such as language. In this paper, we propose a framework to generate natural and legible adversarial examples that lie on the data manifold, by searching in semantic space of dense and continuous data representation, utilizing the recent advances in generative adversarial networks. We present generated adversaries to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for black-box classifiers for a wide range of applications such as image classification, textual entailment, and machine translation. We include experiments to show that the generated adversaries are natural, legible to humans, and useful in evaluating and analyzing black-box classifiers.\n",
      "We propose a new algorithm for training generative adversarial networks that jointly learns latent codes for both identities (e.g. individual humans) and observations (e.g. specific photographs). By fixing the identity portion of the latent codes, we can generate diverse images of the same subject, and by fixing the observation portion, we can traverse the manifold of subjects while maintaining contingent aspects such as lighting and pose. Our algorithm features a pairwise training scheme in which each sample from the generator consists of two images with a common identity code. Corresponding samples from the real dataset consist of two distinct photographs of the same subject. In order to fool the discriminator, the generator must produce pairs that are photorealistic, distinct, and appear to depict the same individual. We augment both the DCGAN and BEGAN approaches with Siamese discriminators to facilitate pairwise training. Experiments with human judges and an off-the-shelf face verification system demonstrate our algorithm's ability to generate convincing, identity-matched photographs.\n",
      "High spectral dimensionality and the shortage of annotations make hyperspectral image (HSI) classification a challenging problem. Recent studies suggest that convolutional neural networks can learn discriminative spatial features, which play a paramount role in HSI interpretation. However, most of these methods ignore the distinctive spectral-spatial characteristic of hyperspectral data. In addition, a large amount of unlabeled data remains an unexploited gold mine for efficient data use. Therefore, we proposed an integration of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and probabilistic graphical models for HSI classification. Specifically, we used a spectral-spatial generator and a discriminator to identify land cover categories of hyperspectral cubes. Moreover, to take advantage of a large amount of unlabeled data, we adopted a conditional random field to refine the preliminary classification results generated by GANs. Experimental results obtained using two commonly studied datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieved encouraging classification accuracy using a small number of data for training.\n",
      "Despite the growing prominence of generative adversarial networks (GANs), optimization in GANs is still a poorly understood topic. In this paper, we analyze the \"gradient descent\" form of GAN optimization i.e., the natural setting where we simultaneously take small gradient steps in both generator and discriminator parameters. We show that even though GAN optimization does not correspond to a convex-concave game (even for simple parameterizations), under proper conditions, equilibrium points of this optimization procedure are still \\emph{locally asymptotically stable} for the traditional GAN formulation. On the other hand, we show that the recently proposed Wasserstein GAN can have non-convergent limit cycles near equilibrium. Motivated by this stability analysis, we propose an additional regularization term for gradient descent GAN updates, which \\emph{is} able to guarantee local stability for both the WGAN and the traditional GAN, and also shows practical promise in speeding up convergence and addressing mode collapse.\n",
      "In recent years, there have been tremendous advancements in the field of machine learning. These advancements have been made through both academic as well as industrial research. Lately, a fair amount of research has been dedicated to the usage of generative models in the field of computer vision and image classification. These generative models have been popularized through a new framework called Generative Adversarial Networks. Moreover, many modified versions of this framework have been proposed in the last two years. We study the original model proposed by Goodfellow et al. as well as modifications over the original model and provide a comparative analysis of these models.\n",
      "Discriminating lung nodules as malignant or benign is still an underlying challenge. To address this challenge, radiologists need computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems which can assist in learning discriminative imaging features corresponding to malignant and benign nodules. However, learning highly discriminative imaging features is an open problem. In this paper, our aim is to learn the most discriminative features pertaining to lung nodules by using an adversarial learning methodology. Specifically, we propose to use unsupervised learning with Deep Convolutional-Generative Adversarial Networks (DC-GANs) to generate lung nodule samples realistically. We hypothesize that imaging features of lung nodules will be discriminative if it is hard to differentiate them (fake) from real (true) nodules. To test this hypothesis, we present Visual Turing tests to two radiologists in order to evaluate the quality of the generated (fake) nodules. Extensive comparisons are performed in discerning real, generated, benign, and malignant nodules. This experimental set up allows us to validate the overall quality of the generated nodules, which can then be used to (1) improve diagnostic decisions by mining highly discriminative imaging features, (2) train radiologists for educational purposes, and (3) generate realistic samples to train deep networks with big data.\n",
      "Adversarial learning of probabilistic models has recently emerged as a promising alternative to maximum likelihood. Implicit models such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) often generate better samples compared to explicit models trained by maximum likelihood. Yet, GANs sidestep the characterization of an explicit density which makes quantitative evaluations challenging. To bridge this gap, we propose Flow-GANs, a generative adversarial network for which we can perform exact likelihood evaluation, thus supporting both adversarial and maximum likelihood training. When trained adversarially, Flow-GANs generate high-quality samples but attain extremely poor log-likelihood scores, inferior even to a mixture model memorizing the training data; the opposite is true when trained by maximum likelihood. Results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that hybrid training can attain high held-out likelihoods while retaining visual fidelity in the generated samples.\n",
      "Semi-supervised learning methods using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promising empirical success recently. Most of these methods use a shared discriminator/classifier which discriminates real examples from fake while also predicting the class label. Motivated by the ability of the GANs generator to capture the data manifold well, we propose to estimate the tangent space to the data manifold using GANs and employ it to inject invariances into the classifier. In the process, we propose enhancements over existing methods for learning the inverse mapping (i.e., the encoder) which greatly improves in terms of semantic similarity of the reconstructed sample with the input sample. We observe considerable empirical gains in semi-supervised learning over baselines, particularly in the cases when the number of labeled examples is low. We also provide insights into how fake examples influence the semi-supervised learning procedure.\n",
      "FusionGAN is a novel genre fusion framework for music generation that integrates the strengths of generative adversarial networks and dual learning. In particular, the proposed method offers a dual learning extension that can effectively integrate the styles of the given domains. To efficiently quantify the difference among diverse domains and avoid the vanishing gradient issue, FusionGAN provides a Wasserstein based metric to approximate the distance between the target domain and the existing domains. Adopting the Wasserstein distance, a new domain is created by combining the patterns of the existing domains using adversarial learning. Experimental results on public music datasets demonstrated that our approach could effectively merge two genres.\n",
      "Preserving the utility of published datasets while simultaneously providing provable privacy guarantees is a well-known challenge. On the one hand, context-free privacy solutions, such as differential privacy, provide strong privacy guarantees, but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On the other hand, context-aware privacy solutions, such as information theoretic privacy, achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff, but assume that the data holder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP, learning the privacy mechanism is formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the individuals' private variables, and an adversary that tries to infer the private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP's performance, we investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models: (a) the binary data model, and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models, we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms, and show that the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion) match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can be easily applied in practice, even in the absence of dataset statistics.\n",
      "Generative moment matching network (GMMN) is a deep generative model that differs from Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by replacing the discriminator in GAN with a two-sample test based on kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Although some theoretical guarantees of MMD have been studied, the empirical performance of GMMN is still not as competitive as that of GAN on challenging and large benchmark datasets. The computational efficiency of GMMN is also less desirable in comparison with GAN, partially due to its requirement for a rather large batch size during the training. In this paper, we propose to improve both the model expressiveness of GMMN and its computational efficiency by introducing adversarial kernel learning techniques, as the replacement of a fixed Gaussian kernel in the original GMMN. The new approach combines the key ideas in both GMMN and GAN, hence we name it MMD GAN. The new distance measure in MMD GAN is a meaningful loss that enjoys the advantage of weak topology and can be optimized via gradient descent with relatively small batch sizes. In our evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR- 10, CelebA and LSUN, the performance of MMD-GAN significantly outperforms GMMN, and is competitive with other representative GAN works.\n",
      "Predicting and understanding human motion dynamics has many applications, such as motion synthesis, augmented reality, security, and autonomous vehicles. Due to the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GAN), there has been much interest in probabilistic estimation and synthetic data generation using deep neural network architectures and learning algorithms.   We propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model for probabilistic human motion prediction, trained with a modified version of improved Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN-GP), in which we use a custom loss function designed for human motion prediction. Our model, which we call HP-GAN, learns a probability density function of future human poses conditioned on previous poses. It predicts multiple sequences of possible future human poses, each from the same input sequence but a different vector z drawn from a random distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the quality of the non-deterministic predictions, we simultaneously train a motion-quality-assessment model that learns the probability that a given skeleton sequence is a real human motion.   We test our algorithm on two of the largest skeleton datasets: NTURGB-D and Human3.6M. We train our model on both single and multiple action types. Its predictive power for long-term motion estimation is demonstrated by generating multiple plausible futures of more than 30 frames from just 10 frames of input. We show that most sequences generated from the same input have more than 50\\% probabilities of being judged as a real human sequence. We will release all the code used in this paper to Github.\n",
      "A major bottleneck for developing general reinforcement learning agents is determining rewards that will yield desirable behaviors under various circumstances. We introduce a general mechanism for automatically specifying meaningful behaviors from raw pixels. In particular, we train a generative adversarial network to produce short sub-goals represented through motion templates. We demonstrate that this approach generates visually meaningful behaviors in unknown environments with novel agents and describe how these motions can be used to train reinforcement learning agents.\n",
      "The Visual Dialogue task requires an agent to engage in a conversation about an image with a human. It represents an extension of the Visual Question Answering task in that the agent needs to answer a question about an image, but it needs to do so in light of the previous dialogue that has taken place. The key challenge in Visual Dialogue is thus maintaining a consistent, and natural dialogue while continuing to answer questions correctly. We present a novel approach that combines Reinforcement Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate more human-like responses to questions. The GAN helps overcome the relative paucity of training data, and the tendency of the typical MLE-based approach to generate overly terse answers. Critically, the GAN is tightly integrated into the attention mechanism that generates human-interpretable reasons for each answer. This means that the discriminative model of the GAN has the task of assessing whether a candidate answer is generated by a human or not, given the provided reason. This is significant because it drives the generative model to produce high quality answers that are well supported by the associated reasoning. The method also generates the state-of-the-art results on the primary benchmark.\n",
      "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can implicitly learn rich distributions over images, audio, and data which are hard to model with an explicit likelihood. We present a practical Bayesian formulation for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning with GANs. Within this framework, we use stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to marginalize the weights of the generator and discriminator networks. The resulting approach is straightforward and obtains good performance without any standard interventions such as feature matching, or mini-batch discrimination. By exploring an expressive posterior over the parameters of the generator, the Bayesian GAN avoids mode-collapse, produces interpretable and diverse candidate samples, and provides state-of-the-art quantitative results for semi-supervised learning on benchmarks including SVHN, CelebA, and CIFAR-10, outperforming DCGAN, Wasserstein GANs, and DCGAN ensembles.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were intuitively and attractively explained under the perspective of game theory, wherein two involving parties are a discriminator and a generator. In this game, the task of the discriminator is to discriminate the real and generated (i.e., fake) data, whilst the task of the generator is to generate the fake data that maximally confuses the discriminator. In this paper, we propose a new viewpoint for GANs, which is termed as the minimizing general loss viewpoint. This viewpoint shows a connection between the general loss of a classification problem regarding a convex loss function and a f-divergence between the true and fake data distributions. Mathematically, we proposed a setting for the classification problem of the true and fake data, wherein we can prove that the general loss of this classification problem is exactly the negative f-divergence for a certain convex function f. This allows us to interpret the problem of learning the generator for dismissing the f-divergence between the true and fake data distributions as that of maximizing the general loss which is equivalent to the min-max problem in GAN if the Logistic loss is used in the classification problem. However, this viewpoint strengthens GANs in two ways. First, it allows us to employ any convex loss function for the discriminator. Second, it suggests that rather than limiting ourselves in NN-based discriminators, we can alternatively utilize other powerful families. Bearing this viewpoint, we then propose using the kernel-based family for discriminators. This family has two appealing features: i) a powerful capacity in classifying non-linear nature data and ii) being convex in the feature space. Using the convexity of this family, we can further develop Fenchel duality to equivalently transform the max-min problem to the max-max dual problem.\n",
      "Semi-supervised learning methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) obtained strong empirical results, but it is not clear 1) how the discriminator benefits from joint training with a generator, and 2) why good semi-supervised classification performance and a good generator cannot be obtained at the same time. Theoretically, we show that given the discriminator objective, good semisupervised learning indeed requires a bad generator, and propose the definition of a preferred generator. Empirically, we derive a novel formulation based on our analysis that substantially improves over feature matching GANs, obtaining state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets.\n",
      "It is commonly agreed that the use of relevant invariances as a good statistical bias is important in machine-learning. However, most approaches that explicitly incorporate invariances into a model architecture only make use of very simple transformations, such as translations and rotations. Hence, there is a need for methods to model and extract richer transformations that capture much higher-level invariances. To that end, we introduce a tool allowing to parametrize the set of filters of a trained convolutional neural network with the latent space of a generative adversarial network. We then show that the method can capture highly non-linear invariances of the data by visualizing their effect in the data space.\n",
      "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are an exciting alternative to algorithms for solving density estimation problems---using data to assess how likely samples are to be drawn from the same distribution. Instead of explicitly computing these probabilities, GANs learn a generator that can match the given probabilistic source. This paper looks particularly at this matching capability in the context of problems with one-dimensional outputs. We identify a class of function decompositions with properties that make them well suited to the critic role in a leading approach to GANs known as Wasserstein GANs. We show that Taylor and Fourier series decompositions belong to our class, provide examples of these critics outperforming standard GAN approaches, and suggest how they can be scaled to higher dimensional problems in the future.\n",
      "We present a novel method to solve image analogy problems : it allows to learn the relation between paired images present in training data, and then generalize and generate images that correspond to the relation, but were never seen in the training set. Therefore, we call the method Conditional Analogy Generative Adversarial Network (CAGAN), as it is based on adversarial training and employs deep convolutional neural networks. An especially interesting application of that technique is automatic swapping of clothing on fashion model photos. Our work has the following contributions. First, the definition of the end-to-end trainable CAGAN architecture, which implicitly learns segmentation masks without expensive supervised labeling data. Second, experimental results show plausible segmentation masks and often convincing swapped images, given the target article. Finally, we discuss the next steps for that technique: neural network architecture improvements and more advanced applications.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a novel 3D-RecGAN approach, which reconstructs the complete 3D structure of a given object from a single arbitrary depth view using generative adversarial networks. Unlike the existing work which typically requires multiple views of the same object or class labels to recover the full 3D geometry, the proposed 3D-RecGAN only takes the voxel grid representation of a depth view of the object as input, and is able to generate the complete 3D occupancy grid by filling in the occluded/missing regions. The key idea is to combine the generative capabilities of autoencoders and the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework, to infer accurate and fine-grained 3D structures of objects in high-dimensional voxel space. Extensive experiments on large synthetic datasets show that the proposed 3D-RecGAN significantly outperforms the state of the art in single view 3D object reconstruction, and is able to reconstruct unseen types of objects. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/Yang7879/3D-RecGAN.\n",
      "Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples generated by existing text-to-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256x256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.\n",
      "In this work we present a novel system for PET estimation using CT scans. We explore the use of fully convolutional networks (FCN) and conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) to export PET data from CT data. Our dataset includes 25 pairs of PET and CT scans where 17 were used for training and 8 for testing. The system was tested for detection of malignant tumors in the liver region. Initial results look promising showing high detection performance with a TPR of 92.3% and FPR of 0.25 per case. Future work entails expansion of the current system to the entire body using a much larger dataset. Such a system can be used for tumor detection and drug treatment evaluation in a CT-only environment instead of the expansive and radioactive PET-CT scan.\n",
      "We present a simple method for assessing the quality of generated images in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The method can be applied in any kind of GAN without interfering with the learning procedure or affecting the learning objective. The central idea is to define a likelihood function that correlates with the quality of the generated images. In particular, we derive a Gaussian likelihood function from the distribution of the embeddings (hidden activations) of the real images in the discriminator, and based on this, define two simple measures of how likely it is that the embeddings of generated images are from the distribution of the embeddings of the real images. This yields a simple measure of fitness for generated images, for all varieties of GANs. Empirical results on CIFAR-10 demonstrate a strong correlation between the proposed measures and the perceived quality of the generated images.\n",
      "Colorization of grayscale images has been a hot topic in computer vision. Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.\n",
      "Traditional GANs use a deterministic generator function (typically a neural network) to transform a random noise input $z$ to a sample $\\mathbf{x}$ that the discriminator seeks to distinguish. We propose a new GAN called Bayesian Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (BC-GANs) that use a random generator function to transform a deterministic input $y'$ to a sample $\\mathbf{x}$. Our BC-GANs extend traditional GANs to a Bayesian framework, and naturally handle unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning problems. Experiments show that the proposed BC-GANs outperforms the state-of-the-arts.\n",
      "Developments in deep generative models have allowed for tractable learning of high-dimensional data distributions. While the employed learning procedures typically assume that training data is drawn i.i.d. from the distribution of interest, it may be desirable to model distinct distributions which are observed sequentially, such as when different classes are encountered over time. Although conditional variations of deep generative models permit multiple distributions to be modeled by a single network in a disentangled fashion, they are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting when the distributions are encountered sequentially. In this paper, we adapt recent work in reducing catastrophic forgetting to the task of training generative adversarial networks on a sequence of distinct distributions, enabling continual generative modeling.\n",
      "As autonomous vehicles become an every-day reality, high-accuracy pedestrian detection is of paramount practical importance. Pedestrian detection is a highly researched topic with mature methods, but most datasets focus on common scenes of people engaged in typical walking poses on sidewalks. But performance is most crucial for dangerous scenarios, such as children playing in the street or people using bicycles/skateboards in unexpected ways. Such \"in-the-tail\" data is notoriously hard to observe, making both training and testing difficult. To analyze this problem, we have collected a novel annotated dataset of dangerous scenarios called the Precarious Pedestrian dataset. Even given a dedicated collection effort, it is relatively small by contemporary standards (around 1000 images). To allow for large-scale data-driven learning, we explore the use of synthetic data generated by a game engine. A significant challenge is selected the right \"priors\" or parameters for synthesis: we would like realistic data with poses and object configurations that mimic true Precarious Pedestrians. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we generate a massive amount of synthetic data and train a discriminative classifier to select a realistic subset, which we deem the Adversarial Imposters. We demonstrate that this simple pipeline allows one to synthesize realistic training data by making use of rendering/animation engines within a GAN framework. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that such data can be used to rank algorithms, suggesting that Adversarial Imposters can also be used for \"in-the-tail\" validation at test-time, a notoriously difficult challenge for real-world deployment.\n",
      "The ability of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to learn generative models mapping from simple latent distributions to arbitrarily complex data distributions has been demonstrated empirically, with compelling results showing that the latent space of such generators captures semantic variation in the data distribution. Intuitively, models trained to predict these semantic latent representations given data may serve as useful feature representations for auxiliary problems where semantics are relevant. However, in their existing form, GANs have no means of learning the inverse mapping -- projecting data back into the latent space. We propose Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs) as a means of learning this inverse mapping, and demonstrate that the resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning.\n",
      "A natural image usually conveys rich semantic content and can be viewed from different angles. Existing image description methods are largely restricted by small sets of biased visual paragraph annotations, and fail to cover rich underlying semantics. In this paper, we investigate a semi-supervised paragraph generative framework that is able to synthesize diverse and semantically coherent paragraph descriptions by reasoning over local semantic regions and exploiting linguistic knowledge. The proposed Recurrent Topic-Transition Generative Adversarial Network (RTT-GAN) builds an adversarial framework between a structured paragraph generator and multi-level paragraph discriminators. The paragraph generator generates sentences recurrently by incorporating region-based visual and language attention mechanisms at each step. The quality of generated paragraph sentences is assessed by multi-level adversarial discriminators from two aspects, namely, plausibility at sentence level and topic-transition coherence at paragraph level. The joint adversarial training of RTT-GAN drives the model to generate realistic paragraphs with smooth logical transition between sentence topics. Extensive quantitative experiments on image and video paragraph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our RTT-GAN in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. Qualitative results on telling diverse stories for an image also verify the interpretability of RTT-GAN.\n",
      "We propose Edward, a Turing-complete probabilistic programming language. Edward defines two compositional representations---random variables and inference. By treating inference as a first class citizen, on a par with modeling, we show that probabilistic programming can be as flexible and computationally efficient as traditional deep learning. For flexibility, Edward makes it easy to fit the same model using a variety of composable inference methods, ranging from point estimation to variational inference to MCMC. In addition, Edward can reuse the modeling representation as part of inference, facilitating the design of rich variational models and generative adversarial networks. For efficiency, Edward is integrated into TensorFlow, providing significant speedups over existing probabilistic systems. For example, we show on a benchmark logistic regression task that Edward is at least 35x faster than Stan and 6x faster than PyMC3. Further, Edward incurs no runtime overhead: it is as fast as handwritten TensorFlow.\n",
      "Although Generative Adversarial Networks achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of generative tasks, they are regarded as highly unstable and prone to miss modes. We argue that these bad behaviors of GANs are due to the very particular functional shape of the trained discriminators in high dimensional spaces, which can easily make training stuck or push probability mass in the wrong direction, towards that of higher concentration than that of the data generating distribution. We introduce several ways of regularizing the objective, which can dramatically stabilize the training of GAN models. We also show that our regularizers can help the fair distribution of probability mass across the modes of the data generating distribution, during the early phases of training and thus providing a unified solution to the missing modes problem.\n",
      "Bayesian inference on structured models typically relies on the ability to infer posterior distributions of underlying hidden variables. However, inference in implicit models or complex posterior distributions is hard. A popular tool for learning implicit models are generative adversarial networks (GANs) which learn parameters of generators by fooling discriminators. Typically, GANs are considered to be models themselves and are not understood in the context of inference. Current techniques rely on inefficient global discrimination of joint distributions to perform learning, or only consider discriminating a single output variable. We overcome these limitations by treating GANs as a basis for likelihood-free inference in generative models and generalize them to Bayesian posterior inference over factor graphs. We propose local learning rules based on message passing minimizing a global divergence criterion involving cooperating local adversaries used to sidestep explicit likelihood evaluations. This allows us to compose models and yields a unified inference and learning framework for adversarial learning. Our framework treats model specification and inference separately and facilitates richly structured models within the family of Directed Acyclic Graphs, including components such as intractable likelihoods, non-differentiable models, simulators and generally cumbersome models. A key result of our treatment is the insight that Bayesian inference on structured models can be performed only with sampling and discrimination when using nonparametric variational families, without access to explicit distributions. As a side-result, we discuss the link to likelihood maximization. These approaches hold promise to be useful in the toolbox of probabilistic modelers and enrich the gamut of current probabilistic programming applications.\n",
      "Understanding, predicting, and generating object motions and transformations is a core problem in artificial intelligence. Modeling sequences of evolving images may provide better representations and models of motion and may ultimately be used for forecasting, simulation, or video generation. Diagrammatic Abstract Reasoning is an avenue in which diagrams evolve in complex patterns and one needs to infer the underlying pattern sequence and generate the next image in the sequence. For this, we develop a novel Contextual Generative Adversarial Network based on Recurrent Neural Networks (Context-RNN-GANs), where both the generator and the discriminator modules are based on contextual history (modeled as RNNs) and the adversarial discriminator guides the generator to produce realistic images for the particular time step in the image sequence. We evaluate the Context-RNN-GAN model (and its variants) on a novel dataset of Diagrammatic Abstract Reasoning, where it performs competitively with 10th-grade human performance but there is still scope for interesting improvements as compared to college-grade human performance. We also evaluate our model on a standard video next-frame prediction task, achieving improved performance over comparable state-of-the-art.\n",
      "Handwriting is a skill learned by humans from a very early age. The ability to develop one's own unique handwriting as well as mimic another person's handwriting is a task learned by the brain with practice. This paper deals with this very problem where an intelligent system tries to learn the handwriting of an entity using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We propose a modified architecture of DCGAN (Radford, Metz, and Chintala 2015) to achieve this. We also discuss about applying reinforcement learning techniques to achieve faster learning. Our algorithm hopes to give new insights in this area and its uses include identification of forged documents, signature verification, computer generated art, digitization of documents among others. Our early implementation of the algorithm illustrates a good performance with MNIST datasets.\n",
      "Autonomous driving is one of the most recent topics of interest which is aimed at replicating human driving behavior keeping in mind the safety issues. We approach the problem of learning synthetic driving using generative neural networks. The main idea is to make a controller trainer network using images plus key press data to mimic human learning. We used the architecture of a stable GAN to make predictions between driving scenes using key presses. We train our model on one video game (Road Rash) and tested the accuracy and compared it by running the model on other maps in Road Rash to determine the extent of learning.\n",
      "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a recently proposed class of generative models in which a generator is trained to optimize a cost function that is being simultaneously learned by a discriminator. While the idea of learning cost functions is relatively new to the field of generative modeling, learning costs has long been studied in control and reinforcement learning (RL) domains, typically for imitation learning from demonstrations. In these fields, learning cost function underlying observed behavior is known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) or inverse optimal control. While at first the connection between cost learning in RL and cost learning in generative modeling may appear to be a superficial one, we show in this paper that certain IRL methods are in fact mathematically equivalent to GANs. In particular, we demonstrate an equivalence between a sample-based algorithm for maximum entropy IRL and a GAN in which the generator's density can be evaluated and is provided as an additional input to the discriminator. Interestingly, maximum entropy IRL is a special case of an energy-based model. We discuss the interpretation of GANs as an algorithm for training energy-based models, and relate this interpretation to other recent work that seeks to connect GANs and EBMs. By formally highlighting the connection between GANs, IRL, and EBMs, we hope that researchers in all three communities can better identify and apply transferable ideas from one domain to another, particularly for developing more stable and scalable algorithms: a major challenge in all three domains.\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated to successfully approximate complex data distributions. A relevant extension of this model is conditional GANs (cGANs), where the introduction of external information allows to determine specific representations of the generated images. In this work, we evaluate encoders to inverse the mapping of a cGAN, i.e., mapping a real image into a latent space and a conditional representation. This allows, for example, to reconstruct and modify real images of faces conditioning on arbitrary attributes. Additionally, we evaluate the design of cGANs. The combination of an encoder with a cGAN, which we call Invertible cGAN (IcGAN), enables to re-generate real images with deterministic complex modifications.\n",
      "We propose a higher-level associative memory for learning adversarial networks. Generative adversarial network (GAN) framework has a discriminator and a generator network. The generator (G) maps white noise (z) to data samples while the discriminator (D) maps data samples to a single scalar. To do so, G learns how to map from high-level representation space to data space, and D learns to do the opposite. We argue that higher-level representation spaces need not necessarily follow a uniform probability distribution. In this work, we use Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) as a higher-level associative memory and learn the probability distribution for the high-level features generated by D. The associative memory samples its underlying probability distribution and G learns how to map these samples to data space. The proposed associative adversarial networks (AANs) are generative models in the higher-levels of the learning, and use adversarial non-stochastic models D and G for learning the mapping between data and higher-level representation spaces. Experiments show the potential of the proposed networks.\n",
      "The GANs are generative models whose random samples realistically reflect natural images. It also can generate samples with specific attributes by concatenating a condition vector into the input, yet research on this field is not well studied. We propose novel methods of conditioning generative adversarial networks (GANs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We mainly introduce two models: an information retrieving model that extracts conditional information from the samples, and a spatial bilinear pooling model that forms bilinear features derived from the spatial cross product of an image and a condition vector. These methods significantly enhance log-likelihood of test data under the conditional distributions compared to the methods of concatenation.\n",
      "Consider learning a policy from example expert behavior, without interaction with the expert or access to reinforcement signal. One approach is to recover the expert's cost function with inverse reinforcement learning, then extract a policy from that cost function with reinforcement learning. This approach is indirect and can be slow. We propose a new general framework for directly extracting a policy from data, as if it were obtained by reinforcement learning following inverse reinforcement learning. We show that a certain instantiation of our framework draws an analogy between imitation learning and generative adversarial networks, from which we derive a model-free imitation learning algorithm that obtains significant performance gains over existing model-free methods in imitating complex behaviors in large, high-dimensional environments.\n",
      "We consider the problem of learning deep generative models from data. We formulate a method that generates an independent sample via a single feedforward pass through a multilayer perceptron, as in the recently proposed generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Training a generative adversarial network, however, requires careful optimization of a difficult minimax program. Instead, we utilize a technique from statistical hypothesis testing known as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which leads to a simple objective that can be interpreted as matching all orders of statistics between a dataset and samples from the model, and can be trained by backpropagation. We further boost the performance of this approach by combining our generative network with an auto-encoder network, using MMD to learn to generate codes that can then be decoded to produce samples. We show that the combination of these techniques yields excellent generative models compared to baseline approaches as measured on MNIST and the Toronto Face Database.\n",
      "Knowledge transfer from a complex high performing model to a simpler and potentially low performing one in order to enhance its performance has been of great interest over the last few years as it finds applications in important problems such as explainable artificial intelligence, model compression, robust model building and learning from small data. Known approaches to this problem (viz. Knowledge Distillation, Model compression, ProfWeight, etc.) typically transfer information directly (i.e. in a single/one hop) from the complex model to the chosen simple model through schemes that modify the target or reweight training examples on which the simple model is trained. In this paper, we propose a meta-approach where we transfer information from the complex model to the simple model by dynamically selecting and/or constructing a sequence of intermediate models of decreasing complexity that are less intricate than the original complex model. Our approach can transfer information between consecutive models in the sequence using any of the previously mentioned approaches as well as work in 1-hop fashion, thus generalizing these approaches. In the experiments on real data, we observe that we get consistent gains for different choices of models over 1-hop, which on average is more than 2\\% and reaches up to 8\\% in a particular case. We also empirically analyze conditions under which the multi-hop approach is likely to be beneficial over the traditional 1-hop approach, and report other interesting insights. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes such a multi-hop approach to perform knowledge transfer given a single high performing complex model, making it in our opinion, an important methodological contribution.\n",
      "Knowledge distillation is a generalized logits matching technique for model compression. Their equivalence is previously established on the condition of $\\textit{infinity temperature}$ and $\\textit{zero-mean normalization}$. In this paper, we prove that with only $\\textit{infinity temperature}$, the effect of knowledge distillation equals to logits matching with an extra regularization. Furthermore, we reveal that an additional weaker condition -- $\\textit{equal-mean initialization}$ rather than the original $\\textit{zero-mean normalization}$ already suffices to set up the equivalence. The key to our proof is we realize that in modern neural networks with the cross-entropy loss and softmax activation, the mean of back-propagated gradient on logits always keeps zero.\n",
      "Deep neural network pruning and quantization techniques have demonstrated it is possible to achieve high levels of compression with surprisingly little degradation to test set accuracy. However, this measure of performance conceals significant differences in how different classes and images are impacted by model compression techniques. We find that models with radically different numbers of weights have comparable top-line performance metrics but diverge considerably in behavior on a narrow subset of the dataset. This small subset of data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Compression disproportionately impacts model performance on the underrepresented long-tail of the data distribution. PIEs over-index on atypical or noisy images that are far more challenging for both humans and algorithms to classify. Our work provides intuition into the role of capacity in deep neural networks and the trade-offs incurred by compression. An understanding of this disparate impact is critical given the widespread deployment of compressed models in the wild.\n",
      "Deep neural network (DNN) model compression for efficient on-device inference is becoming increasingly important to reduce memory requirements and keep user data on-device. To this end, we propose a novel differentiable k-means clustering layer (DKM) and its application to train-time weight clustering-based DNN model compression. DKM casts k-means clustering as an attention problem and enables joint optimization of the parameters and clustering centroids. Unlike prior works that rely on additional regularizers and parameters, DKM-based compression keeps the original loss function and model architecture fixed. We evaluated DKM-based compression on various DNN models for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our results demonstrate that DMK delivers superior compression and accuracy trade-off on ImageNet1k and GLUE benchmarks. For example, DKM-based compression can offer 74.5% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy on ResNet50 DNN model with 3.3MB model size (29.4x model compression factor). For MobileNet-v1, which is a challenging DNN to compress, DKM delivers 62.8% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy with 0.74 MB model size (22.4x model compression factor). This result is 6.8% higher top-1 accuracy and 33% relatively smaller model size than the current state-of-the-art DNN compression algorithms. Additionally, DKM enables compression of DistilBERT model by 11.8x with minimal (1.1%) accuracy loss on GLUE NLP benchmarks.\n",
      "Current state-of-the-art Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods neither efficiently scale to multiple hardware platforms, nor handle diverse architectural search-spaces. To remedy this, we present DONNA (Distilling Optimal Neural Network Architectures), a novel pipeline for rapid, scalable and diverse NAS, that scales to many user scenarios. DONNA consists of three phases. First, an accuracy predictor is built using blockwise knowledge distillation from a reference model. This predictor enables searching across diverse networks with varying macro-architectural parameters such as layer types and attention mechanisms, as well as across micro-architectural parameters such as block repeats and expansion rates. Second, a rapid evolutionary search finds a set of pareto-optimal architectures for any scenario using the accuracy predictor and on-device measurements. Third, optimal models are quickly finetuned to training-from-scratch accuracy. DONNA is up to 100x faster than MNasNet in finding state-of-the-art architectures on-device. Classifying ImageNet, DONNA architectures are 20% faster than EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNetV2 on a Nvidia V100 GPU and 10% faster with 0.5% higher accuracy than MobileNetV2-1.4x on a Samsung S20 smartphone. In addition to NAS, DONNA is used for search-space extension and exploration, as well as hardware-aware model compression.\n",
      "Compared with tedious per-pixel mask annotating, it is much easier to annotate data by clicks, which costs only several seconds for an image. However, applying clicks to learn video semantic segmentation model has not been explored before. In this work, we propose an effective weakly-supervised video semantic segmentation pipeline with click annotations, called WeClick, for saving laborious annotating effort by segmenting an instance of the semantic class with only a single click. Since detailed semantic information is not captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor segmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory flow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named memory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring predictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt vanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick learns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click annotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate models during the inference period. Experimental results on Cityscapes and Camvid show that WeClick outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, increases performance by 10.24% mIoU than baseline, and achieves real-time execution.\n",
      "Advanced tensor decomposition, such as Tensor train (TT) and Tensor ring (TR), has been widely studied for deep neural network (DNN) model compression, especially for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using TT/TR always suffers significant accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for tensor decomposition-based model compression using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). By formulating TT decomposition-based model compression to an optimization problem with constraints on tensor ranks, we leverage ADMM technique to systemically solve this optimization problem in an iterative way. During this procedure, the entire DNN model is trained in the original structure instead of TT format, but gradually enjoys the desired low tensor rank characteristics. We then decompose this uncompressed model to TT format and fine-tune it to finally obtain a high-accuracy TT-format DNN model. Our framework is very general, and it works for both CNNs and RNNs, and can be easily modified to fit other tensor decomposition approaches. We evaluate our proposed framework on different DNN models for image classification and video recognition tasks. Experimental results show that our ADMM-based TT-format models demonstrate very high compression performance with high accuracy. Notably, on CIFAR-100, with 2.3X and 2.4X compression ratios, our models have 1.96% and 2.21% higher top-1 accuracy than the original ResNet-20 and ResNet-32, respectively. For compressing ResNet-18 on ImageNet, our model achieves 2.47X FLOPs reduction without accuracy loss.\n",
      "In deep model compression, the recent finding \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\" (LTH) (Frankle & Carbin, 2018) pointed out that there could exist a winning ticket (i.e., a properly pruned sub-network together with original weight initialization) that can achieve competitive performance than the original dense network. However, it is not easy to observe such winning property in many scenarios, where for example, a relatively large learning rate is used even if it benefits training the original dense model. In this work, we investigate the underlying condition and rationale behind the winning property, and find that the underlying reason is largely attributed to the correlation between initialized weights and final-trained weights when the learning rate is not sufficiently large. Thus, the existence of winning property is correlated with an insufficient DNN pretraining, and is unlikely to occur for a well-trained DNN. To overcome this limitation, we propose the \"pruning & fine-tuning\" method that consistently outperforms lottery ticket sparse training under the same pruning algorithm and the same total training epochs. Extensive experiments over multiple deep models (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet-v2) on different datasets have been conducted to justify our proposals.\n",
      "In this paper, we demonstrate the implementation of our ultra-efficient deep convolutional neural network architecture: CondenseNeXt on NXP BlueBox, an autonomous driving development platform developed for self-driving vehicles. We show that CondenseNeXt is remarkably efficient in terms of FLOPs, designed for ARM-based embedded computing platforms with limited computational resources and can perform image classification without the need of a CUDA enabled GPU. CondenseNeXt utilizes the state-of-the-art depthwise separable convolution and model compression techniques to achieve a remarkable computational efficiency. Extensive analyses are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets to verify the performance of CondenseNeXt Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It achieves state-of-the-art image classification performance on three benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10 (4.79% top-1 error), CIFAR-100 (21.98% top-1 error) and ImageNet (7.91% single model, single crop top-5 error). CondenseNeXt achieves final trained model size improvement of 2.9+ MB and up to 59.98% reduction in forward FLOPs compared to CondenseNet and can perform image classification on ARM-Based computing platforms without needing a CUDA enabled GPU support, with outstanding efficiency.\n",
      "Deep neural models in recent years have been successful in almost every field, including extremely complex problem statements. However, these models are huge in size, with millions (and even billions) of parameters, thus demanding more heavy computation power and failing to be deployed on edge devices. Besides, the performance boost is highly dependent on redundant labeled data. To achieve faster speeds and to handle the problems caused by the lack of data, knowledge distillation (KD) has been proposed to transfer information learned from one model to another. KD is often characterized by the so-called `Student-Teacher' (S-T) learning framework and has been broadly applied in model compression and knowledge transfer. This paper is about KD and S-T learning, which are being actively studied in recent years. First, we aim to provide explanations of what KD is and how/why it works. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey on the recent progress of KD methods together with S-T frameworks typically for vision tasks. In general, we consider some fundamental questions that have been driving this research area and thoroughly generalize the research progress and technical details. Additionally, we systematically analyze the research status of KD in vision applications. Finally, we discuss the potentials and open challenges of existing methods and prospect the future directions of KD and S-T learning.\n",
      "With the increasing demand to efficiently deploy DNNs on mobile edge devices, it becomes much more important to reduce unnecessary computation and increase the execution speed. Prior methods towards this goal, including model compression and network architecture search (NAS), are largely performed independently and do not fully consider compiler-level optimizations which is a must-do for mobile acceleration. In this work, we first propose (i) a general category of fine-grained structured pruning applicable to various DNN layers, and (ii) a comprehensive, compiler automatic code generation framework supporting different DNNs and different pruning schemes, which bridge the gap of model compression and NAS. We further propose NPAS, a compiler-aware unified network pruning, and architecture search. To deal with large search space, we propose a meta-modeling procedure based on reinforcement learning with fast evaluation and Bayesian optimization, ensuring the total number of training epochs comparable with representative NAS frameworks. Our framework achieves 6.7ms, 5.9ms, 3.9ms ImageNet inference times with 78.2%, 75% (MobileNet-V3 level), and 71% (MobileNet-V2 level) Top-1 accuracy respectively on an off-the-shelf mobile phone, consistently outperforming prior work.\n",
      "With the rise in edge-computing devices, there has been an increasing demand to deploy energy and resource-efficient models. A large body of research has been devoted to developing methods that can reduce the size of the model considerably without affecting the standard metrics such as top-1 accuracy. However, these pruning approaches tend to result in a significant mismatch in other metrics such as fairness across classes and explainability. To combat such misalignment, we propose a novel multi-part loss function inspired by the knowledge-distillation literature. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across different compression algorithms, architectures, tasks as well as datasets. In particular, we obtain up to $4.1\\times$ reduction in the number of prediction mismatches between the compressed and reference models, and up to $5.7\\times$ in cases where the reference model makes the correct prediction; all while making no changes to the compression algorithm, and minor modifications to the loss function. Furthermore, we demonstrate how inducing simple alignment between the predictions of the models naturally improves the alignment on other metrics including fairness and attributions. Our framework can thus serve as a simple plug-and-play component for compression algorithms in the future.\n",
      "This paper presents a novel pre-trained language models (PLM) compression approach based on the matrix product operator (short as MPO) from quantum many-body physics. It can decompose an original matrix into central tensors (containing the core information) and auxiliary tensors (with only a small proportion of parameters). With the decomposed MPO structure, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy by only updating the parameters from the auxiliary tensors, and design an optimization algorithm for MPO-based approximation over stacked network architectures. Our approach can be applied to the original or the compressed PLMs in a general way, which derives a lighter network and significantly reduces the parameters to be fine-tuned. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in model compression, especially the reduction in finetuning parameters (91% reduction on average).\n",
      "This work addresses the problem of optimizing communications between server and clients in federated learning (FL). Current sampling approaches in FL are either biased, or non optimal in terms of server-clients communications and training stability. To overcome this issue, we introduce \\textit{clustered sampling} for clients selection. We prove that clustered sampling leads to better clients representatitivity and to reduced variance of the clients stochastic aggregation weights in FL. Compatibly with our theory, we provide two different clustering approaches enabling clients aggregation based on 1) sample size, and 2) models similarity. Through a series of experiments in non-iid and unbalanced scenarios, we demonstrate that model aggregation through clustered sampling consistently leads to better training convergence and variability when compared to standard sampling approaches. Our approach does not require any additional operation on the clients side, and can be seamlessly integrated in standard FL implementations. Finally, clustered sampling is compatible with existing methods and technologies for privacy enhancement, and for communication reduction through model compression.\n",
      "Interpretability of intelligent algorithms represented by deep learning has been yet an open problem. We discuss the shortcomings of the existing explainable method based on the two attributes of explanation, which are called completeness and explicitness. Furthermore, we point out that a model that completely relies on feed-forward mapping is extremely easy to cause inexplicability because it is hard to quantify the relationship between this mapping and the final model. Based on the perspective of the data space division, the principle of complete local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (CLIMEP) is proposed in this paper. To study the classification problems, we further discussed the equivalence of the CLIMEP and the decision boundary. As a matter of fact, it is also difficult to implementation of CLIMEP. To tackle the challenge, motivated by the fact that a fully-connected neural network (FCNN) with piece-wise linear activation functions (PWLs) can partition the input space into several linear regions, we extend this result to arbitrary FCNNs by the strategy of linearizing the activation functions. Applying this technique to solving classification problems, it is the first time that the complete decision boundary of FCNNs has been able to be obtained. Finally, we propose the DecisionNet (DNet), which divides the input space by the hyper-planes of the decision boundary. Hence, each linear interval of the DNet merely contains samples of the same label. Experiments show that the surprising model compression efficiency of the DNet with an arbitrary controlled precision.\n",
      "While model compression is increasingly important because of large neural network size, compression-aware training is challenging as it needs sophisticated model modifications and longer training time.In this paper, we introduce regularization frequency (i.e., how often compression is performed during training) as a new regularization technique for a practical and efficient compression-aware training method. For various regularization techniques, such as weight decay and dropout, optimizing the regularization strength is crucial to improve generalization in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). While model compression also demands the right amount of regularization, the regularization strength incurred by model compression has been controlled only by compression ratio. Throughout various experiments, we show that regularization frequency critically affects the regularization strength of model compression. Combining regularization frequency and compression ratio, the amount of weight updates by model compression per mini-batch can be optimized to achieve the best model accuracy. Modulating regularization frequency is implemented by occasional model compression while conventional compression-aware training is usually performed for every mini-batch.\n",
      "Factorized layers--operations parameterized by products of two or more matrices--occur in a variety of deep learning contexts, including compressed model training, certain types of knowledge distillation, and multi-head self-attention architectures. We study how to initialize and regularize deep nets containing such layers, examining two simple, understudied schemes, spectral initialization and Frobenius decay, for improving their performance. The guiding insight is to design optimization routines for these networks that are as close as possible to that of their well-tuned, non-decomposed counterparts; we back this intuition with an analysis of how the initialization and regularization schemes impact training with gradient descent, drawing on modern attempts to understand the interplay of weight-decay and batch-normalization. Empirically, we highlight the benefits of spectral initialization and Frobenius decay across a variety of settings. In model compression, we show that they enable low-rank methods to significantly outperform both unstructured sparsity and tensor methods on the task of training low-memory residual networks; analogs of the schemes also improve the performance of tensor decomposition techniques. For knowledge distillation, Frobenius decay enables a simple, overcomplete baseline that yields a compact model from over-parameterized training without requiring retraining with or pruning a teacher network. Finally, we show how both schemes applied to multi-head attention lead to improved performance on both translation and unsupervised pre-training.\n",
      "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown great success in completing complex tasks. However, DNNs inevitably bring high computational cost and storage consumption due to the complexity of hierarchical structures, thereby hindering their wide deployment in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, which have limited computational capability and storage capacity. Therefore, it is a necessity to investigate the technologies to compact DNNs. Despite tremendous advances in compacting DNNs, few surveys summarize compacting-DNNs technologies, especially for IoT applications. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive study on compacting-DNNs technologies. We categorize compacting-DNNs technologies into three major types: 1) network model compression, 2) Knowledge Distillation (KD), 3) modification of network structures. We also elaborate on the diversity of these approaches and make side-by-side comparisons. Moreover, we discuss the applications of compacted DNNs in various IoT applications and outline future directions.\n",
      "Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a model-agnostic technique to improve model quality while having a fixed capacity budget. It is a commonly used technique for model compression, where a larger capacity teacher model with better quality is used to train a more compact student model with better inference efficiency. Through distillation, one hopes to benefit from student's compactness, without sacrificing too much on model quality. Despite the large success of knowledge distillation, better understanding of how it benefits student model's training dynamics remains under-explored. In this paper, we categorize teacher's knowledge into three hierarchical levels and study its effects on knowledge distillation: (1) knowledge of the `universe', where KD brings a regularization effect through label smoothing; (2) domain knowledge, where teacher injects class relationships prior to student's logit layer geometry; and (3) instance specific knowledge, where teacher rescales student model's per-instance gradients based on its measurement on the event difficulty. Using systematic analyses and extensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we confirm that the aforementioned three factors play a major role in knowledge distillation. Furthermore, based on our findings, we diagnose some of the failure cases of applying KD from recent studies.\n",
      "Knowledge distillation has demonstrated encouraging performances in deep model compression. Most existing approaches, however, require massive labeled data to accomplish the knowledge transfer, making the model compression a cumbersome and costly process. In this paper, we investigate the practical few-shot knowledge distillation scenario, where we assume only a few samples without human annotations are available for each category. To this end, we introduce a principled dual-stage distillation scheme tailored for few-shot data. In the first step, we graft the student blocks one by one onto the teacher, and learn the parameters of the grafted block intertwined with those of the other teacher blocks. In the second step, the trained student blocks are progressively connected and then together grafted onto the teacher network, allowing the learned student blocks to adapt themselves to each other and eventually replace the teacher network. Experiments demonstrate that our approach, with only a few unlabeled samples, achieves gratifying results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ILSVRC-2012. On CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, our performances are even on par with those of knowledge distillation schemes that utilize the full datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/zju-vipa/NetGraft.\n",
      "Several methods of knowledge distillation have been developed for neural network compression. While they all use the KL divergence loss to align the soft outputs of the student model more closely with that of the teacher, the various methods differ in how the intermediate features of the student are encouraged to match those of the teacher. In this paper, we propose a simple-to-implement method using auxiliary classifiers at intermediate layers for matching features, which we refer to as multi-head knowledge distillation (MHKD). We add loss terms for training the student that measure the dissimilarity between student and teacher outputs of the auxiliary classifiers. At the same time, the proposed method also provides a natural way to measure differences at the intermediate layers even though the dimensions of the internal teacher and student features may be different. Through several experiments in image classification on multiple datasets we show that the proposed method outperforms prior relevant approaches presented in the literature.\n",
      "This paper aims to provide a selective survey about knowledge distillation(KD) framework for researchers and practitioners to take advantage of it for developing new optimized models in the deep neural network field. To this end, we give a brief overview of knowledge distillation and some related works including learning using privileged information(LUPI) and generalized distillation(GD). Even though knowledge distillation based on the teacher-student architecture was initially devised as a model compression technique, it has found versatile applications over various frameworks.   In this paper, we review the characteristics of knowledge distillation from the hypothesis that the three important ingredients of knowledge distillation are distilled knowledge and loss,teacher-student paradigm, and the distillation process. In addition, we survey the versatility of the knowledge distillation by studying its direct applications and its usage in combination with other deep learning paradigms. Finally we present some future works in knowledge distillation including explainable knowledge distillation where the analytical analysis of the performance gain is studied and the self-supervised learning which is a hot research topic in deep learning community.\n",
      "Edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning for nowadays, are gradually intersecting to build a novel system, called edge intelligence. However, the development of edge intelligence systems encounters some challenges, and one of these challenges is the \\textit{computational gap} between computation-intensive deep learning algorithms and less-capable edge systems. Due to the computational gap, many edge intelligence systems cannot meet the expected performance requirements. To bridge the gap, a plethora of deep learning techniques and optimization methods are proposed in the past years: light-weight deep learning models, network compression, and efficient neural architecture search. Although some reviews or surveys have partially covered this large body of literature, we lack a systematic and comprehensive review to discuss all aspects of these deep learning techniques which are critical for edge intelligence implementation. As various and diverse methods which are applicable to edge systems are proposed intensively, a holistic review would enable edge computing engineers and community to know the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques which are instrumental for edge intelligence and to facilitate the development of edge intelligence systems. This paper surveys the representative and latest deep learning techniques that are useful for edge intelligence systems, including hand-crafted models, model compression, hardware-aware neural architecture search and adaptive deep learning models.

      "Knowledge distillation is a strategy of training a student network with guide of the soft output from a teacher network. It has been a successful method of model compression and knowledge transfer. However, currently knowledge distillation lacks a convincing theoretical understanding. On the other hand, recent finding on neural tangent kernel enables us to approximate a wide neural network with a linear model of the network's random features. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the knowledge distillation of a wide neural network. First we provide a transfer risk bound for the linearized model of the network. Then we propose a metric of the task's training difficulty, called data inefficiency. Based on this metric, we show that for a perfect teacher, a high ratio of teacher's soft labels can be beneficial. Finally, for the case of imperfect teacher, we find that hard labels can correct teacher's wrong prediction, which explains the practice of mixing hard and soft labels.\n",
      "Model compression is crucial for deployment of neural networks on devices with limited computational and memory resources. Many different methods show comparable accuracy of the compressed model and similar compression rates. However, the majority of the compression methods are based on heuristics and offer no worst-case guarantees on the trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error for an arbitrarily new sample. We propose the first efficient structured pruning algorithm with a provable trade-off between its compression rate and the approximation error for any future test sample. Our method is based on the coreset framework and it approximates the output of a layer of neurons/filters by a coreset of neurons/filters in the previous layer and discards the rest. We apply this framework in a layer-by-layer fashion from the bottom to the top. Unlike previous works, our coreset is data independent, meaning that it provably guarantees the accuracy of the function for any input $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, including an adversarial one.\n",
      "Large deep neural network (DNN) models pose the key challenge to energy efficiency due to the significantly higher energy consumption of off-chip DRAM accesses than arithmetic or SRAM operations. It motivates the intensive research on model compression with two main approaches. Weight pruning leverages the redundancy in the number of weights and can be performed in a non-structured, which has higher flexibility and pruning rate but incurs index accesses due to irregular weights, or structured manner, which preserves the full matrix structure with lower pruning rate. Weight quantization leverages the redundancy in the number of bits in weights. Compared to pruning, quantization is much more hardware-friendly, and has become a \"must-do\" step for FPGA and ASIC implementations. This paper provides a definitive answer to the question for the first time. First, we build ADMM-NN-S by extending and enhancing ADMM-NN, a recently proposed joint weight pruning and quantization framework. Second, we develop a methodology for fair and fundamental comparison of non-structured and structured pruning in terms of both storage and computation efficiency. Our results show that ADMM-NN-S consistently outperforms the prior art: (i) it achieves 348x, 36x, and 8x overall weight pruning on LeNet-5, AlexNet, and ResNet-50, respectively, with (almost) zero accuracy loss; (ii) we demonstrate the first fully binarized (for all layers) DNNs can be lossless in accuracy in many cases. These results provide a strong baseline and credibility of our study. Based on the proposed comparison framework, with the same accuracy and quantization, the results show that non-structrued pruning is not competitive in terms of both storage and computation efficiency. Thus, we conclude that non-structured pruning is considered harmful. We urge the community not to continue the DNN inference acceleration for non-structured sparsity.\n",
      "Knowledge distillation is a widely used technique for model compression. We posit that the teacher model used in a distillation setup, captures relationships between classes, that extend beyond the original dataset. We empirically show that a teacher model can transfer this knowledge to a student model even on an {\\it out-of-distribution} dataset. Using this approach, we show promising results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Caltech-256 datasets using unlabeled image data from different sources. Our results are encouraging and help shed further light from the perspective of understanding knowledge distillation and utilizing unlabeled data to improve model quality.\n",
      "End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are increasingly large and complex to achieve the best possible accuracy. In this paper, we build an AutoML system that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the per-layer compression ratios when applied to a state-of-the-art attention based end-to-end ASR model composed of several LSTM layers. We use singular value decomposition (SVD) low-rank matrix factorization as the compression method. For our RL-based AutoML system, we focus on practical considerations such as the choice of the reward/punishment functions, the formation of an effective search space, and the creation of a representative but small data set for quick evaluation between search steps. Finally, we present accuracy results on LibriSpeech of the model compressed by our AutoML system, and we compare it to manually-compressed models. Our results show that in the absence of retraining our RL-based search is an effective and practical method to compress a production-grade ASR system. When retraining is possible, we show that our AutoML system can select better highly-compressed seed models compared to manually hand-crafted rank selection, thus allowing for more compression than previously possible.\n",
      "Structured weight pruning is a representative model compression technique of DNNs to reduce the storage and computation requirements and accelerate inference. An automatic hyperparameter determination process is necessary due to the large number of flexible hyperparameters. This work proposes AutoCompress, an automatic structured pruning framework with the following key performance improvements: (i) effectively incorporate the combination of structured pruning schemes in the automatic process; (ii) adopt the state-of-art ADMM-based structured weight pruning as the core algorithm, and propose an innovative additional purification step for further weight reduction without accuracy loss; and (iii) develop effective heuristic search method enhanced by experience-based guided search, replacing the prior deep reinforcement learning technique which has underlying incompatibility with the target pruning problem. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that AutoCompress is the key to achieve ultra-high pruning rates on the number of weights and FLOPs that cannot be achieved before. As an example, AutoCompress outperforms the prior work on automatic model compression by up to 33x in pruning rate (120x reduction in the actual parameter count) under the same accuracy. Significant inference speedup has been observed from the AutoCompress framework on actual measurements on smartphone. We release all models of this work at anonymous link: http://bit.ly/2VZ63dS.\n",
      "While convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved impressive performance on various classification/recognition tasks, they typically consist of a massive number of parameters. This results in significant memory requirement as well as computational overheads. Consequently, there is a growing need for filter-level pruning approaches for compressing CNN based models that not only reduce the total number of parameters but reduce the overall computation as well. We present a new min-max framework for filter-level pruning of CNNs. Our framework, called Play and Prune (PP), jointly prunes and fine-tunes CNN model parameters, with an adaptive pruning rate, while maintaining the model's predictive performance. Our framework consists of two modules: (1) An adaptive filter pruning (AFP) module, which minimizes the number of filters in the model; and (2) A pruning rate controller (PRC) module, which maximizes the accuracy during pruning. Moreover, unlike most previous approaches, our approach allows directly specifying the desired error tolerance instead of pruning level. Our compressed models can be deployed at run-time, without requiring any special libraries or hardware. Our approach reduces the number of parameters of VGG-16 by an impressive factor of 17.5X, and number of FLOPS by 6.43X, with no loss of accuracy, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art filter pruning methods.\n",
      "Deep neural networks have become commonplace in the domain of reinforcement learning, but are often expensive in terms of the number of parameters needed. While compressing deep neural networks has of late assumed great importance to overcome this drawback, little work has been done to address this problem in the context of reinforcement learning agents. This work aims at making first steps towards model compression in an RL agent. In particular, we compress networks to drastically reduce the number of parameters in them (to sizes less than 3% of their original size), further facilitated by applying a global max pool after the final convolution layer, and propose using Actor-Mimic in the context of compression. Finally, we show that this global max-pool allows for weakly supervised object localization, improving the ability to identify the agent's points of focus.\n",
      "This paper is on improving the training of binary neural networks in which both activations and weights are binary. While prior methods for neural network binarization binarize each filter independently, we propose to instead parametrize the weight tensor of each layer using matrix or tensor decomposition. The binarization process is then performed using this latent parametrization, via a quantization function (e.g. sign function) applied to the reconstructed weights. A key feature of our method is that while the reconstruction is binarized, the computation in the latent factorized space is done in the real domain. This has several advantages: (i) the latent factorization enforces a coupling of the filters before binarization, which significantly improves the accuracy of the trained models. (ii) while at training time, the binary weights of each convolutional layer are parametrized using real-valued matrix or tensor decomposition, during inference we simply use the reconstructed (binary) weights. As a result, our method does not sacrifice any advantage of binary networks in terms of model compression and speeding-up inference. As a further contribution, instead of computing the binary weight scaling factors analytically, as in prior work, we propose to learn them discriminatively via back-propagation. Finally, we show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods when tested on the challenging tasks of (a) human pose estimation (more than 4% improvements) and (b) ImageNet classification (up to 5% performance gains).\n",
      "Machine learning models have become more and more complex in order to better approximate complex functions. Although fruitful in many domains, the added complexity has come at the cost of model interpretability. The once popular k-nearest neighbors (kNN) approach, which finds and uses the most similar data for reasoning, has received much less attention in recent decades due to numerous problems when compared to other techniques. We show that many of these historical problems with kNN can be overcome, and our contribution has applications not only in machine learning but also in online learning, data synthesis, anomaly detection, model compression, and reinforcement learning, without sacrificing interpretability. We introduce a synthesis between kNN and information theory that we hope will provide a clear path towards models that are innately interpretable and auditable. Through this work we hope to gather interest in combining kNN with information theory as a promising path to fully auditable machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n",
      "To facilitate efficient embedded and hardware implementations of deep neural networks (DNNs), two important categories of DNN model compression techniques: weight pruning and weight quantization are investigated. The former leverages the redundancy in the number of weights, whereas the latter leverages the redundancy in bit representation of weights. However, there lacks a systematic framework of joint weight pruning and quantization of DNNs, thereby limiting the available model compression ratio. Moreover, the computation reduction, energy efficiency improvement, and hardware performance overhead need to be accounted for besides simply model size reduction.   To address these limitations, we present ADMM-NN, the first algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework of DNNs using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a powerful technique to deal with non-convex optimization problems with possibly combinatorial constraints. The first part of ADMM-NN is a systematic, joint framework of DNN weight pruning and quantization using ADMM. It can be understood as a smart regularization technique with regularization target dynamically updated in each ADMM iteration, thereby resulting in higher performance in model compression than prior work. The second part is hardware-aware DNN optimizations to facilitate hardware-level implementations.   Without accuracy loss, we can achieve 85$\\times$ and 24$\\times$ pruning on LeNet-5 and AlexNet models, respectively, significantly higher than prior work. The improvement becomes more significant when focusing on computation reductions. Combining weight pruning and quantization, we achieve 1,910$\\times$ and 231$\\times$ reductions in overall model size on these two benchmarks, when focusing on data storage. Highly promising results are also observed on other representative DNNs such as VGGNet and ResNet-50.\n",
      "In order to save the memory, we propose a miniaturization method for neural network to reduce the parameter quantity existed in remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation model. The compact convolution optimization method is first used for standard U-Net to reduce the weights quantity. With the purpose of decreasing model performance loss caused by miniaturization and based on the characteristics of remote sensing image, fewer down-samplings and improved cascade atrous convolution are then used to improve the performance of the miniaturized U-Net. Compared with U-Net, our proposed Micro-Net not only achieves 29.26 times model compression, but also basically maintains the performance unchanged on the public dataset. We provide a Keras and Tensorflow hybrid programming implementation for our model: https://github.com/Isnot2bad/Micro-Net\n",
      "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a popular method for reducing the computational overhead of deep network inference, in which the output of a teacher model is used to train a smaller, faster student model. Hint training (i.e., FitNets) extends KD by regressing a student model's intermediate representation to a teacher model's intermediate representation. In this work, we introduce bLock-wise Intermediate representation Training (LIT), a novel model compression technique that extends the use of intermediate representations in deep network compression, outperforming KD and hint training. LIT has two key ideas: 1) LIT trains a student of the same width (but shallower depth) as the teacher by directly comparing the intermediate representations, and 2) LIT uses the intermediate representation from the previous block in the teacher model as an input to the current student block during training, avoiding unstable intermediate representations in the student network. We show that LIT provides substantial reductions in network depth without loss in accuracy -- for example, LIT can compress a ResNeXt-110 to a ResNeXt-20 (5.5x) on CIFAR10 and a VDCNN-29 to a VDCNN-9 (3.2x) on Amazon Reviews without loss in accuracy, outperforming KD and hint training in network size for a given accuracy. We also show that applying LIT to identical student/teacher architectures increases the accuracy of the student model above the teacher model, outperforming the recently-proposed Born Again Networks procedure on ResNet, ResNeXt, and VDCNN. Finally, we show that LIT can effectively compress GAN generators, which are not supported in the KD framework because GANs output pixels as opposed to probabilities.\n",
      "Deep neural networks have achieved increasingly accurate results on a wide variety of complex tasks. However, much of this improvement is due to the growing use and availability of computational resources (e.g use of GPUs, more layers, more parameters, etc). Most state-of-the-art deep networks, despite performing well, over-parameterize approximate functions and take a significant amount of time to train. With increased focus on deploying deep neural networks on resource constrained devices like smart phones, there has been a push to evaluate why these models are so resource hungry and how they can be made more efficient. This work evaluates and compares three distinct methods for deep model compression and acceleration: weight pruning, low rank factorization, and knowledge distillation. Comparisons on VGG nets trained on CIFAR10 show that each of the models on their own are effective, but that the true power lies in combining them. We show that by combining pruning and knowledge distillation methods we can create a compressed network 85 times smaller than the original, all while retaining 96% of the original model's accuracy.\n",
      "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the state-of-the-art technique for machine learning tasks in various applications. However, due to their size and the computational complexity, large DNNs are not readily deployable on edge devices in real-time. To manage complexity and accelerate computation, network compression techniques based on pruning and quantization have been proposed and shown to be effective in reducing network size. However, such network compression can result in irregular matrix structures that are mismatched with modern hardware-accelerated platforms, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) designed to perform the DNN matrix multiplications in a structured (block-based) way. We propose MPDCompress, a DNN compression algorithm based on matrix permutation decomposition via random mask generation. In-training application of the masks molds the synaptic weight connection matrix to a sub-graph separation format. Aided by the random permutations, a hardware-desirable block matrix is generated, allowing for a more efficient implementation and compression of the network. To show versatility, we empirically verify MPDCompress on several network models, compression rates, and image datasets. On the LeNet 300-100 model (MNIST dataset), Deep MNIST, and CIFAR10, we achieve 10 X network compression with less than 1% accuracy loss compared to non-compressed accuracy performance. On AlexNet for the full ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset, we achieve 8 X network compression with less than 1% accuracy loss, with top-5 and top-1 accuracies of 79.6% and 56.4%, respectively. Finally, we observe that the algorithm can offer inference speedups across various hardware platforms, with 4 X faster operation achieved on several mobile GPUs.\n",
      "Model compression is significant for the wide adoption of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in both user devices possessing limited resources and business clusters requiring quick responses to large-scale service requests. This work aims to learn structurally-sparse Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) by reducing the sizes of basic structures within LSTM units, including input updates, gates, hidden states, cell states and outputs. Independently reducing the sizes of basic structures can result in inconsistent dimensions among them, and consequently, end up with invalid LSTM units. To overcome the problem, we propose Intrinsic Sparse Structures (ISS) in LSTMs. Removing a component of ISS will simultaneously decrease the sizes of all basic structures by one and thereby always maintain the dimension consistency. By learning ISS within LSTM units, the obtained LSTMs remain regular while having much smaller basic structures. Based on group Lasso regularization, our method achieves 10.59x speedup without losing any perplexity of a language modeling of Penn TreeBank dataset. It is also successfully evaluated through a compact model with only 2.69M weights for machine Question Answering of SQuAD dataset. Our approach is successfully extended to non- LSTM RNNs, like Recurrent Highway Networks (RHNs). Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wenwei202/iss-rnns\n",
      "Recently, DNN model compression based on network architecture design, e.g., SqueezeNet, attracted a lot attention. No accuracy drop on image classification is observed on these extremely compact networks, compared to well-known models. An emerging question, however, is whether these model compression techniques hurt DNN's learning ability other than classifying images on a single dataset. Our preliminary experiment shows that these compression methods could degrade domain adaptation (DA) ability, though the classification performance is preserved. Therefore, we propose a new compact network architecture and unsupervised DA method in this paper. The DNN is built on a new basic module Conv-M which provides more diverse feature extractors without significantly increasing parameters. The unified framework of our DA method will simultaneously learn invariance across domains, reduce divergence of feature representations, and adapt label prediction. Our DNN has 4.1M parameters, which is only 6.7% of AlexNet or 59% of GoogLeNet. Experiments show that our DNN obtains GoogLeNet-level accuracy both on classification and DA, and our DA method slightly outperforms previous competitive ones. Put all together, our DA strategy based on our DNN achieves state-of-the-art on sixteen of total eighteen DA tasks on popular Office-31 and Office-Caltech datasets.\n",
      "Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet).   The SqueezeNet architecture is available for download here: https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet\n",
      "We introduce a new type of programming challenge called programming puzzles, as an objective and comprehensive evaluation of program synthesis, and release an open-source dataset of Python Programming Puzzles (P3). Each puzzle is defined by a short Python program $f$, and the goal is to find an input $x$ which makes $f$ output \"True\". The puzzles are objective in that each one is specified entirely by the source code of its verifier $f$, so evaluating $f(x)$ is all that is needed to test a candidate solution $x$. They do not require an answer key or input/output examples, nor do they depend on natural language understanding. The dataset is comprehensive in that it spans problems of a range of difficulties and domains, ranging from trivial string manipulation problems that are immediately obvious to human programmers (but not necessarily to AI), to classic programming puzzles (e.g., Towers of Hanoi), to interview/competitive-programming problems (e.g., dynamic programming), to longstanding open problems in algorithms and mathematics (e.g., factoring). The objective nature of P3 readily supports self-supervised bootstrapping. We develop baseline enumerative program synthesis and GPT-3 solvers that are capable of solving easy puzzles -- even without access to any reference solutions -- by learning from their own past solutions. Based on a small user study, we find puzzle difficulty to correlate between human programmers and the baseline AI solvers.\n",
      "Temporal sentence grounding in videos(TSGV), which aims to localize one target segment from an untrimmed video with respect to a given sentence query, has drawn increasing attentions in the research community over the past few years. Different from the task of temporal action localization, TSGV is more flexible since it can locate complicated activities via natural languages, without restrictions from predefined action categories. Meanwhile, TSGV is more challenging since it requires both textual and visual understanding for semantic alignment between two modalities(i.e., text and video). In this survey, we give a comprehensive overview for TSGV, which i) summarizes the taxonomy of existing methods, ii) provides a detailed description of the evaluation protocols(i.e., datasets and metrics) to be used in TSGV, and iii) in-depth discusses potential problems of current benchmarking designs and research directions for further investigations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic survey on temporal sentence grounding. More specifically, we first discuss existing TSGV approaches by grouping them into four categories, i.e., two-stage methods, end-to-end methods, reinforcement learning-based methods, and weakly supervised methods. Then we present the benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics to assess current research progress. Finally, we discuss some limitations in TSGV through pointing out potential problems improperly resolved in the current evaluation protocols, which may push forwards more cutting edge research in TSGV. Besides, we also share our insights on several promising directions, including three typical tasks with new and practical settings based on TSGV.\n",
      "Estimating the performance of a machine learning system is a longstanding challenge in artificial intelligence research. Today, this challenge is especially relevant given the emergence of systems which appear to increasingly outperform human beings. In some cases, this \"superhuman\" performance is readily demonstrated; for example by defeating legendary human players in traditional two player games. On the other hand, it can be challenging to evaluate classification models that potentially surpass human performance. Indeed, human annotations are often treated as a ground truth, which implicitly assumes the superiority of the human over any models trained on human annotations. In reality, human annotators can make mistakes and be subjective. Evaluating the performance with respect to a genuine oracle may be more objective and reliable, even when querying the oracle is expensive or impossible. In this paper, we first raise the challenge of evaluating the performance of both humans and models with respect to an oracle which is unobserved. We develop a theory for estimating the accuracy compared to the oracle, using only imperfect human annotations for reference. Our analysis provides a simple recipe for detecting and certifying superhuman performance in this setting, which we believe will assist in understanding the stage of current research on classification. We validate the convergence of the bounds and the assumptions of our theory on carefully designed toy experiments with known oracles. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by meta-analyzing large-scale natural language processing tasks, for which an oracle does not exist, and show that under our assumptions a number of models from recent years are with high probability superhuman.\n",
      "Term weighting schemes are widely used in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. In particular, term weighting is the basis for keyword extraction. However, there are relatively few evaluation studies that shed light about the strengths and shortcomings of each weighting scheme. In fact, in most cases researchers and practitioners resort to the well-known tf-idf as default, despite the existence of other suitable alternatives, including graph-based models. In this paper, we perform an exhaustive and large-scale empirical comparison of both statistical and graph-based term weighting methods in the context of keyword extraction. Our analysis reveals some interesting findings such as the advantages of the less-known lexical specificity with respect to tf-idf, or the qualitative differences between statistical and graph-based methods. Finally, based on our findings we discuss and devise some suggestions for practitioners. Source code to reproduce our experimental results, including a keyword extraction library, are available in the following repository: https://github.com/asahi417/kex\n",
      "The progress of some AI paradigms such as deep learning is said to be linked to an exponential growth in the number of parameters. There are many studies corroborating these trends, but does this translate into an exponential increase in energy consumption? In order to answer this question we focus on inference costs rather than training costs, as the former account for most of the computing effort, solely because of the multiplicative factors. Also, apart from algorithmic innovations, we account for more specific and powerful hardware (leading to higher FLOPS) that is usually accompanied with important energy efficiency optimisations. We also move the focus from the first implementation of a breakthrough paper towards the consolidated version of the techniques one or two year later. Under this distinctive and comprehensive perspective, we study relevant models in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing: for a sustained increase in performance we see a much softer growth in energy consumption than previously anticipated. The only caveat is, yet again, the multiplicative factor, as future AI increases penetration and becomes more pervasive.\n",
      "Temporal grounding aims to predict a time interval of a video clip corresponding to a natural language query input. In this work, we present EVOQUER, a temporal grounding framework incorporating an existing text-to-video grounding model and a video-assisted query generation network. Given a query and an untrimmed video, the temporal grounding model predicts the target interval, and the predicted video clip is fed into a video translation task by generating a simplified version of the input query. EVOQUER forms closed-loop learning by incorporating loss functions from both temporal grounding and query generation serving as feedback. Our experiments on two widely used datasets, Charades-STA and ActivityNet, show that EVOQUER achieves promising improvements by 1.05 and 1.31 at R@0.7. We also discuss how the query generation task could facilitate error analysis by explaining temporal grounding model behavior.\n",
      "In the last decade or so, we have witnessed deep learning reinvigorating the machine learning field. It has solved many problems in the domains of computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and various other tasks with state-of-the-art performance. The data is generally represented in the Euclidean space in these domains. Various other domains conform to non-Euclidean space, for which graph is an ideal representation. Graphs are suitable for representing the dependencies and interrelationships between various entities. Traditionally, handcrafted features for graphs are incapable of providing the necessary inference for various tasks from this complex data representation. Recently, there is an emergence of employing various advances in deep learning to graph data-based tasks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of graph neural networks (GNNs) in each learning setting: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised learning. Taxonomy of each graph based learning setting is provided with logical divisions of methods falling in the given learning setting. The approaches for each learning task are analyzed from both theoretical as well as empirical standpoints. Further, we provide general architecture guidelines for building GNNs. Various applications and benchmark datasets are also provided, along with open challenges still plaguing the general applicability of GNNs.\n",
      "Adversarial training has been proven to be a powerful regularization method to improve the generalization of models. However, current adversarial training methods only attack the original input sample or the embedding vectors, and their attacks lack coverage and diversity. To further enhance the breadth and depth of attack, we propose a novel masked weight adversarial training method called DropAttack, which enhances generalization of model by adding intentionally worst-case adversarial perturbations to both the input and hidden layers in different dimensions and minimize the adversarial risks generated by each layer. DropAttack is a general technique and can be adopt to a wide variety of neural networks with different architectures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we used five public datasets in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) for experimental evaluating. We compare the proposed method with other adversarial training methods and regularization methods, and our method achieves state-of-the-art on all datasets. In addition, Dropattack can achieve the same performance when it use only a half training data compared to other standard training method. Theoretical analysis reveals that DropAttack can perform gradient regularization at random on some of the input and wight parameters of the model. Further visualization experiments show that DropAttack can push the minimum risk of the model to a lower and flatter loss landscapes. Our source code is publicly available on https://github.com/nishiwen1214/DropAttack.\n",

MADGRAD shows excellent performance on deep learning optimization problems from multiple fields, including classification and image-to-image tasks in vision, and recurrent and bidirectionally-masked models in natural language processing. For each of these tasks, MADGRAD matches or outperforms both SGD and ADAM in test set performance, even on problems for which adaptive methods normally perform poorly.\n",
      "Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) aims to enable embodied agents to navigate in realistic environments using natural language instructions. Given the scarcity of domain-specific training data and the high diversity of image and language inputs, the generalization of VLN agents to unseen environments remains challenging. Recent methods explore pretraining to improve generalization, however, the use of generic image-caption datasets or existing small-scale VLN environments is suboptimal and results in limited improvements. In this work, we introduce BnB, a large-scale and diverse in-domain VLN dataset. We first collect image-caption (IC) pairs from hundreds of thousands of listings from online rental marketplaces. Using IC pairs we next propose automatic strategies to generate millions of VLN path-instruction (PI) pairs. We further propose a shuffling loss that improves the learning of temporal order inside PI pairs. We use BnB pretrain our Airbert model that can be adapted to discriminative and generative settings and show that it outperforms state of the art for Room-to-Room (R2R) navigation and Remote Referring Expression (REVERIE) benchmarks. Moreover, our in-domain pretraining significantly increases performance on a challenging few-shot VLN evaluation, where we train the model only on VLN instructions from a few houses.\n",
      "Data processing and analytics are fundamental and pervasive. Algorithms play a vital role in data processing and analytics where many algorithm designs have incorporated heuristics and general rules from human knowledge and experience to improve their effectiveness. Recently, reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in particular, is increasingly explored and exploited in many areas because it can learn better strategies in complicated environments it is interacting with than statically designed algorithms. Motivated by this trend, we provide a comprehensive review of recent works focusing on utilizing deep reinforcement learning to improve data processing and analytics. First, we present an introduction to key concepts, theories, and methods in deep reinforcement learning. Next, we discuss deep reinforcement learning deployment on database systems, facilitating data processing and analytics in various aspects, including data organization, scheduling, tuning, and indexing. Then, we survey the application of deep reinforcement learning in data processing and analytics, ranging from data preparation, natural language interface to healthcare, fintech, etc. Finally, we discuss important open challenges and future research directions of using deep reinforcement learning in data processing and analytics.\n",
      "Recently, there have been breakthroughs in computer vision (\"CV\") models that are more generalizable with the advent of models such as CLIP and ALIGN. In this paper, we analyze CLIP and highlight some of the challenges such models pose. CLIP reduces the need for task specific training data, potentially opening up many niche tasks to automation. CLIP also allows its users to flexibly specify image classification classes in natural language, which we find can shift how biases manifest. Additionally, through some preliminary probes we find that CLIP can inherit biases found in prior computer vision systems. Given the wide and unpredictable domain of uses for such models, this raises questions regarding what sufficiently safe behaviour for such systems may look like. These results add evidence to the growing body of work calling for a change in the notion of a 'better' model--to move beyond simply looking at higher accuracy at task-oriented capability evaluations, and towards a broader 'better' that takes into account deployment-critical features such as different use contexts, and people who interact with the model when thinking about model deployment.\n",
      "Deep learning has achieved great success in a wide spectrum of multimedia applications such as image classification, natural language processing and multimodal data analysis. Recent years have seen the development of many deep learning frameworks that provide a high-level programming interface for users to design models, conduct training and deploy inference. However, it remains challenging to build an efficient end-to-end multimedia application with most existing frameworks. Specifically, in terms of usability, it is demanding for non-experts to implement deep learning models, obtain the right settings for the entire machine learning pipeline, manage models and datasets, and exploit external data sources all together. Further, in terms of adaptability, elastic computation solutions are much needed as the actual serving workload fluctuates constantly, and scaling the hardware resources to handle the fluctuating workload is typically infeasible. To address these challenges, we introduce SINGA-Easy, a new deep learning framework that provides distributed hyper-parameter tuning at the training stage, dynamic computational cost control at the inference stage, and intuitive user interactions with multimedia contents facilitated by model explanation. Our experiments on the training and deployment of multi-modality data analysis applications show that the framework is both usable and adaptable to dynamic inference loads. We implement SINGA-Easy on top of Apache SINGA and demonstrate our system with the entire machine learning life cycle.\n",
      "Learning continuously during all model lifetime is fundamental to deploy machine learning solutions robust to drifts in the data distribution. Advances in Continual Learning (CL) with recurrent neural networks could pave the way to a large number of applications where incoming data is non stationary, like natural language processing and robotics. However, the existing body of work on the topic is still fragmented, with approaches which are application-specific and whose assessment is based on heterogeneous learning protocols and datasets. In this paper, we organize the literature on CL for sequential data processing by providing a categorization of the contributions and a review of the benchmarks. We propose two new benchmarks for CL with sequential data based on existing datasets, whose characteristics resemble real-world applications. We also provide a broad empirical evaluation of CL and Recurrent Neural Networks in class-incremental scenario, by testing their ability to mitigate forgetting with a number of different strategies which are not specific to sequential data processing. Our results highlight the key role played by the sequence length and the importance of a clear specification of the CL scenario.\n",
      "Despite the progress in automatic detection of radiologic findings from chest X-ray (CXR) images in recent years, a quantitative evaluation of the explainability of these models is hampered by the lack of locally labeled datasets for different findings. With the exception of a few expert-labeled small-scale datasets for specific findings, such as pneumonia and pneumothorax, most of the CXR deep learning models to date are trained on global \"weak\" labels extracted from text reports, or trained via a joint image and unstructured text learning strategy. Inspired by the Visual Genome effort in the computer vision community, we constructed the first Chest ImaGenome dataset with a scene graph data structure to describe $242,072$ images. Local annotations are automatically produced using a joint rule-based natural language processing (NLP) and atlas-based bounding box detection pipeline. Through a radiologist constructed CXR ontology, the annotations for each CXR are connected as an anatomy-centered scene graph, useful for image-level reasoning and multimodal fusion applications. Overall, we provide: i) $1,256$ combinations of relation annotations between $29$ CXR anatomical locations (objects with bounding box coordinates) and their attributes, structured as a scene graph per image, ii) over $670,000$ localized comparison relations (for improved, worsened, or no change) between the anatomical locations across sequential exams, as well as ii) a manually annotated gold standard scene graph dataset from $500$ unique patients.\n",
      "Gradient quantization is an emerging technique in reducing communication costs in distributed learning. Existing gradient quantization algorithms often rely on engineering heuristics or empirical observations, lacking a systematic approach to dynamically quantize gradients. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel dynamically quantized SGD (DQ-SGD) framework, enabling us to dynamically adjust the quantization scheme for each gradient descent step by exploring the trade-off between communication cost and convergence error. We derive an upper bound, tight in some cases, of the convergence error for a restricted family of quantization schemes and loss functions. We design our DQ-SGD algorithm via minimizing the communication cost under the convergence error constraints. Finally, through extensive experiments on large-scale natural language processing and computer vision tasks on AG-News, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, we demonstrate that our quantization scheme achieves better tradeoffs between the communication cost and learning performance than other state-of-the-art gradient quantization methods.\n",
      "Softmax classifiers with a very large number of classes naturally occur in many applications such as natural language processing and information retrieval. The calculation of full softmax is costly from the computational and energy perspective. There have been various sampling approaches to overcome this challenge, popularly known as negative sampling (NS). Ideally, NS should sample negative classes from a distribution that is dependent on the input data, the current parameters, and the correct positive class. Unfortunately, due to the dynamically updated parameters and data samples, there is no sampling scheme that is provably adaptive and samples the negative classes efficiently. Therefore, alternative heuristics like random sampling, static frequency-based sampling, or learning-based biased sampling, which primarily trade either the sampling cost or the adaptivity of samples per iteration are adopted. In this paper, we show two classes of distributions where the sampling scheme is truly adaptive and provably generates negative samples in near-constant time. Our implementation in C++ on CPU is significantly superior, both in terms of wall-clock time and accuracy, compared to the most optimized TensorFlow implementations of other popular negative sampling approaches on powerful NVIDIA V100 GPU.\n",
      "When humans solve complex problems, they rarely come up with a decision right-away. Instead, they start with an intuitive decision, reflect upon it, spot mistakes, resolve contradictions and jump between different hypotheses. Thus, they create a sequence of ideas and follow a train of thought that ultimately reaches a conclusive decision. Contrary to this, today's neural classification models are mostly trained to map an input to one single and fixed output. In this paper, we investigate how we can give models the opportunity of a second, third and $k$-th thought. We take inspiration from Hegel's dialectics and propose a method that turns an existing classifier's class prediction (such as the image class forest) into a sequence of predictions (such as forest $\\rightarrow$ tree $\\rightarrow$ mushroom). Concretely, we propose a correction module that is trained to estimate the model's correctness as well as an iterative prediction update based on the prediction's gradient. Our approach results in a dynamic system over class probability distributions $\\unicode{x2014}$ the thought flow. We evaluate our method on diverse datasets and tasks from computer vision and natural language processing. We observe surprisingly complex but intuitive behavior and demonstrate that our method (i) can correct misclassifications, (ii) strengthens model performance, (iii) is robust to high levels of adversarial attacks, (iv) can increase accuracy up to 4% in a label-distribution-shift setting and (iv) provides a tool for model interpretability that uncovers model knowledge which otherwise remains invisible in a single distribution prediction.\n",
      "Language instruction plays an essential role in the natural language grounded navigation tasks. However, navigators trained with limited human-annotated instructions may have difficulties in accurately capturing key information from the complicated instruction at different timesteps, leading to poor navigation performance. In this paper, we exploit to train a more robust navigator which is capable of dynamically extracting crucial factors from the long instruction, by using an adversarial attacking paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Reinforced Instruction Attacker (DR-Attacker), which learns to mislead the navigator to move to the wrong target by destroying the most instructive information in instructions at different timesteps. By formulating the perturbation generation as a Markov Decision Process, DR-Attacker is optimized by the reinforcement learning algorithm to generate perturbed instructions sequentially during the navigation, according to a learnable attack score. Then, the perturbed instructions, which serve as hard samples, are used for improving the robustness of the navigator with an effective adversarial training strategy and an auxiliary self-supervised reasoning task. Experimental results on both Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog History (NDH) tasks show the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the visualization analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed DR-Attacker, which can successfully attack crucial information in the instructions at different timesteps. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/DR-Attacker.\n",
      "Deep learning's success has been widely recognized in a variety of machine learning tasks, including image classification, audio recognition, and natural language processing. As an extension of deep learning beyond these domains, graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to handle the non-Euclidean graph-structure which is intractable to previous deep learning techniques. Existing GNNs are presented using various techniques, making direct comparison and cross-reference more complex. Although existing studies categorize GNNs into spatial-based and spectral-based techniques, there hasn't been a thorough examination of their relationship. To close this gap, this study presents a single framework that systematically incorporates most GNNs. We organize existing GNNs into spatial and spectral domains, as well as expose the connections within each domain. A review of spectral graph theory and approximation theory builds a strong relationship across the spatial and spectral domains in further investigation.\n",
      "Developing video understanding intelligence is quite challenging because it requires holistic integration of images, scripts, and sounds based on natural language processing, temporal dependency, and reasoning. Recently, substantial attempts have been made on several video datasets with associated question answering (QA) on a large scale. However, existing evaluation metrics for video question answering (VideoQA) do not provide meaningful analysis. To make progress, we argue that a well-made framework, established on the way humans understand, is required to explain and evaluate the performance of understanding in detail. Then we propose a top-down evaluation system for VideoQA, based on the cognitive process of humans and story elements: Cognitive Modules for Evaluation (CogME). CogME is composed of three cognitive modules: targets, contents, and thinking. The interaction among the modules in the understanding procedure can be expressed in one sentence as follows: \"I understand the CONTENT of the TARGET through a way of THINKING.\" Each module has sub-components derived from the story elements. We can specify the required aspects of understanding by annotating the sub-components to individual questions. CogME thus provides a framework for an elaborated specification of VideoQA datasets. To examine the suitability of a VideoQA dataset for validating video understanding intelligence, we evaluated the baseline model of the DramaQA dataset by applying CogME. The evaluation reveals that story elements are unevenly reflected in the existing dataset, and the model based on the dataset may cause biased predictions. Although this study has only been able to grasp a narrow range of stories, we expect that it offers the first step in considering the cognitive process of humans on the video understanding intelligence of humans and AI.\n",
      "We develop a novel approach to conformal prediction when the target task has limited data available for training. Conformal prediction identifies a small set of promising output candidates in place of a single prediction, with guarantees that the set contains the correct answer with high probability. When training data is limited, however, the predicted set can easily become unusably large. In this work, we obtain substantially tighter prediction sets while maintaining desirable marginal guarantees by casting conformal prediction as a meta-learning paradigm over exchangeable collections of auxiliary tasks. Our conformalization algorithm is simple, fast, and agnostic to the choice of underlying model, learning algorithm, or dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across a number of few-shot classification and regression tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and computational chemistry for drug discovery.\n",
      "Standard training via empirical risk minimization (ERM) can produce models that achieve high accuracy on average but low accuracy on certain groups, especially in the presence of spurious correlations between the input and label. Prior approaches that achieve high worst-group accuracy, like group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) require expensive group annotations for each training point, whereas approaches that do not use such group annotations typically achieve unsatisfactory worst-group accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple two-stage approach, JTT, that first trains a standard ERM model for several epochs, and then trains a second model that upweights the training examples that the first model misclassified. Intuitively, this upweights examples from groups on which standard ERM models perform poorly, leading to improved worst-group performance. Averaged over four image classification and natural language processing tasks with spurious correlations, JTT closes 75% of the gap in worst-group accuracy between standard ERM and group DRO, while only requiring group annotations on a small validation set in order to tune hyperparameters.\n",
      "Academic advances of AI models in high-precision domains, like healthcare, need to be made explainable in order to enhance real-world adoption. Our past studies and ongoing interactions indicate that medical experts can use AI systems with greater trust if there are ways to connect the model inferences about patients to explanations that are tied back to the context of use. Specifically, risk prediction is a complex problem of diagnostic and interventional importance to clinicians wherein they consult different sources to make decisions. To enable the adoption of the ever improving AI risk prediction models in practice, we have begun to explore techniques to contextualize such models along three dimensions of interest: the patients' clinical state, AI predictions about their risk of complications, and algorithmic explanations supporting the predictions. We validate the importance of these dimensions by implementing a proof-of-concept (POC) in type-2 diabetes (T2DM) use case where we assess the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) - a common T2DM comorbidity. Within the POC, we include risk prediction models for CKD, post-hoc explainers of the predictions, and other natural-language modules which operationalize domain knowledge and CPGs to provide context. With primary care physicians (PCP) as our end-users, we present our initial results and clinician feedback in this paper. Our POC approach covers multiple knowledge sources and clinical scenarios, blends knowledge to explain data and predictions to PCPs, and received an enthusiastic response from our medical expert.\n",
      "Black-box machine learning learning methods are now routinely used in high-risk settings, like medical diagnostics, which demand uncertainty quantification to avoid consequential model failures. Distribution-free uncertainty quantification (distribution-free UQ) is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous confidence intervals/sets for such predictions. Critically, the intervals/sets are valid without distributional assumptions or model assumptions, with explicit guarantees with finitely many datapoints. Moreover, they adapt to the difficulty of the input; when the input example is difficult, the uncertainty intervals/sets are large, signaling that the model might be wrong. Without much work, one can use distribution-free methods on any underlying algorithm, such as a neural network, to produce confidence sets guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. Indeed, the methods are easy-to-understand and general, applying to many modern prediction problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed at a reader interested in the practical implementation of distribution-free UQ, including conformal prediction and related methods, who is not necessarily a statistician. We will include many explanatory illustrations, examples, and code samples in Python, with PyTorch syntax. The goal is to provide the reader a working understanding of distribution-free UQ, allowing them to put confidence intervals on their algorithms, with one self-contained document.\n",
      "The world of empirical machine learning (ML) strongly relies on benchmarks in order to determine the relative effectiveness of different algorithms and methods. This paper proposes the notion of \"a benchmark lottery\" that describes the overall fragility of the ML benchmarking process. The benchmark lottery postulates that many factors, other than fundamental algorithmic superiority, may lead to a method being perceived as superior. On multiple benchmark setups that are prevalent in the ML community, we show that the relative performance of algorithms may be altered significantly simply by choosing different benchmark tasks, highlighting the fragility of the current paradigms and potential fallacious interpretation derived from benchmarking ML methods. Given that every benchmark makes a statement about what it perceives to be important, we argue that this might lead to biased progress in the community. We discuss the implications of the observed phenomena and provide recommendations on mitigating them using multiple machine learning domains and communities as use cases, including natural language processing, computer vision, information retrieval, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.\n",
      "Humans and other intelligent animals evolved highly sophisticated perception systems that combine multiple sensory modalities. On the other hand, state-of-the-art artificial agents rely mostly on visual inputs or structured low-dimensional observations provided by instrumented environments. Learning to act based on combined visual and auditory inputs is still a new topic of research that has not been explored beyond simple scenarios. To facilitate progress in this area we introduce a new version of VizDoom simulator to create a highly efficient learning environment that provides raw audio observations. We study the performance of different model architectures in a series of tasks that require the agent to recognize sounds and execute instructions given in natural language. Finally, we train our agent to play the full game of Doom and find that it can consistently defeat a traditional vision-based adversary. We are currently in the process of merging the augmented simulator with the main ViZDoom code repository. Video demonstrations and experiment code can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/sound-rl.\n",
      "The last decade has seen a significant increase of interest in deep learning research, with many public successes that have demonstrated its potential. As such, these systems are now being incorporated into commercial products. With this comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that solve tasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple solutions have been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in particular: learning from human feedback. Rather than training AI systems using a predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with a predefined set of categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived from some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the understanding of the task changes, or as the capabilities of the AI system improve.   The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward research on this important class of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which we expect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions. These tasks are defined by a paragraph of natural language: for example, \"create a waterfall and take a scenic picture of it\", with additional clarifying details. Participants must train a separate agent for each task, using any method they want. Agents are then evaluated by humans who have read the task description. To help participants get started, we provide a dataset of human demonstrations on each of the four tasks, as well as an imitation learning baseline that leverages these demonstrations.   Our hope is that this competition will improve our ability to build AI systems that do what their designers intend them to do, even when the intent cannot be easily formalized. Besides allowing AI to solve more tasks, this can also enable more effective regulation of AI systems, as well as making progress on the value alignment problem.\n",
      "Deep learning provides a promising way to extract effective representations from raw data in an end-to-end fashion and has proven its effectiveness in various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, etc. However, in domains such as content/product recommendation and risk management, where sequence of event data is the most used raw data form and experts derived features are more commonly used, deep learning models struggle to dominate the game. In this paper, we propose a symbolic testing framework that helps to answer the question of what kinds of expert-derived features could be learned by a neural network. Inspired by this testing framework, we introduce an efficient architecture named SHORING, which contains two components: \\textit{event network} and \\textit{sequence network}. The \\textit{event} network learns arbitrarily yet efficiently high-order \\textit{event-level} embeddings via a provable reparameterization trick, the \\textit{sequence} network aggregates from sequence of \\textit{event-level} embeddings. We argue that SHORING is capable of learning certain standard symbolic expressions which the standard multi-head self-attention network fails to learn, and conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on four synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets. The results show that SHORING empirically outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "This paper addresses the problem of media retrieval using a multimodal query (a query which combines visual input with additional semantic information in natural language feedback). We propose a SynthTriplet GAN framework which resolves this task by expanding the multimodal query with a synthetically generated image that captures semantic information from both image and text input. We introduce a novel triplet mining method that uses a synthetic image as an anchor to directly optimize for embedding distances of generated and target images. We demonstrate that apart from the added value of retrieval illustration with synthetic image with the focus on customization and user feedback, the proposed method greatly surpasses other multimodal generation methods and achieves state of the art results in the multimodal retrieval task. We also show that in contrast to other retrieval methods, our method provides explainable embeddings.\n",
      "Deep Learning (DL) is considered the state-of-the-art in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. Until recently, it was also widely accepted that DL is irrelevant for learning tasks on tabular data, especially in the small sample regime where ensemble methods are acknowledged as the gold standard. We present a new end-to-end differentiable method to train a standard FFNN. Our method, \\textbf{Muddling labels for Regularization} (\\texttt{MLR}), penalizes memorization through the generation of uninformative labels and the application of a differentiable close-form regularization scheme on the last hidden layer during training. \\texttt{MLR} outperforms classical NN and the gold standard (GBDT, RF) for regression and classification tasks on several datasets from the UCI database and Kaggle covering a large range of sample sizes and feature to sample ratios. Researchers and practitioners can use \\texttt{MLR} on its own as an off-the-shelf \\DL{} solution or integrate it into the most advanced ML pipelines.\n",
      "Breakthroughs in machine learning in the last decade have led to `digital intelligence', i.e. machine learning models capable of learning from vast amounts of labeled data to perform several digital tasks such as speech recognition, face recognition, machine translation and so on. The goal of this thesis is to make progress towards designing algorithms capable of `physical intelligence', i.e. building intelligent autonomous navigation agents capable of learning to perform complex navigation tasks in the physical world involving visual perception, natural language understanding, reasoning, planning, and sequential decision making. Despite several advances in classical navigation methods in the last few decades, current navigation agents struggle at long-term semantic navigation tasks. In the first part of the thesis, we discuss our work on short-term navigation using end-to-end reinforcement learning to tackle challenges such as obstacle avoidance, semantic perception, language grounding, and reasoning. In the second part, we present a new class of navigation methods based on modular learning and structured explicit map representations, which leverage the strengths of both classical and end-to-end learning methods, to tackle long-term navigation tasks. We show that these methods are able to effectively tackle challenges such as localization, mapping, long-term planning, exploration and learning semantic priors. These modular learning methods are capable of long-term spatial and semantic understanding and achieve state-of-the-art results on various navigation tasks.\n",
      "Unsupervised domain adaptation is used in many machine learning applications where, during training, a model has access to unlabeled data in the target domain, and a related labeled dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel and general domain-adversarial framework. Specifically, we derive a novel generalization bound for domain adaptation that exploits a new measure of discrepancy between distributions based on a variational characterization of f-divergences. It recovers the theoretical results from Ben-David et al. (2010a) as a special case and supports divergences used in practice. Based on this bound, we derive a new algorithmic framework that introduces a key correction in the original adversarial training method of Ganin et al. (2016). We show that many regularizers and ad-hoc objectives introduced over the last years in this framework are then not required to achieve performance comparable to (if not better than) state-of-the-art domain-adversarial methods. Experimental analysis conducted on real-world natural language and computer vision datasets show that our framework outperforms existing baselines, and obtains the best results for f-divergences that were not considered previously in domain-adversarial learning.\n",
      "Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of important innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going efforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces layoutparser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applications. The core layoutparser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout detection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, layoutparser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digitization pipelines. We demonstrate that layoutparser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io/.\n",
      "Deep learning on graphs has recently achieved remarkable success on a variety of tasks while such success relies heavily on the massive and carefully labeled data. However, precise annotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this problem, self-supervised learning (SSL) is emerging as a new paradigm for extracting informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels. In this survey, we extend the concept of SSL, which first emerged in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, to present a timely and comprehensive review of the existing SSL techniques for graph data. Specifically, we divide existing graph SSL methods into three categories: contrastive, generative, and predictive. More importantly, unlike many other surveys that only provide a high-level description of published research, we present an additional mathematical summary of the existing works in a unified framework. Furthermore, to facilitate methodological development and empirical comparisons, we also summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, downstream tasks, and open-source implementations of various algorithms. Finally, we discuss the technical challenges and potential future directions for improving graph self-supervised learning.\n",
      "Inductive program synthesis, or inferring programs from examples of desired behavior, offers a general paradigm for building interpretable, robust, and generalizable machine learning systems. Effective program synthesis depends on two key ingredients: a strong library of functions from which to build programs, and an efficient search strategy for finding programs that solve a given task. We introduce LAPS (Language for Abstraction and Program Search), a technique for using natural language annotations to guide joint learning of libraries and neurally-guided search models for synthesis. When integrated into a state-of-the-art library learning system (DreamCoder), LAPS produces higher-quality libraries and improves search efficiency and generalization on three domains -- string editing, image composition, and abstract reasoning about scenes -- even when no natural language hints are available at test time.\n",
      "Predicting gender by the name is not a simple task. In many applications, especially in the natural language processing (NLP) field, this task may be necessary, mainly when considering foreign names. Some machine learning algorithms can satisfactorily perform the prediction. In this paper, we examined and implemented feedforward and recurrent deep neural network models, such as MLP, RNN, GRU, CNN, and BiLSTM, to classify gender through the first name. A dataset of Brazilian names is used to train and evaluate the models. We analyzed the accuracy, recall, precision, and confusion matrix to measure the models' performances. The results indicate that the gender prediction can be performed from the feature extraction strategy looking at the names as a set of strings. Some models accurately predict the gender in more than 90% of the cases. The recurrent models overcome the feedforward models in this binary classification problem.\n",
      "Purpose: Image classification is perhaps the most fundamental task in imaging AI. However, labeling images is time-consuming and tedious. We have recently demonstrated that reinforcement learning (RL) can classify 2D slices of MRI brain images with high accuracy. Here we make two important steps toward speeding image classification: Firstly, we automatically extract class labels from the clinical reports. Secondly, we extend our prior 2D classification work to fully 3D image volumes from our institution. Hence, we proceed as follows: in Part 1, we extract labels from reports automatically using the SBERT natural language processing approach. Then, in Part 2, we use these labels with RL to train a classification Deep-Q Network (DQN) for 3D image volumes.   Methods: For Part 1, we trained SBERT with 90 radiology report impressions. We then used the trained SBERT to predict class labels for use in Part 2. In Part 2, we applied multi-step image classification to allow for combined Deep-Q learning using 3D convolutions and TD(0) Q learning. We trained on a set of 90 images. We tested on a separate set of 61 images, again using the classes predicted from patient reports by the trained SBERT in Part 1. For comparison, we also trained and tested a supervised deep learning classification network on the same set of training and testing images using the same labels.   Results: Part 1: Upon training with the corpus of radiology reports, the SBERT model had 100% accuracy for both normal and metastasis-containing scans. Part 2: Then, using these labels, whereas the supervised approach quickly overfit the training data and as expected performed poorly on the testing set (66% accuracy, just over random guessing), the reinforcement learning approach achieved an accuracy of 92%. The results were found to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 3.1 x 10^-5.\n",
      "Machine learning is vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks. It is now well understood that by changing the underlying data distribution, an adversary can poison the model trained with it or introduce backdoors. In this paper we present a novel class of training-time attacks that require no changes to the underlying dataset or model architecture, but instead only change the order in which data are supplied to the model. In particular, we find that the attacker can either prevent the model from learning, or poison it to learn behaviours specified by the attacker. Furthermore, we find that even a single adversarially-ordered epoch can be enough to slow down model learning, or even to reset all of the learning progress. Indeed, the attacks presented here are not specific to the model or dataset, but rather target the stochastic nature of modern learning procedures. We extensively evaluate our attacks on computer vision and natural language benchmarks to find that the adversary can disrupt model training and even introduce backdoors.\n",
      "Questions of fairness, robustness, and transparency are paramount to address before deploying NLP systems. Central to these concerns is the question of reliability: Can NLP systems reliably treat different demographics fairly and function correctly in diverse and noisy environments? To address this, we argue for the need for reliability testing and contextualize it among existing work on improving accountability. We show how adversarial attacks can be reframed for this goal, via a framework for developing reliability tests. We argue that reliability testing -- with an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration -- will enable rigorous and targeted testing, and aid in the enactment and enforcement of industry standards.\n",
      "In this article, we introduce a novel variant of the Tsetlin machine (TM) that randomly drops clauses, the key learning elements of a TM. In effect, TM with drop clause ignores a random selection of the clauses in each epoch, selected according to a predefined probability. In this way, additional stochasticity is introduced in the learning phase of TM. Along with producing more distinct and well-structured patterns that improve the performance, we also show that dropping clauses increases learning robustness. To explore the effects clause dropping has on accuracy, training time, and interpretability, we conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets in natural language processing (NLP) (IMDb and SST2) as well as computer vision (MNIST and CIFAR10). In brief, we observe from +2% to +4% increase in accuracy and 2x to 4x faster learning. We further employ the Convolutional TM to document interpretable results on the CIFAR10 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an interpretable machine learning algorithm has been used to produce pixel-level human-interpretable results on CIFAR10. Also, unlike previous interpretable methods that focus on attention visualisation or gradient interpretability, we show that the TM is a more general interpretable method. That is, by producing rule-based propositional logic expressions that are \\emph{human}-interpretable, the TM can explain how it classifies a particular instance at the pixel level for computer vision and at the word level for NLP.\n",
      "Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets contain annotation artefacts resulting in spurious correlations between the natural language utterances and their respective entailment classes. These artefacts are exploited by neural networks even when only considering the hypothesis and ignoring the premise, leading to unwanted biases. Belinkov et al. (2019b) proposed tackling this problem via adversarial training, but this can lead to learned sentence representations that still suffer from the same biases. We show that the bias can be reduced in the sentence representations by using an ensemble of adversaries, encouraging the model to jointly decrease the accuracy of these different adversaries while fitting the data. This approach produces more robust NLI models, outperforming previous de-biasing efforts when generalised to 12 other datasets (Belinkov et al., 2019a; Mahabadi et al., 2020). In addition, we find that the optimal number of adversarial classifiers depends on the dimensionality of the sentence representations, with larger sentence representations being more difficult to de-bias while benefiting from using a greater number of adversaries.\n",
      "Interactive robots navigating photo-realistic environments face challenges underlying vision-and-language navigation (VLN), but in addition, they need to be trained to handle the dynamic nature of dialogue. However, research in Cooperative Vision-and-Dialog Navigation (CVDN), where a navigator interacts with a guide in natural language in order to reach a goal, treats the dialogue history as a VLN-style static instruction. In this paper, we present VISITRON, a navigator better suited to the interactive regime inherent to CVDN by being trained to: i) identify and associate object-level concepts and semantics between the environment and dialogue history, ii) identify when to interact vs. navigate via imitation learning of a binary classification head. We perform extensive ablations with VISITRON to gain empirical insights and improve performance on CVDN. VISITRON is competitive with models on the static CVDN leaderboard. We also propose a generalized interactive regime to fine-tune and evaluate VISITRON and future such models with pre-trained guides for adaptability.\n",
      "The AI City Challenge was created with two goals in mind: (1) pushing the boundaries of research and development in intelligent video analysis for smarter cities use cases, and (2) assessing tasks where the level of performance is enough to cause real-world adoption. Transportation is a segment ripe for such adoption. The fifth AI City Challenge attracted 305 participating teams across 38 countries, who leveraged city-scale real traffic data and high-quality synthetic data to compete in five challenge tracks. Track 1 addressed video-based automatic vehicle counting, where the evaluation being conducted on both algorithmic effectiveness and computational efficiency. Track 2 addressed city-scale vehicle re-identification with augmented synthetic data to substantially increase the training set for the task. Track 3 addressed city-scale multi-target multi-camera vehicle tracking. Track 4 addressed traffic anomaly detection. Track 5 was a new track addressing vehicle retrieval using natural language descriptions. The evaluation system shows a general leader board of all submitted results, and a public leader board of results limited to the contest participation rules, where teams are not allowed to use external data in their work. The public leader board shows results more close to real-world situations where annotated data is limited. Results show the promise of AI in Smarter Transportation. State-of-the-art performance for some tasks shows that these technologies are ready for adoption in real-world systems.\n",
      "Searching for objects in indoor organized environments such as homes or offices is part of our everyday activities. When looking for a target object, we jointly reason about the rooms and containers the object is likely to be in; the same type of container will have a different probability of having the target depending on the room it is in. We also combine geometric and semantic information to infer what container is best to search, or what other objects are best to move, if the target object is hidden from view. We propose to use a 3D scene graph representation to capture the hierarchical, semantic, and geometric aspects of this problem. To exploit this representation in a search process, we introduce Hierarchical Mechanical Search (HMS), a method that guides an agent's actions towards finding a target object specified with a natural language description. HMS is based on a novel neural network architecture that uses neural message passing of vectors with visual, geometric, and linguistic information to allow HMS to reason across layers of the graph while combining semantic and geometric cues. HMS is evaluated on a novel dataset of 500 3D scene graphs with dense placements of semantically related objects in storage locations, and is shown to be significantly better than several baselines at finding objects and close to the oracle policy in terms of the median number of actions required. Additional qualitative results can be found at https://ai.stanford.edu/mech-search/hms.\n",
      "Performance of recommender systems (RS) relies heavily on the amount of training data available. This poses a chicken-and-egg problem for early-stage products, whose amount of data, in turn, relies on the performance of their RS. On the other hand, zero-shot learning promises some degree of generalization from an old dataset to an entirely new dataset. In this paper, we explore the possibility of zero-shot learning in RS. We develop an algorithm, dubbed ZEro-Shot Recommenders (ZESRec), that is trained on an old dataset and generalize to a new one where there are neither overlapping users nor overlapping items, a setting that contrasts typical cross-domain RS that has either overlapping users or items. Different from categorical item indices, i.e., item ID, in previous methods, ZESRec uses items' natural-language descriptions (or description embeddings) as their continuous indices, and therefore naturally generalize to any unseen items. In terms of users, ZESRec builds upon recent advances on sequential RS to represent users using their interactions with items, thereby generalizing to unseen users as well. We study two pairs of real-world RS datasets and demonstrate that ZESRec can successfully enable recommendations in such a zero-shot setting, opening up new opportunities for resolving the chicken-and-egg problem for data-scarce startups or early-stage products.\n",
      "This paper is based on a machine learning project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, fall 2020. The project was initiated with a literature review on the latest developments within time-series forecasting methods in the scientific community over the past five years. The paper summarizes the essential aspects of this research. Furthermore, in this paper, we introduce an LSTM cell's architecture, and explain how different components go together to alter the cell's memory and predict the output. Also, the paper provides the necessary formulas and foundations to calculate a forward iteration through an LSTM. Then, the paper refers to some practical applications and research that emphasize the strength and weaknesses of LSTMs, shown within the time-series domain and the natural language processing (NLP) domain. Finally, alternative statistical methods for time series predictions are highlighted, where the paper outline ARIMA and exponential smoothing. Nevertheless, as LSTMs can be viewed as a complex architecture, the paper assumes that the reader has some knowledge of essential machine learning aspects, such as the multi-layer perceptron, activation functions, overfitting, backpropagation, bias, over- and underfitting, and more.\n",
      "Real-world data often exhibit imbalanced distributions, where certain target values have significantly fewer observations. Existing techniques for dealing with imbalanced data focus on targets with categorical indices, i.e., different classes. However, many tasks involve continuous targets, where hard boundaries between classes do not exist. We define Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR) as learning from such imbalanced data with continuous targets, dealing with potential missing data for certain target values, and generalizing to the entire target range. Motivated by the intrinsic difference between categorical and continuous label space, we propose distribution smoothing for both labels and features, which explicitly acknowledges the effects of nearby targets, and calibrates both label and learned feature distributions.

      "Source code summarization aims to generate natural language summaries from structured code snippets for better understanding code functionalities. However, automatic code summarization is challenging due to the complexity of the source code and the language gap between the source code and natural language summaries. Most previous approaches either rely on retrieval-based (which can take advantage of similar examples seen from the retrieval database, but have low generalization performance) or generation-based methods (which have better generalization performance, but cannot take advantage of similar examples). This paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented mechanism to combine the benefits of both worlds. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on capturing global graph structure information of source code, we propose a novel attention-based dynamic graph to complement the static graph representation of the source code, and design a hybrid message passing GNN for capturing both the local and global structural information. To evaluate the proposed approach, we release a new challenging benchmark, crawled from diversified large-scale open-source C projects (total 95k+ unique functions in the dataset). Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance, improving existing methods by 1.42, 2.44 and 1.29 in terms of BLEU-4, ROUGE-L and METEOR.\n",
      "Customers of machine learning systems demand accountability from the companies employing these algorithms for various prediction tasks. Accountability requires understanding of system limit and condition of erroneous predictions, as customers are often interested in understanding the incorrect predictions, and model developers are absorbed in finding methods that can be used to get incremental improvements to an existing system. Therefore, we propose an accountable error characterization method, AEC, to understand when and where errors occur within the existing black-box models. AEC, as constructed with human-understandable linguistic features, allows the model developers to automatically identify the main sources of errors for a given classification system. It can also be used to sample for the set of most informative input points for a next round of training. We perform error detection for a sentiment analysis task using AEC as a case study. Our results on the sample sentiment task show that AEC is able to characterize erroneous predictions into human understandable categories and also achieves promising results on selecting erroneous samples when compared with the uncertainty-based sampling.\n",
      "Visual question answering (VQA) is a task that combines both the techniques of computer vision and natural language processing. It requires models to answer a text-based question according to the information contained in a visual. In recent years, the research field of VQA has been expanded. Research that focuses on the VQA, examining the reasoning ability and VQA on scientific diagrams, has also been explored more. Meanwhile, more multimodal feature fusion mechanisms have been proposed. This paper will review and analyze existing datasets, metrics, and models proposed for the VQA task.\n",
      "There has been recently a growing interest in studying adversarial examples on natural language models in the black-box setting. These methods attack natural language classifiers by perturbing certain important words until the classifier label is changed. In order to find these important words, these methods rank all words by importance by querying the target model word by word for each input sentence, resulting in high query inefficiency. A new interesting approach was introduced that addresses this problem through interpretable learning to learn the word ranking instead of previous expensive search. The main advantage of using this approach is that it achieves comparable attack rates to the state-of-the-art methods, yet faster and with fewer queries, where fewer queries are desirable to avoid suspicion towards the attacking agent. Nonetheless, this approach sacrificed the useful information that could be leveraged from the target classifier for that sake of query efficiency. In this paper we study the effect of leveraging the target model outputs and data on both attack rates and average number of queries, and we show that both can be improved, with a limited overhead of additional queries.\n",
      "Deep learning has yielded extraordinary results in vision and natural language processing, but this achievement comes at a cost. Most deep learning models require enormous resources during training, both in terms of computation and in human labeling effort. In this paper, we show that one can achieve similar accuracy to traditional deep-learning models, while using less training data. Much of the previous work in this area relies on using uncertainty or some form of diversity to select subsets of a larger training set. Submodularity, a discrete analogue of convexity, has been exploited to model diversity in various settings including data subset selection. In contrast to prior methods, we propose a novel diversity driven objective function, and balancing constraints on class labels and decision boundaries using matroids. This allows us to use efficient greedy algorithms with approximation guarantees for subset selection. We outperform baselines on standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In addition, we also show that the proposed balancing constraints can play a key role in boosting the performance in long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR-100-LT.\n",
      "In many real-world scenarios where extrinsic rewards to the agent are extremely sparse, curiosity has emerged as a useful concept providing intrinsic rewards that enable the agent to explore its environment and acquire information to achieve its goals. Despite their strong performance on many sparse-reward tasks, existing curiosity approaches rely on an overly holistic view of state transitions, and do not allow for a structured understanding of specific aspects of the environment. In this paper, we formulate curiosity based on grounded question answering by encouraging the agent to ask questions about the environment and be curious when the answers to these questions change. We show that natural language questions encourage the agent to uncover specific knowledge about their environment such as the physical properties of objects as well as their spatial relationships with other objects, which serve as valuable curiosity rewards to solve sparse-reward tasks more efficiently.\n",
      "Natural language-based vehicle retrieval is a task to find a target vehicle within a given image based on a natural language description as a query. This technology can be applied to various areas including police searching for a suspect vehicle. However, it is challenging due to the ambiguity of language descriptions and the difficulty of processing multi-modal data. To tackle this problem, we propose a deep neural network called SBNet that performs natural language-based segmentation for vehicle retrieval. We also propose two task-specific modules to improve performance: a substitution module that helps features from different domains to be embedded in the same space and a future prediction module that learns temporal information. SBnet has been trained using the CityFlow-NL dataset that contains 2,498 tracks of vehicles with three unique natural language descriptions each and tested 530 unique vehicle tracks and their corresponding query sets. SBNet achieved a significant improvement over the baseline in the natural language-based vehicle tracking track in the AI City Challenge 2021.\n",
      "Chest radiography is the most common radiographic examination performed in daily clinical practice for the detection of various heart and lung abnormalities. The large amount of data to be read and reported, with more than 100 studies per day for a single radiologist, poses a challenge in consistently maintaining high interpretation accuracy. The introduction of large-scale public datasets has led to a series of novel systems for automated abnormality classification. However, the labels of these datasets were obtained using natural language processed medical reports, yielding a large degree of label noise that can impact the performance. In this study, we propose novel training strategies that handle label noise from such suboptimal data. Prior label probabilities were measured on a subset of training data re-read by 4 board-certified radiologists and were used during training to increase the robustness of the training model to the label noise. Furthermore, we exploit the high comorbidity of abnormalities observed in chest radiography and incorporate this information to further reduce the impact of label noise. Additionally, anatomical knowledge is incorporated by training the system to predict lung and heart segmentation, as well as spatial knowledge labels. To deal with multiple datasets and images derived from various scanners that apply different post-processing techniques, we introduce a novel image normalization strategy. Experiments were performed on an extensive collection of 297,541 chest radiographs from 86,876 patients, leading to a state-of-the-art performance level for 17 abnormalities from 2 datasets. With an average AUC score of 0.880 across all abnormalities, our proposed training strategies can be used to significantly improve performance scores.\n",
      "Machine learning applications to symbolic mathematics are becoming increasingly popular, yet there lacks a centralized source of real-world symbolic expressions to be used as training data. In contrast, the field of natural language processing leverages resources like Wikipedia that provide enormous amounts of real-world textual data. Adopting the philosophy of \"mathematics as language,\" we bridge this gap by introducing a pipeline for distilling mathematical expressions embedded in Wikipedia into symbolic encodings to be used in downstream machine learning tasks. We demonstrate that a $\\textit{mathematical}$ $\\textit{language}$ $\\textit{model}$ trained on this \"corpus\" of expressions can be used as a prior to improve the performance of neural-guided search for the task of symbolic regression.\n",
      "A full-fledged data exploration system must combine different access modalities with a powerful concept of guiding the user in the exploration process, by being reactive and anticipative both for data discovery and for data linking. Such systems are a real opportunity for our community to cater to users with different domain and data science expertise. We introduce INODE -- an end-to-end data exploration system -- that leverages, on the one hand, Machine Learning and, on the other hand, semantics for the purpose of Data Management (DM). Our vision is to develop a classic unified, comprehensive platform that provides extensive access to open datasets, and we demonstrate it in three significant use cases in the fields of Cancer Biomarker Reearch, Research and Innovation Policy Making, and Astrophysics. INODE offers sustainable services in (a) data modeling and linking, (b) integrated query processing using natural language, (c) guidance, and (d) data exploration through visualization, thus facilitating the user in discovering new insights. We demonstrate that our system is uniquely accessible to a wide range of users from larger scientific communities to the public. Finally, we briefly illustrate how this work paves the way for new research opportunities in DM.\n",
      "We algorithmically identify label errors in the test sets of 10 of the most commonly-used computer vision, natural language, and audio datasets, and subsequently study the potential for these label errors to affect benchmark results. Errors in test sets are numerous and widespread: we estimate an average of 3.4% errors across the 10 datasets, where for example 2916 label errors comprise 6% of the ImageNet validation set. Putative label errors are found using confident learning and then human-validated via crowdsourcing (54% of the algorithmically-flagged candidates are indeed erroneously labeled). Surprisingly, we find that lower capacity models may be practically more useful than higher capacity models in real-world datasets with high proportions of erroneously labeled data. For example, on ImageNet with corrected labels: ResNet-18 outperforms ResNet-50 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 6%. On CIFAR-10 with corrected labels: VGG-11 outperforms VGG-19 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by 5%. Traditionally, ML practitioners choose which model to deploy based on test accuracy -- our findings advise caution here, proposing that judging models over correctly labeled test sets may be more useful, especially for noisy real-world datasets.\n",
      "Over the last decade, the use of Deep Learning in many applications produced results that are comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. The application domains include diagnosing diseases, finance, agriculture, search engines, robot vision, and many others. In this paper, we are proposing an architecture that utilizes image/video captioning methods and Natural Language Processing systems to generate a title and a concise abstract for a video. Such a system can potentially be utilized in many application domains, including, the cinema industry, video search engines, security surveillance, video databases/warehouses, data centers, and others. The proposed system functions and operates as followed: it reads a video; representative image frames are identified and selected; the image frames are captioned; NLP is applied to all generated captions together with text summarization; and finally, a title and an abstract are generated for the video. All functions are performed automatically. Preliminary results are provided in this paper using publicly available datasets. This paper is not concerned about the efficiency of the system at the execution time. We hope to be able to address execution efficiency issues in our subsequent publications.\n",
      "Most of state of the art methods applied on time series consist of deep learning methods that are too complex to be interpreted. This lack of interpretability is a major drawback, as several applications in the real world are critical tasks, such as the medical field or the autonomous driving field. The explainability of models applied on time series has not gather much attention compared to the computer vision or the natural language processing fields. In this paper, we present an overview of existing explainable AI (XAI) methods applied on time series and illustrate the type of explanations they produce. We also provide a reflection on the impact of these explanation methods to provide confidence and trust in the AI systems.\n",
      "A special purpose learning system assumes knowledge of admissible tasks at design time. Adapting such a system to unforeseen tasks requires architecture manipulation such as adding an output head for each new task or dataset. In this work, we propose a task-agnostic vision-language system that accepts an image and a natural language task description and outputs bounding boxes, confidences, and text. The system supports a wide range of vision tasks such as classification, localization, question answering, captioning, and more. We evaluate the system's ability to learn multiple skills simultaneously, to perform tasks with novel skill-concept combinations, and to learn new skills efficiently and without forgetting.\n",
      "Natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is one of the key components for service robots to be able to work in human-centric environments. In such dynamic environments, the robot needs to understand the intention of the user to accomplish a task successfully. Towards addressing this point, we propose a software architecture that segments a target object from a crowded scene, indicated verbally by a human user. At the core of our system, we employ a multi-modal deep neural network for visual grounding. Unlike most grounding methods that tackle the challenge using pre-trained object detectors via a two-stepped process, we develop a single stage zero-shot model that is able to provide predictions in unseen data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on real RGB-D data collected from public scene datasets. Experimental results showed that the proposed model performs well in terms of accuracy and speed, while showcasing robustness to variation in the natural language input.\n",
      "Tracking by natural language specification is a new rising research topic that aims at locating the target object in the video sequence based on its language description. Compared with traditional bounding box (BBox) based tracking, this setting guides object tracking with high-level semantic information, addresses the ambiguity of BBox, and links local and global search organically together. Those benefits may bring more flexible, robust and accurate tracking performance in practical scenarios. However, existing natural language initialized trackers are developed and compared on benchmark datasets proposed for tracking-by-BBox, which can't reflect the true power of tracking-by-language. In this work, we propose a new benchmark specifically dedicated to the tracking-by-language, including a large scale dataset, strong and diverse baseline methods. Specifically, we collect 2k video sequences (contains a total of 1,244,340 frames, 663 words) and split 1300/700 for the train/testing respectively. We densely annotate one sentence in English and corresponding bounding boxes of the target object for each video. We also introduce two new challenges into TNL2K for the object tracking task, i.e., adversarial samples and modality switch. A strong baseline method based on an adaptive local-global-search scheme is proposed for future works to compare. We believe this benchmark will greatly boost related researches on natural language guided tracking.\n",
      "Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a multimodal task where an agent follows natural language instructions and navigates in visual environments. Multiple setups have been proposed, and researchers apply new model architectures or training techniques to boost navigation performance. However, recent studies witness a slow-down in the performance improvements in both indoor and outdoor VLN tasks, and the agents' inner mechanisms for making navigation decisions remain unclear. To the best of our knowledge, the way the agents perceive the multimodal input is under-studied and clearly needs investigations. In this work, we conduct a series of diagnostic experiments to unveil agents' focus during navigation. Results show that indoor navigation agents refer to both object tokens and direction tokens in the instruction when making decisions. In contrast, outdoor navigation agents heavily rely on direction tokens and have a poor understanding of the object tokens. Furthermore, instead of merely staring at surrounding objects, indoor navigation agents can set their sights on objects further from the current viewpoint. When it comes to vision-and-language alignments, many models claim that they are able to align object tokens with certain visual targets, but we cast doubt on the reliability of such alignments.\n",
      "The advent of larger machine learning (ML) models have improved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various modeling tasks, ranging from computer vision to natural language. As ML models continue increasing in size, so does their respective energy consumption and computational requirements. However, the methods for tracking, reporting, and comparing energy consumption remain limited. We presentEnergyVis, an interactive energy consumption tracker for ML models. Consisting of multiple coordinated views, EnergyVis enables researchers to interactively track, visualize and compare model energy consumption across key energy consumption and carbon footprint metrics (kWh and CO2), helping users explore alternative deployment locations and hardware that may reduce carbon footprints. EnergyVis aims to raise awareness concerning computational sustainability by interactively highlighting excessive energy usage during model training; and by providing alternative training options to reduce energy usage.\n",
      "Cognitive grammar suggests that the acquisition of language grammar is grounded within visual structures. While grammar is an essential representation of natural language, it also exists ubiquitously in vision to represent the hierarchical part-whole structure. In this work, we study grounded grammar induction of vision and language in a joint learning framework. Specifically, we present VLGrammar, a method that uses compound probabilistic context-free grammars (compound PCFGs) to induce the language grammar and the image grammar simultaneously. We propose a novel contrastive learning framework to guide the joint learning of both modules. To provide a benchmark for the grounded grammar induction task, we collect a large-scale dataset, \\textsc{PartIt}, which contains human-written sentences that describe part-level semantics for 3D objects. Experiments on the \\textsc{PartIt} dataset show that VLGrammar outperforms all baselines in image grammar induction and language grammar induction. The learned VLGrammar naturally benefits related downstream tasks. Specifically, it improves the image unsupervised clustering accuracy by 30\\%, and performs well in image retrieval and text retrieval. Notably, the induced grammar shows superior generalizability by easily generalizing to unseen categories.\n",
      "Veracity is an essential key in research and development of innovative products. Live Emotion analysis and verification nullify deceit made to complainers on live chat, corroborate messages of both ends in messaging apps and promote an honest conversation between users. The main concept behind this emotion artificial intelligent verifier is to license or decline message accountability by comparing variegated emotions of chat app users recognized through facial expressions and text prediction. In this paper, a proposed emotion intelligent live detector acts as an honest arbiter who distributes facial emotions into labels namely, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, and Hate. Further, it separately predicts a label of messages through text classification. Finally, it compares both labels and declares the message as a fraud or a bonafide. For emotion detection, we deployed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a miniXception model and for text prediction, we selected Support Vector Machine (SVM) natural language processing probability classifier due to receiving the best accuracy on training dataset after applying Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Logistic regression.\n",
      "Graph neural networks are emerging as continuation of deep learning success w.r.t. graph data. Tens of different graph neural network variants have been proposed, most following a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the node features are updated via aggregating features of its neighboring nodes from layer to layer. Though related research surges, the power of GNNs are still not on-par-with their counterpart CNNs in computer vision and RNNs in natural language processing. We rethink this problem from the perspective of information propagation, and propose to enhance information propagation among GNN layers by combining heterogeneous aggregations. We argue that as richer information are propagated from shallow to deep layers, the discriminative capability of features formulated by GNN can benefit from it. As our first attempt in this direction, a new generic GNN layer formulation and upon this a new GNN variant referred as HAG-Net is proposed. We empirically validate the effectiveness of HAG-Net on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and elaborate all the design options and criterions along with.\n",
      "We describe a procedure for explaining neurons in deep representations by identifying compositional logical concepts that closely approximate neuron behavior. Compared to prior work that uses atomic labels as explanations, analyzing neurons compositionally allows us to more precisely and expressively characterize their behavior. We use this procedure to answer several questions on interpretability in models for vision and natural language processing. First, we examine the kinds of abstractions learned by neurons. In image classification, we find that many neurons learn highly abstract but semantically coherent visual concepts, while other polysemantic neurons detect multiple unrelated features; in natural language inference (NLI), neurons learn shallow lexical heuristics from dataset biases. Second, we see whether compositional explanations give us insight into model performance: vision neurons that detect human-interpretable concepts are positively correlated with task performance, while NLI neurons that fire for shallow heuristics are negatively correlated with task performance. Finally, we show how compositional explanations provide an accessible way for end users to produce simple \"copy-paste\" adversarial examples that change model behavior in predictable ways.\n",
      "Existing deep learning models applied to reaction prediction in organic chemistry can reach high levels of accuracy (> 90% for Natural Language Processing-based ones). With no chemical knowledge embedded than the information learnt from reaction data, the quality of the data sets plays a crucial role in the performance of the prediction models. While human curation is prohibitively expensive, the need for unaided approaches to remove chemically incorrect entries from existing data sets is essential to improve artificial intelligence models' performance in synthetic chemistry tasks. Here we propose a machine learning-based, unassisted approach to remove chemically wrong entries from chemical reaction collections. We applied this method to the collection of chemical reactions Pistachio and to an open data set, both extracted from USPTO (United States Patent Office) patents. Our results show an improved prediction quality for models trained on the cleaned and balanced data sets. For the retrosynthetic models, the round-trip accuracy metric grows by 13 percentage points and the value of the cumulative Jensen Shannon divergence decreases by 30% compared to its original record. The coverage remains high with 97%, and the value of the class-diversity is not affected by the cleaning. The proposed strategy is the first unassisted rule-free technique to address automatic noise reduction in chemical data sets.\n",
      "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learn representation from data with an impressive capability, and brought important breakthroughs for processing images, time-series, natural language, audio, video, and many others. In the remote sensing field, surveys and literature revisions specifically involving DNNs algorithms' applications have been conducted in an attempt to summarize the amount of information produced in its subfields. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) based applications have dominated aerial sensing research. However, a literature revision that combines both \"deep learning\" and \"UAV remote sensing\" thematics has not yet been conducted. The motivation for our work was to present a comprehensive review of the fundamentals of Deep Learning (DL) applied in UAV-based imagery. We focused mainly on describing classification and regression techniques used in recent applications with UAV-acquired data. For that, a total of 232 papers published in international scientific journal databases was examined. We gathered the published material and evaluated their characteristics regarding application, sensor, and technique used. We relate how DL presents promising results and has the potential for processing tasks associated with UAV-based image data. Lastly, we project future perspectives, commentating on prominent DL paths to be explored in the UAV remote sensing field. Our revision consists of a friendly-approach to introduce, commentate, and summarize the state-of-the-art in UAV-based image applications with DNNs algorithms in diverse subfields of remote sensing, grouping it in the environmental, urban, and agricultural contexts.\n",
      "Cycle-consistent training is widely used for jointly learning a forward and inverse mapping between two domains of interest without the cumbersome requirement of collecting matched pairs within each domain. In this regard, the implicit assumption is that there exists (at least approximately) a ground-truth bijection such that a given input from either domain can be accurately reconstructed from successive application of the respective mappings. But in many applications no such bijection can be expected to exist and large reconstruction errors can compromise the success of cycle-consistent training. As one important instance of this limitation, we consider practically-relevant situations where there exists a many-to-one or surjective mapping between domains. To address this regime, we develop a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) approach that can be viewed as converting surjective mappings to implicit bijections whereby reconstruction errors in both directions can be minimized, and as a natural byproduct, realistic output diversity can be obtained in the one-to-many direction. As theoretical motivation, we analyze a simplified scenario whereby minima of the proposed CVAE-based energy function align with the recovery of ground-truth surjective mappings. On the empirical side, we consider a synthetic image dataset with known ground-truth, as well as a real-world application involving natural language generation from knowledge graphs and vice versa, a prototypical surjective case. For the latter, our CVAE pipeline can capture such many-to-one mappings during cycle training while promoting textural diversity for graph-to-text tasks.

      "A common vision from science fiction is that robots will one day inhabit our physical spaces, sense the world as we do, assist our physical labours, and communicate with us through natural language. Here we study how to design artificial agents that can interact naturally with humans using the simplification of a virtual environment. This setting nevertheless integrates a number of the central challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) research: complex visual perception and goal-directed physical control, grounded language comprehension and production, and multi-agent social interaction. To build agents that can robustly interact with humans, we would ideally train them while they interact with humans. However, this is presently impractical. Therefore, we approximate the role of the human with another learned agent, and use ideas from inverse reinforcement learning to reduce the disparities between human-human and agent-agent interactive behaviour. Rigorously evaluating our agents poses a great challenge, so we develop a variety of behavioural tests, including evaluation by humans who watch videos of agents or interact directly with them. These evaluations convincingly demonstrate that interactive training and auxiliary losses improve agent behaviour beyond what is achieved by supervised learning of actions alone. Further, we demonstrate that agent capabilities generalise beyond literal experiences in the dataset. Finally, we train evaluation models whose ratings of agents agree well with human judgement, thus permitting the evaluation of new agent models without additional effort. Taken together, our results in this virtual environment provide evidence that large-scale human behavioural imitation is a promising tool to create intelligent, interactive agents, and the challenge of reliably evaluating such agents is possible to surmount.\n",
      "Policy specification is a process by which a human can initialize a robot's behaviour and, in turn, warm-start policy optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL). While policy specification/design is inherently a collaborative process, modern methods based on Learning from Demonstration or Deep RL lack the model interpretability and accessibility to be classified as such. Current state-of-the-art methods for policy specification rely on black-box models, which are an insufficient means of collaboration for non-expert users: These models provide no means of inspecting policies learnt by the agent and are not focused on creating a usable modality for teaching robot behaviour. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning framework that enables humans to 1) specify, through natural language, interpretable policies in the form of easy-to-understand decision trees, 2) leverage these policies to warm-start reinforcement learning and 3) outperform baselines that lack our natural language initialization mechanism. We train our approach by collecting a first-of-its-kind corpus mapping free-form natural language policy descriptions to decision tree-based policies. We show that our novel framework translates natural language to decision trees with a 96% and 97% accuracy on a held-out corpus across two domains, respectively. Finally, we validate that policies initialized with natural language commands are able to significantly outperform relevant baselines (p < 0.001) that do not benefit from our natural language-based warm-start technique.\n",
      "The task of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) consists in answering natural language questions about a video and serves as a proxy to evaluate the performance of a model in scene sequence understanding. Most methods designed for VideoQA up-to-date are end-to-end deep learning architectures which struggle at complex temporal and causal reasoning and provide limited transparency in reasoning steps. We present the HySTER: a Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Event Reasoner to reason over physical events in videos. Our model leverages the strength of deep learning methods to extract information from video frames with the reasoning capabilities and explainability of symbolic artificial intelligence in an answer set programming framework. We define a method based on general temporal, causal and physics rules which can be transferred across tasks. We apply our model to the CLEVRER dataset and demonstrate state-of-the-art results in question answering accuracy. This work sets the foundations for the incorporation of inductive logic programming in the field of VideoQA.\n",
      "Image captioning is a challenging computer vision task, which aims to generate a natural language description of an image. Most recent researches follow the encoder-decoder framework which depends heavily on the previous generated words for the current prediction. Such methods can not effectively take advantage of the future predicted information to learn complete semantics. In this paper, we propose Context-Aware Auxiliary Guidance (CAAG) mechanism that can guide the captioning model to perceive global contexts. Upon the captioning model, CAAG performs semantic attention that selectively concentrates on useful information of the global predictions to reproduce the current generation. To validate the adaptability of the method, we apply CAAG to three popular captioners and our proposal achieves competitive performance on the challenging Microsoft COCO image captioning benchmark, e.g. 132.2 CIDEr-D score on Karpathy split and 130.7 CIDEr-D (c40) score on official online evaluation server.\n",

While different methods have been developed to represent the environment information and language actions, existing RL agents are not empowered with any reasoning capabilities to deal with textual games. In this work, we aim to conduct explicit reasoning with knowledge graphs for decision making, so that the actions of an agent are generated and supported by an interpretable inference procedure. We propose a stacked hierarchical attention mechanism to construct an explicit representation of the reasoning process by exploiting the structure of the knowledge graph. We extensively evaluate our method on a number of man-made benchmark games, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method performs better than existing text-based agents.\n",

In this survey, we cover and discuss the recent datasets released in the VQA domain dealing with various types of question-formats and robustness of the machine-learning models. Next, we discuss about new deep learning models that have shown promising results over the VQA datasets. At the end, we present and discuss some of the results computed by us over the vanilla VQA model, Stacked Attention Network and the VQA Challenge 2017 winner model. We also provide the detailed analysis along with the challenges and future research directions.\n",
      "Modern Neural Networks are eminent in achieving state of the art performance on tasks under Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and related verticals.

In order to achieve edge deployment, researchers have developed pruning and quantization algorithms to compress such networks without compromising their efficacy. Such compression algorithms are broadly experimented on standalone CNN and RNN architectures while in this work, we present an unconventional end to end compression pipeline of a CNN-LSTM based Image Captioning model. The model is trained using VGG16 or ResNet50 as an encoder and an LSTM decoder on the flickr8k dataset.

      "Humans generally use natural language to communicate task requirements to each other. Ideally, natural language should also be usable for communicating goals to autonomous machines (e.g., robots) to minimize friction in task specification. However, understanding and mapping natural language goals to sequences of states and actions is challenging. Specifically, existing work along these lines has encountered difficulty in generalizing learned policies to new natural language goals and environments. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a language-conditioned policy and reward function. To improve generalization of the learned policy and reward function, we use a variational goal generator to relabel trajectories and sample diverse goals during training. Our algorithm outperforms multiple baselines by a large margin on a vision-based natural language instruction following dataset (Room-2-Room), demonstrating a promising advance in enabling the use of natural language instructions in specifying agent goals.\n",
      "Most deep neural networks are considered to be black boxes, meaning their output is hard to interpret. In contrast, logical expressions are considered to be more comprehensible since they use symbols that are semantically close to natural language instead of distributed representations. However, for high-dimensional input data such as images, the individual symbols, i.e. pixels, are not easily interpretable. We introduce the concept of first-order convolutional rules, which are logical rules that can be extracted using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and whose complexity depends on the size of the convolutional filter and not on the dimensionality of the input. Our approach is based on rule extraction from binary neural networks with stochastic local search. We show how to extract rules that are not necessarily short, but characteristic of the input, and easy to visualize. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is able to model the functionality of the neural network while at the same time producing interpretable logical rules.\n",
      "Deep neural network models represent the state-of-the-art methodologies for natural language processing. Here we build on top of these methodologies to incorporate temporal information and model how to review data changes with time. Specifically, we use the dynamic representations of recurrent point process models, which encode the history of how business or service reviews are received in time, to generate instantaneous language models with improved prediction capabilities. Simultaneously, our methodologies enhance the predictive power of our point process models by incorporating summarized review content representations. We provide recurrent network and temporal convolution solutions for modeling the review content. We deploy our methodologies in the context of recommender systems, effectively characterizing the change in preference and taste of users as time evolves. Source code is available at [1].\n",
      "Visual captioning aims to generate textual descriptions given images or videos. Traditionally, image captioning models are trained on human annotated datasets such as Flickr30k and MS-COCO, which are limited in size and diversity. This limitation hinders the generalization capabilities of these models while also rendering them liable to making mistakes. Language models can, however, be trained on vast amounts of freely available unlabelled data and have recently emerged as successful language encoders and coherent text generators. Meanwhile, several unimodal and multimodal fusion techniques have been proven to work well for natural language generation and automatic speech recognition. Building on these recent developments, and with the aim of improving the quality of generated captions, the contribution of our work in this paper is two-fold: First, we propose a generic multimodal model fusion framework for caption generation as well as emendation where we utilize different fusion strategies to integrate a pretrained Auxiliary Language Model (AuxLM) within the traditional encoder-decoder visual captioning frameworks. Next, we employ the same fusion strategies to integrate a pretrained Masked Language Model (MLM), namely BERT, with a visual captioning model, viz. Show, Attend, and Tell, for emending both syntactic and semantic errors in captions. Our caption emendation experiments on three benchmark image captioning datasets, viz. Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MSCOCO, show improvements over the baseline, indicating the usefulness of our proposed multimodal fusion strategies. Further, we perform a preliminary qualitative analysis on the emended captions and identify error categories based on the type of corrections.\n",
      "Federated learning (FL) has attracted increasing attention in recent years. As a privacy-preserving collaborative learning paradigm, it enables a broader range of applications, especially for computer vision and natural language processing tasks. However, to date, there is limited research of federated learning on relational data, namely Knowledge Graph (KG). In this work, we present a modified version of the graph neural network algorithm that performs federated modeling over KGs across different participants. Specifically, to tackle the inherent data heterogeneity issue and inefficiency in algorithm convergence, we propose a novel optimization algorithm, named FedAlign, with 1) optimal transportation (OT) for on-client personalization and 2) weight constraint to speed up the convergence. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several widely used datasets. Empirical results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art FL methods, such as FedAVG and FedProx, with better convergence.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in sparse reward settings, often requires prohibitively large numbers of interactions with the environment, thereby limiting its applicability to complex problems. To address this, several prior approaches have used natural language to guide the agent's exploration. However, these approaches typically operate on structured representations of the environment, and/or assume some structure in the natural language commands. In this work, we propose a model that directly maps pixels to rewards, given a free-form natural language description of the task, which can then be used for policy learning. Our experiments on the Meta-World robot manipulation domain show that language-based rewards significantly improves the sample efficiency of policy learning, both in sparse and dense reward settings.\n",
      "Understanding images and text together is an important aspect of cognition and building advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. As a community, we have achieved good benchmarks over language and vision domains separately, however joint reasoning is still a challenge for state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) systems. We propose a novel task to derive joint inference about a given image-text modality and compile the Visuo-Linguistic Question Answering (VLQA) challenge corpus in a question answering setting. Each dataset item consists of an image and a reading passage, where questions are designed to combine both visual and textual information i.e., ignoring either modality would make the question unanswerable. We first explore the best existing vision-language architectures to solve VLQA subsets and show that they are unable to reason well. We then develop a modular method with slightly better baseline performance, but it is still far behind human performance. We believe that VLQA will be a good benchmark for reasoning over a visuo-linguistic context. The dataset, code and leaderboard is available at https://shailaja183.github.io/vlqa/.\n",
      "Dot-product attention has wide applications in computer vision and natural language processing. However, its memory and computational costs grow quadratically with the input size. Such growth prohibits its application on high-resolution inputs. To remedy this drawback, this paper proposes a novel efficient attention mechanism equivalent to dot-product attention but with substantially less memory and computational costs. Its resource efficiency allows more widespread and flexible integration of attention modules into a network, which leads to better accuracies. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of its advantages. Efficient attention modules brought significant performance boosts to object detectors and instance segmenters on MS-COCO 2017. Further, the resource efficiency democratizes attention to complex models, where high costs prohibit the use of dot-product attention. As an exemplar, a model with efficient attention achieved state-of-the-art accuracies for stereo depth estimation on the Scene Flow dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/cmsflash/efficient-attention.\n",
      "Every year physicians face an increasing demand of image-based diagnosis from patients, a problem that can be addressed with recent artificial intelligence methods. In this context, we survey works in the area of automatic report generation from medical images, with emphasis on methods using deep neural networks, with respect to: (1) Datasets, (2) Architecture Design, (3) Explainability and (4) Evaluation Metrics. Our survey identifies interesting developments, but also remaining challenges. Among them, the current evaluation of generated reports is especially weak, since it mostly relies on traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics, which do not accurately capture medical correctness.\n",
      "The quality of datasets is one of the key factors that affect the accuracy of aerodynamic data models. For example, in the uniformly sampled Burgers' dataset, the insufficient high-speed data is overwhelmed by massive low-speed data. Predicting high-speed data is more difficult than predicting low-speed data, owing to that the number of high-speed data is limited, i.e. the quality of the Burgers' dataset is not satisfactory. To improve the quality of datasets, traditional methods usually employ the data resampling technology to produce enough data for the insufficient parts in the original datasets before modeling, which increases computational costs. Recently, the mixtures of experts have been used in natural language processing to deal with different parts of sentences, which provides a solution for eliminating the need for data resampling in aerodynamic data modeling. Motivated by this, we propose the multi-task learning (MTL), a datasets quality-adaptive learning scheme, which combines task allocation and aerodynamic characteristics learning together to disperse the pressure of the entire learning task. The task allocation divides a whole learning task into several independent subtasks, while the aerodynamic characteristics learning learns these subtasks simultaneously to achieve better precision. Two experiments with poor quality datasets are conducted to verify the data quality-adaptivity of the MTL to datasets. The results show than the MTL is more accurate than FCNs and GANs in poor quality datasets.\n",
      "Sign language translation (SLT) aims to interpret sign video sequences into text-based natural language sentences. Sign videos consist of continuous sequences of sign gestures with no clear boundaries in between. Existing SLT models usually represent sign visual features in a frame-wise manner so as to avoid needing to explicitly segmenting the videos into isolated signs. However, these methods neglect the temporal information of signs and lead to substantial ambiguity in translation. In this paper, we explore the temporal semantic structures of signvideos to learn more discriminative features. To this end, we first present a novel sign video segment representation which takes into account multiple temporal granularities, thus alleviating the need for accurate video segmentation. Taking advantage of the proposed segment representation, we develop a novel hierarchical sign video feature learning method via a temporal semantic pyramid network, called TSPNet. Specifically, TSPNet introduces an inter-scale attention to evaluate and enhance local semantic consistency of sign segments and an intra-scale attention to resolve semantic ambiguity by using non-local video context. Experiments show that our TSPNet outperforms the state-of-the-art with significant improvements on the BLEU score (from 9.58 to 13.41) and ROUGE score (from 31.80 to 34.96)on the largest commonly-used SLT dataset. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/verashira/TSPNet.\n",
      "A visual relationship denotes a relationship between two objects in an image, which can be represented as a triplet of (subject; predicate; object). Visual relationship detection is crucial for scene understanding in images. Existing visual relationship detection datasets only contain true relationships that correctly describe the content in an image. However, distinguishing false visual relationships from true ones is also crucial for image understanding and grounded natural language processing. In this paper, we construct a visual relationship authenticity dataset, where both true and false relationships among all objects appeared in the captions in the Flickr30k entities image caption dataset are annotated. The dataset is available at https://github.com/codecreator2053/VR_ClassifiedDataset. We hope that this dataset can promote the study on both vision and language understanding.\n",
      "Natural language descriptions of user interface (UI) elements such as alternative text are crucial for accessibility and language-based interaction in general. Yet, these descriptions are constantly missing in mobile UIs. We propose widget captioning, a novel task for automatically generating language descriptions for UI elements from multimodal input including both the image and the structural representations of user interfaces. We collected a large-scale dataset for widget captioning with crowdsourcing. Our dataset contains 162,859 language phrases created by human workers for annotating 61,285 UI elements across 21,750 unique UI screens. We thoroughly analyze the dataset, and train and evaluate a set of deep model configurations to investigate how each feature modality as well as the choice of learning strategies impact the quality of predicted captions. The task formulation and the dataset as well as our benchmark models contribute a solid basis for this novel multimodal captioning task that connects language and user interfaces.\n",
      "Product descriptions in e-commerce platforms contain detailed and valuable information about retailers assortment. In particular, coding promotions within digital leaflets are of great interest in e-commerce as they capture the attention of consumers by showing regular promotions for different products. However, this information is embedded into images, making it difficult to extract and process for downstream tasks. In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach that classifies promotions within digital leaflets into their corresponding product categories using both visual and textual information. Our approach can be divided into three key components: 1) region detection, 2) text recognition and 3) text classification. In many cases, a single promotion refers to multiple product categories, so we introduce a multi-label objective in the classification head. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for two separated tasks: 1) image-based detection of the descriptions for each individual promotion and 2) multi-label classification of the product categories using the text from the product descriptions. We train and evaluate our models using a private dataset composed of images from digital leaflets obtained by Nielsen. Results show that we consistently outperform the proposed baseline by a large margin in all the experiments.\n",
      "Knowledge graph reasoning is a critical task in natural language processing. The task becomes more challenging on temporal knowledge graphs, where each fact is associated with a timestamp. Most existing methods focus on reasoning at past timestamps and they are not able to predict facts happening in the future. This paper proposes Recurrent Event Network (RE-NET), a novel autoregressive architecture for predicting future interactions. The occurrence of a fact (event) is modeled as a probability distribution conditioned on temporal sequences of past knowledge graphs. Specifically, our RE-NET employs a recurrent event encoder to encode past facts and uses a neighborhood aggregator to model the connection of facts at the same timestamp. Future facts can then be inferred in a sequential manner based on the two modules. We evaluate our proposed method via link prediction at future times on five public datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the strength of RENET, especially on multi-step inference over future timestamps, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on all five datasets. Code and data can be found at https://github.com/INK-USC/RE-Net.\n",
      "Machine learning models have been successfully applied to a wide range of applications including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. A successful implementation of these models however, usually relies on deep neural networks (DNNs) which are treated as opaque black-box systems due to their incomprehensible complexity and intricate internal mechanism. In this work, we present a novel algorithm for explaining the predictions of a DNN using adversarial machine learning. Our approach identifies the relative importance of input features in relation to the predictions based on the behavior of an adversarial attack on the DNN. Our algorithm has the advantage of being fast, consistent, and easy to implement and interpret. We present our detailed analysis that demonstrates how the behavior of an adversarial attack, given a DNN and a task, stays consistent for any input test data point proving the generality of our approach. Our analysis enables us to produce consistent and efficient explanations. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting experiments using a variety of DNNs, tasks, and datasets. Finally, we compare our work with other well-known techniques in the current literature.\n",
      "Recommendation has been a long-standing problem in many areas ranging from e-commerce to social websites. Most current studies focus only on traditional approaches such as content-based or collaborative filtering while there are relatively fewer studies in hybrid recommender systems. Due to the latest advances of deep learning achieved in different fields including computer vision and natural language processing, deep learning has also gained much attention in Recommendation Systems. There are several studies that utilize ID embeddings of users and items to implement collaborative filtering with deep neural networks. However, such studies do not take advantage of other categorical or continuous features of inputs. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network architecture which consists of not only ID embeddings but also auxiliary information such as features of job postings and candidates for job recommendation system which is a reciprocal recommendation system. Experimental results on the dataset from a job-site show that the proposed method improves recommendation results over deep learning models utilizing ID embeddings.\n",
      "The task of visual grounding requires locating the most relevant region or object in an image, given a natural language query. So far, progress on this task was mostly measured on curated datasets, which are not always representative of human spoken language. In this work, we deviate from recent, popular task settings and consider the problem under an autonomous vehicle scenario. In particular, we consider a situation where passengers can give free-form natural language commands to a vehicle which can be associated with an object in the street scene. To stimulate research on this topic, we have organized the \\emph{Commands for Autonomous Vehicles} (C4AV) challenge based on the recent \\emph{Talk2Car} dataset (URL: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/eccv-2020-commands-4-autonomous-vehicles). This paper presents the results of the challenge. First, we compare the used benchmark against existing datasets for visual grounding. Second, we identify the aspects that render top-performing models successful, and relate them to existing state-of-the-art models for visual grounding, in addition to detecting potential failure cases by evaluating on carefully selected subsets. Finally, we discuss several possibilities for future work.\n",
      "Memes are graphics and text overlapped so that together they present concepts that become dubious if one of them is absent. It is spread mostly on social media platforms, in the form of jokes, sarcasm, motivating, etc. After the success of BERT in Natural Language Processing (NLP), researchers inclined to Visual-Linguistic (VL) multimodal problems like memes classification, image captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), and many more. Unfortunately, many memes get uploaded each day on social media platforms that need automatic censoring to curb misinformation and hate. Recently, this issue has attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners. State-of-the-art methods that performed significantly on other VL dataset, tends to fail on memes classification. In this context, this work aims to conduct a comprehensive study on memes classification, generally on the VL multimodal problems and cutting edge solutions. We propose a generalized framework for VL problems. We cover the early and next-generation works on VL problems. Finally, we identify and articulate several open research issues and challenges. This is the first study that presents the generalized view of the advanced classification techniques concerning memes classification to the best of our knowledge. We believe this study presents a clear road-map for the Machine Learning (ML) research community to implement and enhance memes classification techniques.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a novel method for video moment retrieval (VMR) that achieves state of the arts (SOTA) performance on R@1 metrics and surpassing the SOTA on the high IoU metric (R@1, IoU=0.7).   First, we propose to use a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and further a cross-attention scheme to capture video/query interaction and long-range query dependencies from video context. The attention-based methods can develop frame-to-query interaction and query-to-frame interaction at arbitrary positions and the multi-head setting ensures the sufficient understanding of complicated dependencies. Our model has a simple architecture, which enables faster training and inference while maintaining .   Second, We also propose to use multiple task training objective consists of moment segmentation task, start/end distribution prediction and start/end location regression task. We have verified that start/end prediction are noisy due to annotator disagreement and joint training with moment segmentation task can provide richer information since frames inside the target clip are also utilized as positive training examples.   Third, we propose to use an early fusion approach, which achieves better performance at the cost of inference time. However, the inference time will not be a problem for our model since our model has a simple architecture which enables efficient training and inference.\n",
      "Online display advertising is growing rapidly in recent years thanks to the automation of the ad buying process. Real-time bidding (RTB) allows the automated trading of ad impressions between advertisers and publishers through real-time auctions. In order to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns, advertisers should deliver ads to the users who are highly likely to be converted (i.e., purchase, registration, website visit, etc.) in the near future. In this study, we introduce and examine different models for estimating the probability of a user converting, given their history of visited URLs. Inspired by natural language processing, we introduce three URL embedding models to compute semantically meaningful URL representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the different proposed representation and conversion prediction models, we have conducted experiments on real logged events collected from an advertising platform.\n",
      "Given a natural language query, teaching machines to ask clarifying questions is of immense utility in practical natural language processing systems. Such interactions could help in filling information gaps for better machine comprehension of the query. For the task of ranking clarification questions, we hypothesize that determining whether a clarification question pertains to a missing entry in a given post (on QA forums such as StackExchange) could be considered as a special case of Natural Language Inference (NLI), where both the post and the most relevant clarification question point to a shared latent piece of information or context. We validate this hypothesis by incorporating representations from a Siamese BERT model fine-tuned on NLI and Multi-NLI datasets into our models and demonstrate that our best performing model obtains a relative performance improvement of 40 percent and 60 percent respectively (on the key metric of Precision@1), over the state-of-the-art baseline(s) on the two evaluation sets of the StackExchange dataset, thereby, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art.\n",
      "Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning in general have demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning. Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the deep learning is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide \"obviously\" interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that (1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution, (2) insights into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices, and (3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically- and technically-grounded medical education are encouraged.\n",
      "The ability to perform effective planning is crucial for building an instruction-following agent. When navigating through a new environment, an agent is challenged with (1) connecting the natural language instructions with its progressively growing knowledge of the world; and (2) performing long-range planning and decision making in the form of effective exploration and error correction. Current methods are still limited on both fronts despite extensive efforts. In this paper, we introduce the Evolving Graphical Planner (EGP), a model that performs global planning for navigation based on raw sensory input. The model dynamically constructs a graphical representation, generalizes the action space to allow for more flexible decision making, and performs efficient planning on a proxy graph representation. We evaluate our model on a challenging Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task with photorealistic images and achieve superior performance compared to previous navigation architectures. For instance, we achieve a 53% success rate on the test split of the Room-to-Room navigation task through pure imitation learning, outperforming previous navigation architectures by up to 5%.\n",
      "In the real world, linguistic agents are also embodied agents: they perceive and act in the physical world. The notion of Language Grounding questions the interactions between language and embodiment: how do learning agents connect or ground linguistic representations to the physical world ? This question has recently been approached by the Reinforcement Learning community under the framework of instruction-following agents. In these agents, behavioral policies or reward functions are conditioned on the embedding of an instruction expressed in natural language. This paper proposes another approach: using language to condition goal generators. Given any goal-conditioned policy, one could train a language-conditioned goal generator to generate language-agnostic goals for the agent. This method allows to decouple sensorimotor learning from language acquisition and enable agents to demonstrate a diversity of behaviors for any given instruction. We propose a particular instantiation of this approach and demonstrate its benefits.\n",
      "Machine Learning and Inference methods have become ubiquitous in our attempt to induce more abstract representations of natural language text, visual scenes, and other messy, naturally occurring data, and support decisions that depend on it. However, learning models for these tasks is difficult partly because generating the necessary supervision signals for it is costly and does not scale. This paper describes several learning paradigms that are designed to alleviate the supervision bottleneck. It will illustrate their benefit in the context of multiple problems, all pertaining to inducing various levels of semantic representations from text.\n",
      "In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the number of complex documents and texts that require a deeper understanding of machine learning methods to be able to accurately classify texts in many applications. Many machine learning approaches have achieved surpassing results in natural language processing. The success of these learning algorithms relies on their capacity to understand complex models and non-linear relationships within data. However, finding suitable structures, architectures, and techniques for text classification is a challenge for researchers. In this paper, a brief overview of text classification algorithms is discussed. This overview covers different text feature extractions, dimensionality reduction methods, existing algorithms and techniques, and evaluations methods. Finally, the limitations of each technique and their application in the real-world problem are discussed.\n",

We introduce the Touchdown task and dataset, where an agent must first follow navigation instructions in a real-life visual urban environment, and then identify a location described in natural language to find a hidden object at the goal position. The data contains 9,326 examples of English instructions and spatial descriptions paired with demonstrations. Empirical analysis shows the data presents an open challenge to existing methods, and qualitative linguistic analysis shows that the data displays richer use of spatial reasoning compared to related resources.\n",
      "We present the task of Spatio-Temporal Video Question Answering, which requires intelligent systems to simultaneously retrieve relevant moments and detect referenced visual concepts (people and objects) to answer natural language questions about videos. We first augment the TVQA dataset with 310.8K bounding boxes, linking depicted objects to visual concepts in questions and answers. We name this augmented version as TVQA+. We then propose Spatio-Temporal Answerer with Grounded Evidence (STAGE), a unified framework that grounds evidence in both spatial and temporal domains to answer questions about videos. Comprehensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and how the rich annotations in our TVQA+ dataset can contribute to the question answering task.

      "Existing attention mechanisms are trained to attend to individual items in a collection (the memory) with a predefined, fixed granularity, e.g., a word token or an image grid. We propose area attention: a way to attend to areas in the memory, where each area contains a group of items that are structurally adjacent, e.g., spatially for a 2D memory such as images, or temporally for a 1D memory such as natural language sentences. Importantly, the shape and the size of an area are dynamically determined via learning, which enables a model to attend to information with varying granularity. Area attention can easily work with existing model architectures such as multi-head attention for simultaneously attending to multiple areas in the memory. We evaluate area attention on two tasks: neural machine translation (both character and token-level) and image captioning, and improve upon strong (state-of-the-art) baselines in all the cases. These improvements are obtainable with a basic form of area attention that is parameter free.\n",
      "The recent developments and growing interest in neural-symbolic models has shown that hybrid approaches can offer richer models for Artificial Intelligence. The integration of effective relational learning and reasoning methods is one of the key challenges in this direction, as neural learning and symbolic reasoning offer complementary characteristics that can benefit the development of AI systems. Relational labelling or link prediction on knowledge graphs has become one of the main problems in deep learning-based natural language processing research. Moreover, other fields which make use of neural-symbolic techniques may also benefit from such research endeavours. There have been several efforts towards the identification of missing facts from existing ones in knowledge graphs. Two lines of research try and predict knowledge relations between two entities by considering all known facts connecting them or several paths of facts connecting them. We propose a neural-symbolic graph neural network which applies learning over all the paths by feeding the model with the embedding of the minimal subset of the knowledge graph containing such paths. By learning to produce representations for entities and facts corresponding to word embeddings, we show how the model can be trained end-to-end to decode these representations and infer relations between entities in a multitask approach. Our contribution is two-fold: a neural-symbolic methodology leverages the resolution of relational inference in large graphs, and we also demonstrate that such neural-symbolic model is shown more effective than path-based approaches\n",
      "Multi-task learning (mtl) provides state-of-the-art results in many applications of computer vision and natural language processing. In contrast to single-task learning (stl), mtl allows for leveraging knowledge between related tasks improving prediction results on the main task (in contrast to an auxiliary task) or all tasks. However, there is a limited number of comparative studies on applying mtl architectures for regression and time series problems taking recent advances of mtl into account. An interesting, non-linear problem is the forecast of the expected power generation for renewable power plants. Therefore, this article provides a comparative study of the following recent and important mtl architectures: Hard parameter sharing, cross-stitch network, sluice network (sn). They are compared to a multi-layer perceptron model of similar size in an stl setting. Additionally, we provide a simple, yet effective approach to model task specific information through an embedding layer in an multi-layer perceptron, referred to as task embedding. Further, we introduce a new mtl architecture named emerging relation network (ern), which can be considered as an extension of the sluice network. For a solar power dataset, the task embedding achieves the best mean improvement with 14.9%. The mean improvement of the ern and the sn on the solar dataset is of similar magnitude with 14.7% and 14.8%. On a wind power dataset, only the ern achieves a significant improvement of up to 7.7%. Results suggest that the ern is beneficial when tasks are only loosely related and the prediction problem is more non-linear. Contrary, the proposed task embedding is advantageous when tasks are strongly correlated. Further, the task embedding provides an effective approach with reduced computational effort compared to other mtl architectures.\n",
      "Recent developments in image classification and natural language processing, coupled with the rapid growth in social media usage, have enabled fundamental advances in detecting breaking events around the world in real-time. Emergency response is one such area that stands to gain from these advances. By processing billions of texts and images a minute, events can be automatically detected to enable emergency response workers to better assess rapidly evolving situations and deploy resources accordingly. To date, most event detection techniques in this area have focused on image-only or text-only approaches, limiting detection performance and impacting the quality of information delivered to crisis response teams. In this paper, we present a new multimodal fusion method that leverages both images and texts as input. In particular, we introduce a cross-attention module that can filter uninformative and misleading components from weak modalities on a sample by sample basis. In addition, we employ a multimodal graph-based approach to stochastically transition between embeddings of different multimodal pairs during training to better regularize the learning process as well as dealing with limited training data by constructing new matched pairs from different samples. We show that our method outperforms the unimodal approaches and strong multimodal baselines by a large margin on three crisis-related tasks.\n",
      "In this paper we present an approach and a benchmark for visual reasoning in robotics applications, in particular small object grasping and manipulation. The approach and benchmark are focused on inferring object properties from visual and text data. It concerns small household objects with their properties, functionality, natural language descriptions as well as question-answer pairs for visual reasoning queries along with their corresponding scene semantic representations. We also present a method for generating synthetic data which allows to extend the benchmark to other objects or scenes and propose an evaluation protocol that is more challenging than in the existing datasets. We propose a reasoning system based on symbolic program execution. A disentangled representation of the visual and textual inputs is obtained and used to execute symbolic programs that represent a 'reasoning process' of the algorithm. We perform a set of experiments on the proposed benchmark and compare to results for the state of the art methods. These results expose the shortcomings of the existing benchmarks that may lead to misleading conclusions on the actual performance of the visual reasoning systems.\n",
      "A sum-product network (SPN) is a probabilistic model, based on a rooted acyclic directed graph, in which terminal nodes represent univariate probability distributions and non-terminal nodes represent convex combinations (weighted sums) and products of probability functions. They are closely related to probabilistic graphical models, in particular to Bayesian networks with multiple context-specific independencies. Their main advantage is the possibility of building tractable models from data, i.e., models that can perform several inference tasks in time proportional to the number of links in the graph. They are somewhat similar to neural networks and can address the same kinds of problems, such as image processing and natural language understanding. This paper offers a survey of SPNs, including their definition, the main algorithms for inference and learning from data, the main applications, a brief review of software libraries, and a comparison with related models\n",
      "We present ALFRED (Action Learning From Realistic Environments and Directives), a benchmark for learning a mapping from natural language instructions and egocentric vision to sequences of actions for household tasks. ALFRED includes long, compositional tasks with non-reversible state changes to shrink the gap between research benchmarks and real-world applications. ALFRED consists of expert demonstrations in interactive visual environments for 25k natural language directives. These directives contain both high-level goals like \"Rinse off a mug and place it in the coffee maker.\" and low-level language instructions like \"Walk to the coffee maker on the right.\" ALFRED tasks are more complex in terms of sequence length, action space, and language than existing vision-and-language task datasets. We show that a baseline model based on recent embodied vision-and-language tasks performs poorly on ALFRED, suggesting that there is significant room for developing innovative grounded visual language understanding models with this benchmark.\n",
      "We introduce a new task, Video-and-Language Inference, for joint multimodal understanding of video and text. Given a video clip with aligned subtitles as premise, paired with a natural language hypothesis based on the video content, a model needs to infer whether the hypothesis is entailed or contradicted by the given video clip. A new large-scale dataset, named Violin (VIdeO-and-Language INference), is introduced for this task, which consists of 95,322 video-hypothesis pairs from 15,887 video clips, spanning over 582 hours of video. These video clips contain rich content with diverse temporal dynamics, event shifts, and people interactions, collected from two sources: (i) popular TV shows, and (ii) movie clips from YouTube channels. In order to address our new multimodal inference task, a model is required to possess sophisticated reasoning skills, from surface-level grounding (e.g., identifying objects and characters in the video) to in-depth commonsense reasoning (e.g., inferring causal relations of events in the video). We present a detailed analysis of the dataset and an extensive evaluation over many strong baselines, providing valuable insights on the challenges of this new task.\n",
      "This paper investigates the idea of encoding object-centered representations in the design of the reward function and policy architectures of a language-guided reinforcement learning agent. This is done using a combination of object-wise permutation invariant networks inspired from Deep Sets and gated-attention mechanisms. In a 2D procedurally-generated world where agents targeting goals in natural language navigate and interact with objects, we show that these architectures demonstrate strong generalization capacities to out-of-distribution goals. We study the generalization to varying numbers of objects at test time and further extend the object-centered architectures to goals involving relational reasoning.\n",
      "Text-based games -- in which an agent interacts with the world through textual natural language -- present us with the problem of combinatorially-sized action-spaces. Most current reinforcement learning algorithms are not capable of effectively handling such a large number of possible actions per turn. Poor sample efficiency, consequently, results in agents that are unable to pass bottleneck states, where they are unable to proceed because they do not see the right action sequence to pass the bottleneck enough times to be sufficiently reinforced. Building on prior work using knowledge graphs in reinforcement learning, we introduce two new game state exploration strategies. We compare our exploration strategies against strong baselines on the classic text-adventure game, Zork1, where prior agent have been unable to get past a bottleneck where the agent is eaten by a Grue.\n",
      "Interactive Fiction games are text-based simulations in which an agent interacts with the world purely through natural language. They are ideal environments for studying how to extend reinforcement learning agents to meet the challenges of natural language understanding, partial observability, and action generation in combinatorially-large text-based action spaces. We present KG-A2C, an agent that builds a dynamic knowledge graph while exploring and generates actions using a template-based action space. We contend that the dual uses of the knowledge graph to reason about game state and to constrain natural language generation are the keys to scalable exploration of combinatorially large natural language actions. Results across a wide variety of IF games show that KG-A2C outperforms current IF agents despite the exponential increase in action space size.\n",
      "Significant advances have been made in artificial systems by using biological systems as a guide. However, there is often little interaction between computational models for emergent communication and biological models of the emergence of language. Many researchers in language origins and emergent communication take compositionality as their primary target for explaining how simple communication systems can become more like natural language. However, there is reason to think that compositionality is the wrong target on the biological side, and so too the wrong target on the machine-learning side. As such, the purpose of this paper is to explore this claim. This has theoretical implications for language origins research more generally, but the focus here will be the implications for research on emergent communication in computer science and machine learning---specifically regarding the types of programmes that might be expected to work and those which will not. I further suggest an alternative approach for future research which focuses on reflexivity, rather than compositionality, as a target for explaining how simple communication systems may become more like natural language. I end by providing some reference to the language origins literature that may be of some use to researchers in machine learning.\n",
      "We present a first attempt to elucidate a theoretical and empirical approach to design the reward provided by a natural language environment to some structure learning agent. To this end, we revisit the Information Theory of unsupervised induction of phrase-structure grammars to characterize the behavior of simulated actions modeled as set-valued random variables (random sets of linguistic samples) constituting semantic structures. Our results showed empirical evidence of that simulated semantic structures (Open Information Extraction triplets) can be distinguished from randomly constructed ones by observing the Mutual Information among their constituents. This suggests the possibility of rewarding structure learning agents without using pretrained structural analyzers (oracle actors/experts).\n",
      "The massive progress of machine learning has seen its application over a variety of domains in the past decade. But how do we develop a systematic, scalable and modular strategy to validate machine-learning systems? We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach, which provides a systematic test framework for machine-learning systems that accepts grammar-based inputs. Our OGMA approach automatically discovers erroneous behaviours in classifiers and leverages these erroneous behaviours to improve the respective models. OGMA leverages inherent robustness properties present in any well trained machine-learning model to direct test generation and thus, implementing a scalable test generation methodology. To evaluate our OGMA approach, we have tested it on three real world natural language processing (NLP) classifiers. We have found thousands of erroneous behaviours in these systems. We also compare OGMA with a random test generation approach and observe that OGMA is more effective than such random test generation by up to 489%.\n",
      "Program synthesis of general-purpose source code from natural language specifications is challenging due to the need to reason about high-level patterns in the target program and low-level implementation details at the same time. In this work, we present PATOIS, a system that allows a neural program synthesizer to explicitly interleave high-level and low-level reasoning at every generation step. It accomplishes this by automatically mining common code idioms from a given corpus, incorporating them into the underlying language for neural synthesis, and training a tree-based neural synthesizer to use these idioms during code generation. We evaluate PATOIS on two complex semantic parsing datasets and show that using learned code idioms improves the synthesizer's accuracy.\n",
      "Owing to their ability to both effectively integrate information over long time horizons and scale to massive amounts of data, self-attention architectures have recently shown breakthrough success in natural language processing (NLP), achieving state-of-the-art results in domains such as language modeling and machine translation. Harnessing the transformer's ability to process long time horizons of information could provide a similar performance boost in partially observable reinforcement learning (RL) domains, but the large-scale transformers used in NLP have yet to be successfully applied to the RL setting. In this work we demonstrate that the standard transformer architecture is difficult to optimize, which was previously observed in the supervised learning setting but becomes especially pronounced with RL objectives. We propose architectural modifications that substantially improve the stability and learning speed of the original Transformer and XL variant. The proposed architecture, the Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL), surpasses LSTMs on challenging memory environments and achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-task DMLab-30 benchmark suite, exceeding the performance of an external memory architecture. We show that the GTrXL, trained using the same losses, has stability and performance that consistently matches or exceeds a competitive LSTM baseline, including on more reactive tasks where memory is less critical. GTrXL offers an easy-to-train, simple-to-implement but substantially more expressive architectural alternative to the standard multi-layer LSTM ubiquitously used for RL agents in partially observable environments.\n",
      "This paper explores a novel approach to achieving emergent compositional communication in multi-agent systems. We propose a training regime implementing template transfer, the idea of carrying over learned biases across contexts. In our method, a sender-receiver pair is first trained with disentangled loss functions and then the receiver is transferred to train a new sender with a standard loss. Unlike other methods (e.g. the obverter algorithm), our approach does not require imposing inductive biases on the architecture of the agents. We experimentally show the emergence of compositional communication using topographical similarity, zero-shot generalization and context independence as evaluation metrics. The presented approach is connected to an important line of work in semiotics and developmental psycholinguistics: it supports a conjecture that compositional communication is scaffolded on simpler communication protocols.\n",
      "We present SentiMATE, a novel end-to-end Deep Learning model for Chess, employing Natural Language Processing that aims to learn an effective evaluation function assessing move quality. This function is pre-trained on the sentiment of commentary associated with the training moves and is used to guide and optimize the agent's game-playing decision making. The contributions of this research are three-fold: we build and put forward both a classifier which extracts commentary describing the quality of Chess moves in vast commentary datasets, and a Sentiment Analysis model trained on Chess commentary to accurately predict the quality of said moves, to then use those predictions to evaluate the optimal next move of a Chess agent. Both classifiers achieve over 90 % classification accuracy. Lastly, we present a Chess engine, SentiMATE, which evaluates Chess moves based on a pre-trained sentiment evaluation function. Our results exhibit strong evidence to support our initial hypothesis - \"Can Natural Language Processing be used to train a novel and sample efficient evaluation function in Chess Engines?\" - as we integrate our evaluation function into modern Chess engines and play against agents with traditional Chess move evaluation functions, beating both random agents and a DeepChess implementation at a level-one search depth - representing the number of moves a traditional Chess agent (employing the alpha-beta search algorithm) looks ahead in order to evaluate a given chess state.\n",
      "Standard autoregressive seq2seq models are easily trained by max-likelihood, but tend to show poor results under small-data conditions. We introduce a class of seq2seq models, GAMs (Global Autoregressive Models), which combine an autoregressive component with a log-linear component, allowing the use of global \\textit{a priori} features to compensate for lack of data. We train these models in two steps. In the first step, we obtain an \\emph{unnormalized} GAM that maximizes the likelihood of the data, but is improper for fast inference or evaluation. In the second step, we use this GAM to train (by distillation) a second autoregressive model that approximates the \\emph{normalized} distribution associated with the GAM, and can be used for fast inference and evaluation. Our experiments focus on language modelling under synthetic conditions and show a strong perplexity reduction of using the second autoregressive model over the standard one.\n",
      "Personal assistant AI systems such as Siri, Cortana, and Alexa have become widely used as a means to accomplish tasks through natural language commands. However, components in these systems generally rely on supervised machine learning algorithms that require large amounts of hand-annotated training data, which is expensive and time consuming to collect. The ability to incorporate unsupervised, weakly supervised, or distantly supervised data holds significant promise in overcoming this bottleneck. In this paper, we describe a framework that leverages user engagement signals (user behaviors that demonstrate a positive or negative response to content) to automatically create granular entity labels for training data augmentation. Strategies such as multi-task learning and validation using an external knowledge base are employed to incorporate the engagement annotated data and to boost the model's accuracy on a sequence labeling task. Our results show that learning from data automatically labeled by user engagement signals achieves significant accuracy gains in a production deep learning system, when measured on both the sequence labeling task as well as on user facing results produced by the system end-to-end. We believe this is the first use of user engagement signals to help generate training data for a sequence labeling task on a large scale, and can be applied in practical settings to speed up new feature deployment when little human annotated data is available.\n",
      "While models for Visual Question Answering (VQA) have steadily improved over the years, interacting with one quickly reveals that these models lack consistency. For instance, if a model answers \"red\" to \"What color is the balloon?\", it might answer \"no\" if asked, \"Is the balloon red?\". These responses violate simple notions of entailment and raise questions about how effectively VQA models ground language. In this work, we introduce a dataset, ConVQA, and metrics that enable quantitative evaluation of consistency in VQA. For a given observable fact in an image (e.g. the balloon's color), we generate a set of logically consistent question-answer (QA) pairs (e.g. Is the balloon red?) and also collect a human-annotated set of common-sense based consistent QA pairs (e.g. Is the balloon the same color as tomato sauce?). Further, we propose a consistency-improving data augmentation module, a Consistency Teacher Module (CTM). CTM automatically generates entailed (or similar-intent) questions for a source QA pair and fine-tunes the VQA model if the VQA's answer to the entailed question is consistent with the source QA pair. We demonstrate that our CTM-based training improves the consistency of VQA models on the ConVQA datasets and is a strong baseline for further research.\n",
      "Recently, kernelized locality sensitive hashcodes have been successfully employed as representations of natural language text, especially showing high relevance to biomedical relation extraction tasks. In this paper, we propose to optimize the hashcode representations in a nearly unsupervised manner, in which we only use data points, but not their class labels, for learning. The optimized hashcode representations are then fed to a supervised classifier following the prior work. This nearly unsupervised approach allows fine-grained optimization of each hash function, which is particularly suitable for building hashcode representations generalizing from a training set to a test set. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach for biomedical relation extraction tasks, obtaining significant accuracy improvements w.r.t. state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised approaches.\n",
      "Visualization refers to our ability to create an image in our head based on the text we read or the words we hear. It is one of the many skills that makes reading comprehension possible. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are an excellent tool for recognizing and classifying text documents. In addition, it can generate images conditioned on natural language. In this work, we utilize CNNs capabilities to generate realistic images representative of the text illustrating the semantic concept. We conducted various experiments to highlight the capacity of the proposed model to generate representative images of the text descriptions used as input to the proposed model.\n",
      "While Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches lead to significant achievements in a variety of areas in recent history, natural language tasks remained mostly unaffected, due to the compositional and combinatorial nature that makes them notoriously hard to optimize. With the emerging field of Text-Based Games (TBGs), researchers try to bridge this gap. Inspired by the success of RL algorithms on Atari games, the idea is to develop new methods in a restricted game world and then gradually move to more complex environments. Previous work in the area of TBGs has mainly focused on solving individual games. We, however, consider the task of designing an agent that not just succeeds in a single game, but performs well across a whole family of games, sharing the same theme. In this work, we present our deep RL agent--LeDeepChef--that shows generalization capabilities to never-before-seen games of the same family with different environments and task descriptions. The agent participated in Microsoft Research's \"First TextWorld Problems: A Language and Reinforcement Learning Challenge\" and outperformed all but one competitor on the final test set. The games from the challenge all share the same theme, namely cooking in a modern house environment, but differ significantly in the arrangement of the rooms, the presented objects, and the specific goal (recipe to cook). To build an agent that achieves high scores across a whole family of games, we use an actor-critic framework and prune the action-space by using ideas from hierarchical reinforcement learning and a specialized module trained on a recipe database.\n",
      "The sample inefficiency of standard deep reinforcement learning methods precludes their application to many real-world problems. Methods which leverage human demonstrations require fewer samples but have been researched less. As demonstrated in the computer vision and natural language processing communities, large-scale datasets have the capacity to facilitate research by serving as an experimental and benchmarking platform for new methods. However, existing datasets compatible with reinforcement learning simulators do not have sufficient scale, structure, and quality to enable the further development and evaluation of methods focused on using human examples. Therefore, we introduce a comprehensive, large-scale, simulator-paired dataset of human demonstrations: MineRL. The dataset consists of over 60 million automatically annotated state-action pairs across a variety of related tasks in Minecraft, a dynamic, 3D, open-world environment. We present a novel data collection scheme which allows for the ongoing introduction of new tasks and the gathering of complete state information suitable for a variety of methods. We demonstrate the hierarchality, diversity, and scale of the MineRL dataset. Further, we show the difficulty of the Minecraft domain along with the potential of MineRL in developing techniques to solve key research challenges within it.\n",
      "Generating textual descriptions for images has been an attractive problem for the computer vision and natural language processing researchers in recent years. Dozens of models based on deep learning have been proposed to solve this problem. The existing approaches are based on neural encoder-decoder structures equipped with the attention mechanism. These methods strive to train decoders to minimize the log likelihood of the next word in a sentence given the previous ones, which results in the sparsity of the output space. In this work, we propose a new approach to train decoders to regress the word embedding of the next word with respect to the previous ones instead of minimizing the log likelihood. The proposed method is able to learn and extract long-term information and can generate longer fine-grained captions without introducing any external memory cell. Furthermore, decoders trained by the proposed technique can take the importance of the generated words into consideration while generating captions. In addition, a novel semantic attention mechanism is proposed that guides attention points through the image, taking the meaning of the previously generated word into account. We evaluate the proposed approach with the MS-COCO dataset. The proposed model outperformed the state of the art models especially in generating longer captions. It achieved a CIDEr score equal to 125.0 and a BLEU-4 score equal to 50.5, while the best scores of the state of the art models are 117.1 and 48.0, respectively.\n",
      "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) with an auto-regressive decoder have been applied for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The VAE objective consists of two terms, (i) reconstruction and (ii) KL regularization, balanced by a weighting hyper-parameter \\beta. One notorious training difficulty is that the KL term tends to vanish. In this paper we study scheduling schemes for \\beta, and show that KL vanishing is caused by the lack of good latent codes in training the decoder at the beginning of optimization. To remedy this, we propose a cyclical annealing schedule, which repeats the process of increasing \\beta multiple times. This new procedure allows the progressive learning of more meaningful latent codes, by leveraging the informative representations of previous cycles as warm re-starts. The effectiveness of cyclical annealing is validated on a broad range of NLP tasks, including language modeling, dialog response generation and unsupervised language pre-training.\n",
      "In this work, we propose a goal-driven collaborative task that combines language, perception, and action. Specifically, we develop a Collaborative image-Drawing game between two agents, called CoDraw. Our game is grounded in a virtual world that contains movable clip art objects. The game involves two players: a Teller and a Drawer. The Teller sees an abstract scene containing multiple clip art pieces in a semantically meaningful configuration, while the Drawer tries to reconstruct the scene on an empty canvas using available clip art pieces. The two players communicate with each other using natural language. We collect the CoDraw dataset of ~10K dialogs consisting of ~138K messages exchanged between human players. We define protocols and metrics to evaluate learned agents in this testbed, highlighting the need for a novel \"crosstalk\" evaluation condition which pairs agents trained independently on disjoint subsets of the training data. We present models for our task and benchmark them using both fully automated evaluation and by having them play the game live with humans.\n",
      "We consider the problem of learning from sparse and underspecified rewards, where an agent receives a complex input, such as a natural language instruction, and needs to generate a complex response, such as an action sequence, while only receiving binary success-failure feedback. Such success-failure rewards are often underspecified: they do not distinguish between purposeful and accidental success. Generalization from underspecified rewards hinges on discounting spurious trajectories that attain accidental success, while learning from sparse feedback requires effective exploration. We address exploration by using a mode covering direction of KL divergence to collect a diverse set of successful trajectories, followed by a mode seeking KL divergence to train a robust policy. We propose Meta Reward Learning (MeRL) to construct an auxiliary reward function that provides more refined feedback for learning. The parameters of the auxiliary reward function are optimized with respect to the validation performance of a trained policy. The MeRL approach outperforms our alternative reward learning technique based on Bayesian Optimization, and achieves the state-of-the-art on weakly-supervised semantic parsing. It improves previous work by 1.2% and 2.4% on WikiTableQuestions and WikiSQL datasets respectively.\n",
      "Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown strong performance in complex domains such as Atari games, but are often highly sample inefficient. A common approach to reduce interaction time with the environment is to use reward shaping, which involves carefully designing reward functions that provide the agent intermediate rewards for progress towards the goal. However, designing appropriate shaping rewards is known to be difficult as well as time-consuming. In this work, we address this problem by using natural language instructions to perform reward shaping. We propose the LanguagE-Action Reward Network (LEARN), a framework that maps free-form natural language instructions to intermediate rewards based on actions taken by the agent. These intermediate language-based rewards can seamlessly be integrated into any standard reinforcement learning algorithm. We experiment with Montezuma's Revenge from the Atari Learning Environment, a popular benchmark in RL. Our experiments on a diverse set of 15 tasks demonstrate that, for the same number of interactions with the environment, language-based rewards lead to successful completion of the task 60% more often on average, compared to learning without language.\n",
      "In this work we present a new efficient approach to Human Action Recognition called Video Transformer Network (VTN). It leverages the latest advances in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing and applies them to video understanding. The proposed method allows us to create lightweight CNN models that achieve high accuracy and real-time speed using just an RGB mono camera and general purpose CPU. Furthermore, we explain how to improve accuracy by distilling from multiple models with different modalities into a single model. We conduct a comparison with state-of-the-art methods and show that our approach performs on par with most of them on famous Action Recognition datasets. We benchmark the inference time of the models using the modern inference framework and argue that our approach compares favorably with other methods in terms of speed/accuracy trade-off, running at 56 FPS on CPU. The models and the training code are available.\n",
      "Neural networks (NN) are considered as black-boxes due to the lack of explainability and transparency of their decisions. This significantly hampers their deployment in environments where explainability is essential along with the accuracy of the system. Recently, significant efforts have been made for the interpretability of these deep networks with the aim to open up the black-box. However, most of these approaches are specifically developed for visual modalities. In addition, the interpretations provided by these systems require expert knowledge and understanding for intelligibility. This indicates a vital gap between the explainability provided by the systems and the novice user. To bridge this gap, we present a novel framework i.e. Time-Series eXplanation (TSXplain) system which produces a natural language based explanation of the decision taken by a NN. It uses the extracted statistical features to describe the decision of a NN, merging the deep learning world with that of statistics. The two-level explanation provides ample description of the decision made by the network to aid an expert as well as a novice user alike. Our survey and reliability assessment test confirm that the generated explanations are meaningful and correct. We believe that generating natural language based descriptions of the network's decisions is a big step towards opening up the black-box.\n",
      "Domain classification is the task of mapping spoken language utterances to one of the natural language understanding domains in intelligent personal digital assistants (IPDAs). This is a major component in mainstream IPDAs in industry. Apart from official domains, thousands of third-party domains are also created by external developers to enhance the capability of IPDAs. As more domains are developed rapidly, the question of how to continuously accommodate the new domains still remains challenging. Moreover, existing continual learning approaches do not address the problem of incorporating personalized information dynamically for better domain classification. In this paper, we propose CoNDA, a neural network based approach for domain classification that supports incremental learning of new classes. Empirical evaluation shows that CoNDA achieves high accuracy and outperforms baselines by a large margin on both incrementally added new domains and existing domains.\n",
      "Describing what has changed in a scene can be useful to a user, but only if generated text focuses on what is semantically relevant. It is thus important to distinguish distractors (e.g. a viewpoint change) from relevant changes (e.g. an object has moved). We present a novel Dual Dynamic Attention Model (DUDA) to perform robust Change Captioning. Our model learns to distinguish distractors from semantic changes, localize the changes via Dual Attention over \"before\" and \"after\" images, and accurately describe them in natural language via Dynamic Speaker, by adaptively focusing on the necessary visual inputs (e.g. \"before\" or \"after\" image). To study the problem in depth, we collect a CLEVR-Change dataset, built off the CLEVR engine, with 5 types of scene changes. We benchmark a number of baselines on our dataset, and systematically study different change types and robustness to distractors. We show the superiority of our DUDA model in terms of both change captioning and localization. We also show that our approach is general, obtaining state-of-the-art results on the recent realistic Spot-the-Diff dataset which has no distractors.\n",
      "Deep learning models have lately shown great performance in various fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, speech translation, and natural language processing. However, alongside their state-of-the-art performance, it is still generally unclear what is the source of their generalization ability. Thus, an important question is what makes deep neural networks able to generalize well from the training set to new data. In this article, we provide an overview of the existing theory and bounds for the characterization of the generalization error of deep neural networks, combining both classical and more recent theoretical and empirical results.\n",
      "Vision-language navigation (VLN) is the task of navigating an embodied agent to carry out natural language instructions inside real 3D environments. In this paper, we study how to address three critical challenges for this task: the cross-modal grounding, the ill-posed feedback, and the generalization problems. First, we propose a novel Reinforced Cross-Modal Matching (RCM) approach that enforces cross-modal grounding both locally and globally via reinforcement learning (RL). Particularly, a matching critic is used to provide an intrinsic reward to encourage global matching between instructions and trajectories, and a reasoning navigator is employed to perform cross-modal grounding in the local visual scene. Evaluation on a VLN benchmark dataset shows that our RCM model significantly outperforms previous methods by 10% on SPL and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance. To improve the generalizability of the learned policy, we further introduce a Self-Supervised Imitation Learning (SIL) method to explore unseen environments by imitating its own past, good decisions. We demonstrate that SIL can approximate a better and more efficient policy, which tremendously minimizes the success rate performance gap between seen and unseen environments (from 30.7% to 11.7%).\n",
      "Deep learning techniques are rapidly advanced recently, and becoming a necessity component for widespread systems. However, the inference process of deep learning is black-box, and not very suitable to safety-critical systems which must exhibit high transparency. In this paper, to address this black-box limitation, we develop a simple analysis method which consists of 1) structural feature analysis: lists of the features contributing to inference process, 2) linguistic feature analysis: lists of the natural language labels describing the visual attributes for each feature contributing to inference process, and 3) consistency analysis: measuring consistency among input data, inference (label), and the result of our structural and linguistic feature analysis. Our analysis is simplified to reflect the actual inference process for high transparency, whereas it does not include any additional black-box mechanisms such as LSTM for highly human readable results. We conduct experiments and discuss the results of our analysis qualitatively and quantitatively, and come to believe that our work improves the transparency of neural networks. Evaluated through 12,800 human tasks, 75% workers answer that input data and result of our feature analysis are consistent, and 70% workers answer that inference (label) and result of our feature analysis are consistent. In addition to the evaluation of the proposed analysis, we find that our analysis also provide suggestions, or possible next actions such as expanding neural network complexity or collecting training data to improve a neural network.\n",
      "Program synthesis from natural language (NL) is practical for humans and, once technically feasible, would significantly facilitate software development and revolutionize end-user programming. We present SAPS, an end-to-end neural network capable of mapping relatively complex, multi-sentence NL specifications to snippets of executable code. The proposed architecture relies exclusively on neural components, and is trained on abstract syntax trees, combined with a pretrained word embedding and a bi-directional multi-layer LSTM for processing of word sequences. The decoder features a doubly-recurrent LSTM, for which we propose novel signal propagation schemes and soft attention mechanism. When applied to a large dataset of problems proposed in a previous study, SAPS performs on par with or better than the method proposed there, producing correct programs in over 92% of cases. In contrast to other methods, it does not require post-processing of the resulting programs, and uses a fixed-dimensional latent representation as the only interface between the NL analyzer and the source code generator.\n",
      "Sparse reward is one of the most challenging problems in reinforcement learning (RL). Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) attempts to address this issue by converting a failed experience to a successful one by relabeling the goals. Despite its effectiveness, HER has limited applicability because it lacks a compact and universal goal representation. We present Augmenting experienCe via TeacheR's adviCE (ACTRCE), an efficient reinforcement learning technique that extends the HER framework using natural language as the goal representation. We first analyze the differences among goal representation, and show that ACTRCE can efficiently solve difficult reinforcement learning problems in challenging 3D navigation tasks, whereas HER with non-language goal representation failed to learn. We also show that with language goal representations, the agent can generalize to unseen instructions, and even generalize to instructions with unseen lexicons. We further demonstrate it is crucial to use hindsight advice to solve challenging tasks, and even small amount of advice is sufficient for the agent to achieve good performance.\n",
      "Behavioral skills or policies for autonomous agents are conventionally learned from reward functions, via reinforcement learning, or from demonstrations, via imitation learning. However, both modes of task specification have their disadvantages: reward functions require manual engineering, while demonstrations require a human expert to be able to actually perform the task in order to generate the demonstration. Instruction following from natural language instructions provides an appealing alternative: in the same way that we can specify goals to other humans simply by speaking or writing, we would like to be able to specify tasks for our machines. However, a single instruction may be insufficient to fully communicate our intent or, even if it is, may be insufficient for an autonomous agent to actually understand how to perform the desired task. In this work, we propose an interactive formulation of the task specification problem, where iterative language corrections are provided to an autonomous agent, guiding it in acquiring the desired skill. Our proposed language-guided policy learning algorithm can integrate an instruction and a sequence of corrections to acquire new skills very quickly. In our experiments, we show that this method can enable a policy to follow instructions and corrections for simulated navigation and manipulation tasks, substantially outperforming direct, non-interactive instruction following.\n",
      "Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.\n",
      "We present Memory Augmented Policy Optimization (MAPO), a simple and novel way to leverage a memory buffer of promising trajectories to reduce the variance of policy gradient estimate. MAPO is applicable to deterministic environments with discrete actions, such as structured prediction and combinatorial optimization tasks. We express the expected return objective as a weighted sum of two terms: an expectation over the high-reward trajectories inside the memory buffer, and a separate expectation over trajectories outside the buffer. To make an efficient algorithm of MAPO, we propose: (1) memory weight clipping to accelerate and stabilize training; (2) systematic exploration to discover high-reward trajectories; (3) distributed sampling from inside and outside of the memory buffer to scale up training. MAPO improves the sample efficiency and robustness of policy gradient, especially on tasks with sparse rewards. We evaluate MAPO on weakly supervised program synthesis from natural language (semantic parsing). On the WikiTableQuestions benchmark, we improve the state-of-the-art by 2.6%, achieving an accuracy of 46.3%. On the WikiSQL benchmark, MAPO achieves an accuracy of 74.9% with only weak supervision, outperforming several strong baselines with full supervision.

      "Existing methods for interactive image retrieval have demonstrated the merit of integrating user feedback, improving retrieval results. However, most current systems rely on restricted forms of user feedback, such as binary relevance responses, or feedback based on a fixed set of relative attributes, which limits their impact. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to interactive image search that enables users to provide feedback via natural language, allowing for more natural and effective interaction. We formulate the task of dialog-based interactive image retrieval as a reinforcement learning problem, and reward the dialog system for improving the rank of the target image during each dialog turn. To mitigate the cumbersome and costly process of collecting human-machine conversations as the dialog system learns, we train our system with a user simulator, which is itself trained to describe the differences between target and candidate images. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated in a footwear retrieval application. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that 1) our proposed learning framework achieves better accuracy than other supervised and reinforcement learning baselines and 2) user feedback based on natural language rather than pre-specified attributes leads to more effective retrieval results, and a more natural and expressive communication interface.\n",
      "Deep Neural networks are efficient and flexible models that perform well for a variety of tasks such as image, speech recognition and natural language understanding. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) generate a keen interest among researchers in computer vision and more specifically in classification tasks. CNN architecture and related hyperparameters are generally correlated to the nature of the processed task as the network extracts complex and relevant characteristics allowing the optimal convergence. Designing such architectures requires significant human expertise, substantial computation time and doesn't always lead to the optimal network. Model configuration topic has been extensively studied in machine learning without leading to a standard automatic method. This survey focuses on reviewing and discussing the current progress in automating CNN architecture search.\n",
      "There are two major approaches for sequence labeling. One is the probabilistic gradient-based methods such as conditional random fields (CRF) and neural networks (e.g., RNN), which have high accuracy but drawbacks: slow training, and no support of search-based optimization (which is important in many cases). The other is the search-based learning methods such as structured perceptron and margin infused relaxed algorithm (MIRA), which have fast training but also drawbacks: low accuracy, no probabilistic information, and non-convergence in real-world tasks. We propose a novel and \"easy\" solution, a search-based probabilistic online learning method, to address most of those issues. The method is \"easy\", because the optimization algorithm at the training stage is as simple as the decoding algorithm at the test stage. This method searches the output candidates, derives probabilities, and conducts efficient online learning. We show that this method with fast training and theoretical guarantee of convergence, which is easy to implement, can support search-based optimization and obtain top accuracy. Experiments on well-known tasks show that our method has better accuracy than CRF and BiLSTM\\footnote{The SAPO code is released at \\url{https://github.com/lancopku/SAPO}.}.\n",
      "While it has become common to perform automated translations on natural language, performing translations between different representations of mathematical formulae has thus far not been possible. We implemented the first translator for mathematical formulae based on recursive neural networks. We chose recursive neural networks because mathematical formulae inherently include a structural encoding. In our implementation, we developed new techniques and topologies for recursive tree-to-tree neural networks based on multi-variate multi-valued Long Short-Term Memory cells. We propose a novel approach for mini-batch training that utilizes clustering and tree traversal. We evaluate our translator and analyze the behavior of our proposed topologies and techniques based on a translation from generic LaTeX to the semantic LaTeX notation. We use the semantic LaTeX notation from the Digital Library for Mathematical Formulae and the Digital Repository for Mathematical Formulae at the National Institute for Standards and Technology. We find that a simple heuristics-based clustering algorithm outperforms the conventional clustering algorithms on the task of clustering binary trees of mathematical formulae with respect to their topology. Furthermore, we find a mask for the loss function, which can prevent the neural network from finding a local minimum of the loss function. Given our preliminary results, a complete translation from formula to formula is not yet possible. However, we achieved a prediction accuracy of 47.05% for predicting symbols at the correct position and an accuracy of 92.3% when ignoring the predicted position. Concluding, our work advances the field of recursive neural networks by improving the training speed and quality of training. In the future, we will work towards a complete translation allowing a machine-interpretation of LaTeX formulae.\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel method for the representation of images that is semantic by nature, addressing the question of computation intelligibility in computer vision tasks. More specifically, our proposition is to introduce what we call a semantic bottleneck in the processing pipeline, which is a crossing point in which the representation of the image is entirely expressed with natural language , while retaining the efficiency of numerical representations. We show that our approach is able to generate semantic representations that give state-of-the-art results on semantic content-based image retrieval and also perform very well on image classification tasks. Intelligibility is evaluated through user centered experiments for failure detection.\n",
      "MAC Net is a compositional attention network designed for Visual Question Answering. We propose a modified MAC net architecture for Natural Language Question Answering. Question Answering typically requires Language Understanding and multi-step Reasoning. MAC net's unique architecture - the separation between memory and control, facilitates data-driven iterative reasoning. This makes it an ideal candidate for solving tasks that involve logical reasoning. Our experiments with 20 bAbI tasks demonstrate the value of MAC net as a data-efficient and interpretable architecture for Natural Language Question Answering. The transparent nature of MAC net provides a highly granular view of the reasoning steps taken by the network in answering a query.\n",
      "Automatic generation of natural language from images has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, we take one step further to investigate generation of poetic language (with multiple lines) to an image for automatic poetry creation. This task involves multiple challenges, including discovering poetic clues from the image (e.g., hope from green), and generating poems to satisfy both relevance to the image and poeticness in language level. To solve the above challenges, we formulate the task of poem generation into two correlated sub-tasks by multi-adversarial training via policy gradient, through which the cross-modal relevance and poetic language style can be ensured. To extract poetic clues from images, we propose to learn a deep coupled visual-poetic embedding, in which the poetic representation from objects, sentiments and scenes in an image can be jointly learned. Two discriminative networks are further introduced to guide the poem generation, including a multi-modal discriminator and a poem-style discriminator. To facilitate the research, we have released two poem datasets by human annotators with two distinct properties: 1) the first human annotated image-to-poem pair dataset (with 8,292 pairs in total), and 2) to-date the largest public English poem corpus dataset (with 92,265 different poems in total). Extensive experiments are conducted with 8K images, among which 1.5K image are randomly picked for evaluation. Both objective and subjective evaluations show the superior performances against the state-of-the-art methods for poem generation from images. Turing test carried out with over 500 human subjects, among which 30 evaluators are poetry experts, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.\n",
      "Generic generation and manipulation of text is challenging and has limited success compared to recent deep generative modeling in visual domain. This paper aims at generating plausible natural language sentences, whose attributes are dynamically controlled by learning disentangled latent representations with designated semantics. We propose a new neural generative model which combines variational auto-encoders and holistic attribute discriminators for effective imposition of semantic structures. With differentiable approximation to discrete text samples, explicit constraints on independent attribute controls, and efficient collaborative learning of generator and discriminators, our model learns highly interpretable representations from even only word annotations, and produces realistic sentences with desired attributes. Quantitative evaluation validates the accuracy of sentence and attribute generation.\n",
      "We introduce MASSES, a simple evaluation metric for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA). In its standard form, the VQA task is operationalized as follows: Given an image and an open-ended question in natural language, systems are required to provide a suitable answer. Currently, model performance is evaluated by means of a somehow simplistic metric: If the predicted answer is chosen by at least 3 human annotators out of 10, then it is 100% correct. Though intuitively valuable, this metric has some important limitations. First, it ignores whether the predicted answer is the one selected by the Majority (MA) of annotators. Second, it does not account for the quantitative Subjectivity (S) of the answers in the sample (and dataset). Third, information about the Semantic Similarity (SES) of the responses is completely neglected. Based on such limitations, we propose a multi-component metric that accounts for all these issues. We show that our metric is effective in providing a more fine-grained evaluation both on the quantitative and qualitative level.\n",
      "Recurrent neural networks have become ubiquitous in computing representations of sequential data, especially textual data in natural language processing. In particular, Bidirectional LSTMs are at the heart of several neural models achieving state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of tasks in NLP. However, BiLSTMs are known to suffer from sequential bias - the contextual representation of a token is heavily influenced by tokens close to it in a sentence. We propose a general and effective improvement to the BiLSTM model which encodes each suffix and prefix of a sequence of tokens in both forward and reverse directions. We call our model Suffix Bidirectional LSTM or SuBiLSTM. This introduces an alternate bias that favors long range dependencies. We apply SuBiLSTMs to several tasks that require sentence modeling. We demonstrate that using SuBiLSTM instead of a BiLSTM in existing models leads to improvements in performance in learning general sentence representations, text classification, textual entailment and paraphrase detection. Using SuBiLSTM we achieve new state-of-the-art results for fine-grained sentiment classification and question classification.\n",
      "The task of conducting visually grounded dialog involves learning goal-oriented cooperative dialog between autonomous agents who exchange information about a scene through several rounds of questions and answers in natural language. We posit that requiring artificial agents to adhere to the rules of human language, while also requiring them to maximize information exchange through dialog is an ill-posed problem. We observe that humans do not stray from a common language because they are social creatures who live in communities, and have to communicate with many people everyday, so it is far easier to stick to a common language even at the cost of some efficiency loss. Using this as inspiration, we propose and evaluate a multi-agent community-based dialog framework where each agent interacts with, and learns from, multiple agents, and show that this community-enforced regularization results in more relevant and coherent dialog (as judged by human evaluators) without sacrificing task performance (as judged by quantitative metrics).\n",
      "Inducing sparseness while training neural networks has been shown to yield models with a lower memory footprint but similar effectiveness to dense models. However, sparseness is typically induced starting from a dense model, and thus this advantage does not hold during training. We propose techniques to enforce sparseness upfront in recurrent sequence models for NLP applications, to also benefit training. First, in language modeling, we show how to increase hidden state sizes in recurrent layers without increasing the number of parameters, leading to more expressive models. Second, for sequence labeling, we show that word embeddings with predefined sparseness lead to similar performance as dense embeddings, at a fraction of the number of trainable parameters.\n",
      "Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models designed to cause the model to make a mistake. They are useful for understanding the shortcomings of machine learning models, interpreting their results, and for regularisation. In NLP, however, most example generation strategies produce input text by using known, pre-specified semantic transformations, requiring significant manual effort and in-depth understanding of the problem and domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatically generating adversarial examples that violate a set of given First-Order Logic constraints in Natural Language Inference (NLI). We reduce the problem of identifying such adversarial examples to a combinatorial optimisation problem, by maximising a quantity measuring the degree of violation of such constraints and by using a language model for generating linguistically-plausible examples. Furthermore, we propose a method for adversarially regularising neural NLI models for incorporating background knowledge. Our results show that, while the proposed method does not always improve results on the SNLI and MultiNLI datasets, it significantly and consistently increases the predictive accuracy on adversarially-crafted datasets -- up to a 79.6% relative improvement -- while drastically reducing the number of background knowledge violations. Furthermore, we show that adversarial examples transfer among model architectures, and that the proposed adversarial training procedure improves the robustness of NLI models to adversarial examples.\n",
      "Computational modeling of human multimodal language is an emerging research area in natural language processing spanning the language, visual and acoustic modalities. Comprehending multimodal language requires modeling not only the interactions within each modality (intra-modal interactions) but more importantly the interactions between modalities (cross-modal interactions). In this paper, we propose the Recurrent Multistage Fusion Network (RMFN) which decomposes the fusion problem into multiple stages, each of them focused on a subset of multimodal signals for specialized, effective fusion. Cross-modal interactions are modeled using this multistage fusion approach which builds upon intermediate representations of previous stages. Temporal and intra-modal interactions are modeled by integrating our proposed fusion approach with a system of recurrent neural networks. The RMFN displays state-of-the-art performance in modeling human multimodal language across three public datasets relating to multimodal sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and speaker traits recognition. We provide visualizations to show that each stage of fusion focuses on a different subset of multimodal signals, learning increasingly discriminative multimodal representations.\n",
      "This paper examines to what degree current deep learning architectures for image caption generation capture spatial language. On the basis of the evaluation of examples of generated captions from the literature we argue that systems capture what objects are in the image data but not where these objects are located: the captions generated by these systems are the output of a language model conditioned on the output of an object detector that cannot capture fine-grained location information. Although language models provide useful knowledge for image captions, we argue that deep learning image captioning architectures should also model geometric relations between objects.\n",
      "Deep reinforcement learning has recently shown many impressive successes. However, one major obstacle towards applying such methods to real-world problems is their lack of data-efficiency. To this end, we propose the Bottleneck Simulator: a model-based reinforcement learning method which combines a learned, factorized transition model of the environment with rollout simulations to learn an effective policy from few examples. The learned transition model employs an abstract, discrete (bottleneck) state, which increases sample efficiency by reducing the number of model parameters and by exploiting structural properties of the environment. We provide a mathematical analysis of the Bottleneck Simulator in terms of fixed points of the learned policy, which reveals how performance is affected by four distinct sources of error: an error related to the abstract space structure, an error related to the transition model estimation variance, an error related to the transition model estimation bias, and an error related to the transition model class bias. Finally, we evaluate the Bottleneck Simulator on two natural language processing tasks: a text adventure game and a real-world, complex dialogue response selection task. On both tasks, the Bottleneck Simulator yields excellent performance beating competing approaches.\n",
      "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become increasingly popular in computer vision, natural language processing, and other areas. However, training and fine-tuning a deep learning model is computationally intensive and time-consuming. We propose a new method to improve the performance of nearly every model including pre-trained models. The proposed method uses an ensemble approach where the networks in the ensemble are constructed by reassigning model parameter values based on the probabilistic distribution of these parameters, calculated towards the end of the training process. For pre-trained models, this approach results in an additional training step (usually less than one epoch). We perform a variety of analysis using the MNIST dataset and validate the approach with a number of DNN models using pre-trained models on the ImageNet dataset.\n",
      "Conventional embedding methods directly associate each symbol with a continuous embedding vector, which is equivalent to applying a linear transformation based on a \"one-hot\" encoding of the discrete symbols. Despite its simplicity, such approach yields the number of parameters that grows linearly with the vocabulary size and can lead to overfitting. In this work, we propose a much more compact K-way D-dimensional discrete encoding scheme to replace the \"one-hot\" encoding. In the proposed \"KD encoding\", each symbol is represented by a $D$-dimensional code with a cardinality of $K$, and the final symbol embedding vector is generated by composing the code embedding vectors. To end-to-end learn semantically meaningful codes, we derive a relaxed discrete optimization approach based on stochastic gradient descent, which can be generally applied to any differentiable computational graph with an embedding layer. In our experiments with various applications from natural language processing to graph convolutional networks, the total size of the embedding layer can be reduced up to 98\\% while achieving similar or better performance.\n",
      "In this paper, we are interested in modeling complex activities that occur in a typical household. We propose to use programs, i.e., sequences of atomic actions and interactions, as a high level representation of complex tasks. Programs are interesting because they provide a non-ambiguous representation of a task, and allow agents to execute them. However, nowadays, there is no database providing this type of information. Towards this goal, we first crowd-source programs for a variety of activities that happen in people's homes, via a game-like interface used for teaching kids how to code. Using the collected dataset, we show how we can learn to extract programs directly from natural language descriptions or from videos. We then implement the most common atomic (inter)actions in the Unity3D game engine, and use our programs to \"drive\" an artificial agent to execute tasks in a simulated household environment. Our VirtualHome simulator allows us to create a large activity video dataset with rich ground-truth, enabling training and testing of video understanding models. We further showcase examples of our agent performing tasks in our VirtualHome based on language descriptions.\n",
      "Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a complex semantic task requiring both natural language processing and visual recognition. In this paper, we explore whether VQA is solvable when images are captured in a sub-Nyquist compressive paradigm. We develop a series of deep-network architectures that exploit available compressive data to increasing degrees of accuracy, and show that VQA is indeed solvable in the compressed domain. Our results show that there is nominal degradation in VQA performance when using compressive measurements, but that accuracy can be recovered when VQA pipelines are used in conjunction with state-of-the-art deep neural networks for CS reconstruction. The results presented yield important implications for resource-constrained VQA applications.\n",
      "Learning tasks on source code (i.e., formal languages) have been considered recently, but most work has tried to transfer natural language methods and does not capitalize on the unique opportunities offered by code's known syntax. For example, long-range dependencies induced by using the same variable or function in distant locations are often not considered. We propose to use graphs to represent both the syntactic and semantic structure of code and use graph-based deep learning methods to learn to reason over program structures.   In this work, we present how to construct graphs from source code and how to scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate our method on two tasks: VarNaming, in which a network attempts to predict the name of a variable given its usage, and VarMisuse, in which the network learns to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VarMisuse task in many cases. Additionally, our testing showed that VarMisuse identifies a number of bugs in mature open-source projects.\n",
      "A robot that can carry out a natural-language instruction has been a dream since before the Jetsons cartoon series imagined a life of leisure mediated by a fleet of attentive robot helpers. It is a dream that remains stubbornly distant. However, recent advances in vision and language methods have made incredible progress in closely related areas. This is significant because a robot interpreting a natural-language navigation instruction on the basis of what it sees is carrying out a vision and language process that is similar to Visual Question Answering. Both tasks can be interpreted as visually grounded sequence-to-sequence translation problems, and many of the same methods are applicable. To enable and encourage the application of vision and language methods to the problem of interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions, we present the Matterport3D Simulator -- a large-scale reinforcement learning environment based on real imagery. Using this simulator, which can in future support a range of embodied vision and language tasks, we provide the first benchmark dataset for visually-grounded natural language navigation in real buildings -- the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset.\n",
      "In this paper, we address referring expression comprehension: localizing an image region described by a natural language expression. While most recent work treats expressions as a single unit, we propose to decompose them into three modular components related to subject appearance, location, and relationship to other objects. This allows us to flexibly adapt to expressions containing different types of information in an end-to-end framework. In our model, which we call the Modular Attention Network (MAttNet), two types of attention are utilized: language-based attention that learns the module weights as well as the word/phrase attention that each module should focus on; and visual attention that allows the subject and relationship modules to focus on relevant image components. Module weights combine scores from all three modules dynamically to output an overall score. Experiments show that MAttNet outperforms previous state-of-art methods by a large margin on both bounding-box-level and pixel-level comprehension tasks. Demo and code are provided.\n",
      "We present a method for generating colored 3D shapes from natural language. To this end, we first learn joint embeddings of freeform text descriptions and colored 3D shapes. Our model combines and extends learning by association and metric learning approaches to learn implicit cross-modal connections, and produces a joint representation that captures the many-to-many relations between language and physical properties of 3D shapes such as color and shape. To evaluate our approach, we collect a large dataset of natural language descriptions for physical 3D objects in the ShapeNet dataset. With this learned joint embedding we demonstrate text-to-shape retrieval that outperforms baseline approaches. Using our embeddings with a novel conditional Wasserstein GAN framework, we generate colored 3D shapes from text. Our method is the first to connect natural language text with realistic 3D objects exhibiting rich variations in color, texture, and shape detail. See video at https://youtu.be/zraPvRdl13Q\n",
      "To perform tasks specified by natural language instructions, autonomous agents need to extract semantically meaningful representations of language and map it to visual elements and actions in the environment. This problem is called task-oriented language grounding. We propose an end-to-end trainable neural architecture for task-oriented language grounding in 3D environments which assumes no prior linguistic or perceptual knowledge and requires only raw pixels from the environment and the natural language instruction as input. The proposed model combines the image and text representations using a Gated-Attention mechanism and learns a policy to execute the natural language instruction using standard reinforcement and imitation learning methods. We show the effectiveness of the proposed model on unseen instructions as well as unseen maps, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also introduce a novel environment based on a 3D game engine to simulate the challenges of task-oriented language grounding over a rich set of instructions and environment states.\n",
      "Recent systems on structured prediction focus on increasing the level of structural dependencies within the model. However, our study suggests that complex structures entail high overfitting risks. To control the structure-based overfitting, we propose to conduct structure regularization decoding (SR decoding). The decoding of the complex structure model is regularized by the additionally trained simple structure model. We theoretically analyze the quantitative relations between the structural complexity and the overfitting risk. The analysis shows that complex structure models are prone to the structure-based overfitting. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed method improves the performance of the complex structure models by reducing the structure-based overfitting. On the sequence labeling tasks, the proposed method substantially improves the performance of the complex neural network models. The maximum F1 error rate reduction is 36.4% for the third-order model. The proposed method also works for the parsing task. The maximum UAS improvement is 5.5% for the tri-sibling model. The results are competitive with or better than the state-of-the-art results.\n",
      "A fundamental challenge in developing high-impact machine learning technologies is balancing the need to model rich, structured domains with the ability to scale to big data. Many important problem areas are both richly structured and large scale, from social and biological networks, to knowledge graphs and the Web, to images, video, and natural language. In this paper, we introduce two new formalisms for modeling structured data, and show that they can both capture rich structure and scale to big data. The first, hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), is a new kind of probabilistic graphical model that generalizes different approaches to convex inference. We unite three approaches from the randomized algorithms, probabilistic graphical models, and fuzzy logic communities, showing that all three lead to the same inference objective. We then define HL-MRFs by generalizing this unified objective. The second new formalism, probabilistic soft logic (PSL), is a probabilistic programming language that makes HL-MRFs easy to define using a syntax based on first-order logic. We introduce an algorithm for inferring most-probable variable assignments (MAP inference) that is much more scalable than general-purpose convex optimization methods, because it uses message passing to take advantage of sparse dependency structures. We then show how to learn the parameters of HL-MRFs. The learned HL-MRFs are as accurate as analogous discrete models, but much more scalable. Together, these algorithms enable HL-MRFs and PSL to model rich, structured data at scales not previously possible.\n",
      "Automatic generation of caption to describe the content of an image has been gaining a lot of research interests recently, where most of the existing works treat the image caption as pure sequential data. Natural language, however possess a temporal hierarchy structure, with complex dependencies between each subsequence. In this paper, we propose a phrase-based hierarchical Long Short-Term Memory (phi-LSTM) model to generate image description. In contrast to the conventional solutions that generate caption in a pure sequential manner, our proposed model decodes image caption from phrase to sentence. It consists of a phrase decoder at the bottom hierarchy to decode noun phrases of variable length, and an abbreviated sentence decoder at the upper hierarchy to decode an abbreviated form of the image description. A complete image caption is formed by combining the generated phrases with sentence during the inference stage. Empirically, our proposed model shows a better or competitive result on the Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets in comparison to the state-of-the art models. We also show that our proposed model is able to generate more novel captions (not seen in the training data) which are richer in word contents in all these three datasets.\n",
      "We present a novel and scalable label embedding framework for large-scale multi-label learning a.k.a ExMLDS (Extreme Multi-Label Learning using Distributional Semantics). Our approach draws inspiration from ideas rooted in distributional semantics, specifically the Skip Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) approach, widely used to learn word embeddings for natural language processing tasks. Learning such embeddings can be reduced to a certain matrix factorization. Our approach is novel in that it highlights interesting connections between label embedding methods used for multi-label learning and paragraph/document embedding methods commonly used for learning representations of text data. The framework can also be easily extended to incorporate auxiliary information such as label-label correlations; this is crucial especially when there are a lot of missing labels in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive set of experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets, and show that the proposed learning methods perform favorably compared to several baselines and state-of-the-art methods for large-scale multi-label learning. To facilitate end-to-end learning, we develop a joint learning algorithm that can learn the embeddings as well as a regression model that predicts these embeddings given input features, via efficient gradient-based methods.\n",
      "Graph-structured data appears frequently in domains including chemistry, natural language semantics, social networks, and knowledge bases. In this work, we study feature learning techniques for graph-structured inputs. Our starting point is previous work on Graph Neural Networks (Scarselli et al., 2009), which we modify to use gated recurrent units and modern optimization techniques and then extend to output sequences. The result is a flexible and broadly useful class of neural network models that has favorable inductive biases relative to purely sequence-based models (e.g., LSTMs) when the problem is graph-structured. We demonstrate the capabilities on some simple AI (bAbI) and graph algorithm learning tasks. We then show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on a problem from program verification, in which subgraphs need to be matched to abstract data structures.\n",
      "When encountering novel objects, humans are able to infer a wide range of physical properties such as mass, friction and deformability by interacting with them in a goal driven way. This process of active interaction is in the same spirit as a scientist performing experiments to discover hidden facts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that state of art deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.\n",
      "In this paper we present a new dataset and user simulator e-QRAQ (explainable Query, Reason, and Answer Question) which tests an Agent's ability to read an ambiguous text; ask questions until it can answer a challenge question; and explain the reasoning behind its questions and answer. The User simulator provides the Agent with a short, ambiguous story and a challenge question about the story. The story is ambiguous because some of the entities have been replaced by variables. At each turn the Agent may ask for the value of a variable or try to answer the challenge question. In response the User simulator provides a natural language explanation of why the Agent's query or answer was useful in narrowing down the set of possible answers, or not. To demonstrate one potential application of the e-QRAQ dataset, we train a new neural architecture based on End-to-End Memory Networks to successfully generate both predictions and partial explanations of its current understanding of the problem. We observe a strong correlation between the quality of the prediction and explanation.\n",
      "Deep models are the defacto standard in visual decision models due to their impressive performance on a wide array of visual tasks. However, they are frequently seen as opaque and are unable to explain their decisions. In contrast, humans can justify their decisions with natural language and point to the evidence in the visual world which led to their decisions. We postulate that deep models can do this as well and propose our Pointing and Justification (PJ-X) model which can justify its decision with a sentence and point to the evidence by introspecting its decision and explanation process using an attention mechanism. Unfortunately there is no dataset available with reference explanations for visual decision making. We thus collect two datasets in two domains where it is interesting and challenging to explain decisions. First, we extend the visual question answering task to not only provide an answer but also a natural language explanation for the answer. Second, we focus on explaining human activities which is traditionally more challenging than object classification. We extensively evaluate our PJ-X model, both on the justification and pointing tasks, by comparing it to prior models and ablations using both automatic and human evaluations.\n",
      "Building neural networks to query a knowledge base (a table) with natural language is an emerging research topic in deep learning. An executor for table querying typically requires multiple steps of execution because queries may have complicated structures. In previous studies, researchers have developed either fully distributed executors or symbolic executors for table querying. A distributed executor can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, but is weak in terms of execution efficiency and explicit interpretability. A symbolic executor is efficient in execution, but is very difficult to train especially at initial stages. In this paper, we propose to couple distributed and symbolic execution for natural language queries, where the symbolic executor is pretrained with the distributed executor's intermediate execution results in a step-by-step fashion. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms both distributed and symbolic executors, exhibiting high accuracy, high learning efficiency, high execution efficiency, and high interpretability.\n",

      "Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a recent problem in computer vision and natural language processing that has garnered a large amount of interest from the deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing communities. In VQA, an algorithm needs to answer text-based questions about images. Since the release of the first VQA dataset in 2014, additional datasets have been released and many algorithms have been proposed. In this review, we critically examine the current state of VQA in terms of problem formulation, existing datasets, evaluation metrics, and algorithms. In particular, we discuss the limitations of current datasets with regard to their ability to properly train and assess VQA algorithms. We then exhaustively review existing algorithms for VQA. Finally, we discuss possible future directions for VQA and image understanding research.\n",
      "Referring expressions are natural language constructions used to identify particular objects within a scene. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for the tasks of referring expression comprehension and generation. Our model is composed of three modules: speaker, listener, and reinforcer. The speaker generates referring expressions, the listener comprehends referring expressions, and the reinforcer introduces a reward function to guide sampling of more discriminative expressions. The listener-speaker modules are trained jointly in an end-to-end learning framework, allowing the modules to be aware of one another during learning while also benefiting from the discriminative reinforcer's feedback. We demonstrate that this unified framework and training achieves state-of-the-art results for both comprehension and generation on three referring expression datasets.

      "Image captioning is a challenging problem owing to the complexity in understanding the image content and diverse ways of describing it in natural language. Recent advances in deep neural networks have substantially improved the performance of this task. Most state-of-the-art approaches follow an encoder-decoder framework, which generates captions using a sequential recurrent prediction model. However, in this paper, we introduce a novel decision-making framework for image captioning. We utilize a \"policy network\" and a \"value network\" to collaboratively generate captions. The policy network serves as a local guidance by providing the confidence of predicting the next word according to the current state. Additionally, the value network serves as a global and lookahead guidance by evaluating all possible extensions of the current state. In essence, it adjusts the goal of predicting the correct words towards the goal of generating captions similar to the ground truth captions. We train both networks using an actor-critic reinforcement learning model, with a novel reward defined by visual-semantic embedding. Extensive experiments and analyses on the Microsoft COCO dataset show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across different evaluation metrics.\n",
      "We introduce the first goal-driven training for visual question answering and dialog agents. Specifically, we pose a cooperative 'image guessing' game between two agents -- Qbot and Abot -- who communicate in natural language dialog so that Qbot can select an unseen image from a lineup of images. We use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end -- from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.   We demonstrate two experimental results.   First, as a 'sanity check' demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show results on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded vocabulary, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style). Thus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among 'visual' dialog agents with no human supervision.   Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset, where we pretrain with supervised dialog data and show that the RL 'fine-tuned' agents significantly outperform SL agents. Interestingly, the RL Qbot learns to ask questions that Abot is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative dialog and a better team.\n",
      "Many Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are item-based in the sense that they analyze item-item relations in order to produce item similarities. Recently, several works in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggested to learn a latent representation of words using neural embedding algorithms. Among them, the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS), also known as word2vec, was shown to provide state-of-the-art results on various linguistics tasks. In this paper, we show that item-based CF can be cast in the same framework of neural word embedding. Inspired by SGNS, we describe a method we name item2vec for item-based CF that produces embedding for items in a latent space. The method is capable of inferring item-item relations even when user information is not available. We present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the item2vec method and show it is competitive with SVD.\n",
      "Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding. Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.\n",
      "We propose a scalable approach to learn video-based question answering (QA): answer a \"free-form natural language question\" about a video content. Our approach automatically harvests a large number of videos and descriptions freely available online. Then, a large number of candidate QA pairs are automatically generated from descriptions rather than manually annotated. Next, we use these candidate QA pairs to train a number of video-based QA methods extended fromMN (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015), VQA (Antol et al. 2015), SA (Yao et al. 2015), SS (Venugopalan et al. 2015). In order to handle non-perfect candidate QA pairs, we propose a self-paced learning procedure to iteratively identify them and mitigate their effects in training. Finally, we evaluate performance on manually generated video-based QA pairs. The results show that our self-paced learning procedure is effective, and the extended SS model outperforms various baselines.\n",
      "We address a question answering task on real-world images that is set up as a Visual Turing Test. By combining latest advances in image representation and natural language processing, we propose Ask Your Neurons, a scalable, jointly trained, end-to-end formulation to this problem.   In contrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where the language output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language inputs (image and question). We provide additional insights into the problem by analyzing how much information is contained only in the language part for which we provide a new human baseline. To study human consensus, which is related to the ambiguities inherent in this challenging task, we propose two novel metrics and collect additional answers which extend the original DAQUAR dataset to DAQUAR-Consensus.   Moreover, we also extend our analysis to VQA, a large-scale question answering about images dataset, where we investigate some particular design choices and show the importance of stronger visual models. At the same time, we achieve strong performance of our model that still uses a global image representation. Finally, based on such analysis, we refine our Ask Your Neurons on DAQUAR, which also leads to a better performance on this challenging task.\n",
      "Together with the development of more accurate methods in Computer Vision and Natural Language Understanding, holistic architectures that answer on questions about the content of real-world images have emerged. In this tutorial, we build a neural-based approach to answer questions about images. We base our tutorial on two datasets: (mostly on) DAQUAR, and (a bit on) VQA. With small tweaks the models that we present here can achieve a competitive performance on both datasets, in fact, they are among the best methods that use a combination of LSTM with a global, full frame CNN representation of an image. We hope that after reading this tutorial, the reader will be able to use Deep Learning frameworks, such as Keras and introduced Kraino, to build various architectures that will lead to a further performance improvement on this challenging task.\n",
      "Recurrent neural networks have recently been used for learning to describe images using natural language. However, it has been observed that these models generalize poorly to scenes that were not observed during training, possibly depending too strongly on the statistics of the text in the training data. Here we propose to describe images using short structured representations, aiming to capture the crux of a description. These structured representations allow us to tease-out and evaluate separately two types of generalization: standard generalization to new images with similar scenes, and generalization to new combinations of known entities. We compare two learning approaches on the MS-COCO dataset: a state-of-the-art recurrent network based on an LSTM (Show, Attend and Tell), and a simple structured prediction model on top of a deep network. We find that the structured model generalizes to new compositions substantially better than the LSTM, ~7 times the accuracy of predicting structured representations. By providing a concrete method to quantify generalization for unseen combinations, we argue that structured representations and compositional splits are a useful benchmark for image captioning, and advocate compositional models that capture linguistic and visual structure.\n",
      "Traditional graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, even though widely applied, are not suited for massive data and large label scenarios since they scale linearly with the number of edges $|E|$ and distinct labels $m$. To deal with the large label size problem, recent works propose sketch-based methods to approximate the distribution on labels per node thereby achieving a space reduction from $O(m)$ to $O(\\log m)$, under certain conditions. In this paper, we present a novel streaming graph-based SSL approximation that captures the sparsity of the label distribution and ensures the algorithm propagates labels accurately, and further reduces the space complexity per node to $O(1)$. We also provide a distributed version of the algorithm that scales well to large data sizes. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the new method achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art algorithms with significant reduction in memory footprint. We also study different graph construction mechanisms for natural language applications and propose a robust graph augmentation strategy trained using state-of-the-art unsupervised deep learning architectures that yields further significant quality gains.\n",
      "Learning the true ordering between objects by aggregating a set of expert opinion rank order lists is an important and ubiquitous problem in many applications ranging from social choice theory to natural language processing and search aggregation. We study the problem of unsupervised rank aggregation where no ground truth ordering information in available, neither about the true preference ordering between any set of objects nor about the quality of individual rank lists. Aggregating the often inconsistent and poor quality rank lists in such an unsupervised manner is a highly challenging problem, and standard consensus-based methods are often ill-defined, and difficult to solve. In this manuscript we propose a novel framework to bypass these issues by using object attributes to augment the standard rank aggregation framework. We design algorithms that learn joint models on both rank lists and object features to obtain an aggregated rank ordering that is more accurate and robust, and also helps weed out rank lists of dubious validity. We validate our techniques on synthetic datasets where our algorithm is able to estimate the true rank ordering even when the rank lists are corrupted. Experiments on three real datasets, MQ2008, MQ2008 and OHSUMED, show that using object features can result in significant improvement in performance over existing rank aggregation methods that do not use object information. Furthermore, when at least some of the rank lists are of high quality, our methods are able to effectively exploit their high expertise to output an aggregated rank ordering of great accuracy.\n",
      "Structured prediction is used in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing to predict structured outputs such as segmentations or parse trees. In these settings, prediction is performed by MAP inference or, equivalently, by solving an integer linear program. Because of the complex scoring functions required to obtain accurate predictions, both learning and inference typically require the use of approximate solvers. We propose a theoretical explanation to the striking observation that approximations based on linear programming (LP) relaxations are often tight on real-world instances. In particular, we show that learning with LP relaxed inference encourages integrality of training instances, and that tightness generalizes from train to test data.\n",
      "Learning from multiple-relational data which contains noise, ambiguities, or duplicate entities is essential to a wide range of applications such as statistical inference based on Web Linked Data, recommender systems, computational biology, and natural language processing. These tasks usually require working with very large and complex datasets - e.g., the Web graph - however, current approaches to multi-relational learning are not practical for such scenarios due to their high computational complexity and poor scalability on large data.   In this paper, we propose a novel and scalable approach for multi-relational factorization based on consensus optimization. Our model, called ConsMRF, is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, which enables us to optimize each target relation using a smaller set of parameters than the state-of-the-art competitors in this task.   Due to ADMM's nature, ConsMRF can be easily parallelized which makes it suitable for large multi-relational data. Experiments on large Web datasets - derived from DBpedia, Wikipedia and YAGO - show the efficiency and performance improvement of ConsMRF over strong competitors. In addition, ConsMRF near-linear scalability indicates great potential to tackle Web-scale problem sizes.\n",
      "Understanding language goes hand in hand with the ability to integrate complex contextual information obtained via perception. In this work, we present a novel task for grounded language understanding: disambiguating a sentence given a visual scene which depicts one of the possible interpretations of that sentence. To this end, we introduce a new multimodal corpus containing ambiguous sentences, representing a wide range of syntactic, semantic and discourse ambiguities, coupled with videos that visualize the different interpretations for each sentence. We address this task by extending a vision model which determines if a sentence is depicted by a video. We demonstrate how such a model can be adjusted to recognize different interpretations of the same underlying sentence, allowing to disambiguate sentences in a unified fashion across the different ambiguity types.\n",
      "This paper presents a restricted visual Turing test (VTT) for story-line based deep understanding in long-term and multi-camera captured videos. Given a set of videos of a scene (such as a multi-room office, a garden, and a parking lot.) and a sequence of story-line based queries, the task is to provide answers either simply in binary form \"true/false\" (to a polar query) or in an accurate natural language description (to a non-polar query). Queries, polar or non-polar, consist of view-based queries which can be answered from a particular camera view and scene-centered queries which involves joint inference across different cameras. The story lines are collected to cover spatial, temporal and causal understanding of input videos. The data and queries distinguish our VTT from recently proposed visual question answering in images and video captioning. A vision system is proposed to perform joint video and query parsing which integrates different vision modules, a knowledge base and a query engine. The system provides unified interfaces for different modules so that individual modules can be reconfigured to test a new method. We provide a benchmark dataset and a toolkit for ontology guided story-line query generation which consists of about 93.5 hours videos captured in four different locations and 3,426 queries split into 127 story lines. We also provide a baseline implementation and result analyses.\n",
      "In this paper we propose the construction of linguistic descriptions of images. This is achieved through the extraction of scene description graphs (SDGs) from visual scenes using an automatically constructed knowledge base. SDGs are constructed using both vision and reasoning. Specifically, commonsense reasoning is applied on (a) detections obtained from existing perception methods on given images, (b) a \"commonsense\" knowledge base constructed using natural language processing of image annotations and (c) lexical ontological knowledge from resources such as WordNet. Amazon Mechanical Turk(AMT)-based evaluations on Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets show that in most cases, sentences auto-constructed from SDGs obtained by our method give a more relevant and thorough description of an image than a recent state-of-the-art image caption based approach. Our Image-Sentence Alignment Evaluation results are also comparable to that of the recent state-of-the art approaches.\n",
      "We address a question answering task on real-world images that is set up as a Visual Turing Test. By combining latest advances in image representation and natural language processing, we propose Neural-Image-QA, an end-to-end formulation to this problem for which all parts are trained jointly. In contrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where the language output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language input (image and question). Our approach Neural-Image-QA doubles the performance of the previous best approach on this problem. We provide additional insights into the problem by analyzing how much information is contained only in the language part for which we provide a new human baseline. To study human consensus, which is related to the ambiguities inherent in this challenging task, we propose two novel metrics and collect additional answers which extends the original DAQUAR dataset to DAQUAR-Consensus.\n",
      "Recent progress in using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for image description has motivated the exploration of their application for video description. However, while images are static, working with videos requires modeling their dynamic temporal structure and then properly integrating that information into a natural language description. In this context, we propose an approach that successfully takes into account both the local and global temporal structure of videos to produce descriptions. First, our approach incorporates a spatial temporal 3-D convolutional neural network (3-D CNN) representation of the short temporal dynamics. The 3-D CNN representation is trained on video action recognition tasks, so as to produce a representation that is tuned to human motion and behavior. Second we propose a temporal attention mechanism that allows to go beyond local temporal modeling and learns to automatically select the most relevant temporal segments given the text-generating RNN. Our approach exceeds the current state-of-art for both BLEU and METEOR metrics on the Youtube2Text dataset. We also present results on a new, larger and more challenging dataset of paired video and natural language descriptions.\n",
      "In this work, we introduce a dataset of video annotated with high quality natural language phrases describing the visual content in a given segment of time. Our dataset is based on the Descriptive Video Service (DVS) that is now encoded on many digital media products such as DVDs. DVS is an audio narration describing the visual elements and actions in a movie for the visually impaired. It is temporally aligned with the movie and mixed with the original movie soundtrack. We describe an automatic DVS segmentation and alignment method for movies, that enables us to scale up the collection of a DVS-derived dataset with minimal human intervention. Using this method, we have collected the largest DVS-derived dataset for video description of which we are aware. Our dataset currently includes over 84.6 hours of paired video/sentences from 92 DVDs and is growing.\n",
      "While computer and communication technologies have provided effective means to scale up many aspects of education, the submission and grading of assessments such as homework assignments and tests remains a weak link. In this paper, we study the problem of automatically grading the kinds of open response mathematical questions that figure prominently in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses. Our data-driven framework for mathematical language processing (MLP) leverages solution data from a large number of learners to evaluate the correctness of their solutions, assign partial-credit scores, and provide feedback to each learner on the likely locations of any errors. MLP takes inspiration from the success of natural language processing for text data and comprises three main steps. First, we convert each solution to an open response mathematical question into a series of numerical features. Second, we cluster the features from several solutions to uncover the structures of correct, partially correct, and incorrect solutions. We develop two different clustering approaches, one that leverages generic clustering algorithms and one based on Bayesian nonparametrics. Third, we automatically grade the remaining (potentially large number of) solutions based on their assigned cluster and one instructor-provided grade per cluster. As a bonus, we can track the cluster assignment of each step of a multistep solution and determine when it departs from a cluster of correct solutions, which enables us to indicate the likely locations of errors to learners. We test and validate MLP on real-world MOOC data to demonstrate how it can substantially reduce the human effort required in large-scale educational platforms.\n",
      "To cope with the high level of ambiguity faced in domains such as Computer Vision or Natural Language processing, robust prediction methods often search for a diverse set of high-quality candidate solutions or proposals. In structured prediction problems, this becomes a daunting task, as the solution space (image labelings, sentence parses, etc.) is exponentially large. We study greedy algorithms for finding a diverse subset of solutions in structured-output spaces by drawing new connections between submodular functions over combinatorial item sets and High-Order Potentials (HOPs) studied for graphical models. Specifically, we show via examples that when marginal gains of submodular diversity functions allow structured representations, this enables efficient (sub-linear time) approximate maximization by reducing the greedy augmentation step to inference in a factor graph with appropriately constructed HOPs. We discuss benefits, tradeoffs, and show that our constructions lead to significantly better proposals.\n",
      "For the last ten years, CAPTCHAs have been widely used by websites to prevent their data being automatically updated by machines. By supposedly allowing only humans to do so, CAPTCHAs take advantage of the reverse Turing test (TT), knowing that humans are more intelligent than machines. Generally, CAPTCHAs have defeated machines, but things are changing rapidly as technology improves. Hence, advanced research into optical character recognition (OCR) is overtaking attempts to strengthen CAPTCHAs against machine-based attacks. This paper investigates the immunity of CAPTCHA, which was built on the failure of the TT. We show that some CAPTCHAs are easily broken using a simple OCR machine built for the purpose of this study. By reviewing other techniques, we show that even more difficult CAPTCHAs can be broken using advanced OCR machines. Current advances in OCR should enable machines to pass the TT in the image recognition domain, which is exactly where machines are seeking to overcome CAPTCHAs. We enhance traditional CAPTCHAs by employing not only characters, but also natural language and multiple objects within the same CAPTCHA. The proposed CAPTCHAs might be able to hold out against machines, at least until the advent of a machine that passes the TT completely.\n",
      "Belief Propagation has been widely used for marginal inference, however it is slow on problems with large-domain variables and high-order factors. Previous work provides useful approximations to facilitate inference on such models, but lacks important anytime properties such as: 1) providing accurate and consistent marginals when stopped early, 2) improving the approximation when run longer, and 3) converging to the fixed point of BP. To this end, we propose a message passing algorithm that works on sparse (partially instantiated) domains, and converges to consistent marginals using dynamic message scheduling. The algorithm grows the sparse domains incrementally, selecting the next value to add using prioritization schemes based on the gradients of the marginal inference objective. Our experiments demonstrate local anytime consistency and fast convergence, providing significant speedups over BP to obtain low-error marginals: up to 25 times on grid models, and up to 6 times on a real-world natural language processing task.\n",
      "This paper deals with a scene recognition system in a robotics contex. The general problem is to match images with <I>a priori</I> descriptions. A typical mission would consist in identifying an object in an installation with a vision system situated at the end of a manipulator and with a human operator provided description, formulated in a pseudo-natural language, and possibly redundant. The originality of this work comes from the nature of the description, from the special attention given to the management of imprecision and uncertainty in the interpretation process and from the way to assess the description redundancy so as to reinforce the overall matching likelihood.\n",
      "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are one of the most fundamental and widely used statistical tools for modeling discrete time series. In general, learning HMMs from data is computationally hard (under cryptographic assumptions), and practitioners typically resort to search heuristics which suffer from the usual local optima issues. We prove that under a natural separation condition (bounds on the smallest singular value of the HMM parameters), there is an efficient and provably correct algorithm for learning HMMs. The sample complexity of the algorithm does not explicitly depend on the number of distinct (discrete) observations---it implicitly depends on this quantity through spectral properties of the underlying HMM. This makes the algorithm particularly applicable to settings with a large number of observations, such as those in natural language processing where the space of observation is sometimes the words in a language. The algorithm is also simple, employing only a singular value decomposition and matrix multiplications.\n",
      "We first present our work in machine translation, during which we used aligned sentences to train a neural network to embed n-grams of different languages into an $d$-dimensional space, such that n-grams that are the translation of each other are close with respect to some metric. Good n-grams to n-grams translation results were achieved, but full sentences translation is still problematic. We realized that learning semantics of sentences and documents was the key for solving a lot of natural language processing problems, and thus moved to the second part of our work: sentence compression. We introduce a flexible neural network architecture for learning embeddings of words and sentences that extract their semantics, propose an efficient implementation in the Torch framework and present embedding results comparable to the ones obtained with classical neural language models, while being more powerful.\n",
      "Current GNN-oriented NAS methods focus on the search for different layer aggregate components with shallow and simple architectures, which are limited by the 'over-smooth' problem. To further explore the benefits from structural diversity and depth of GNN architectures, we propose a GNN generation pipeline with a novel two-stage search space, which aims at automatically generating high-performance while transferable deep GNN models in a block-wise manner. Meanwhile, to alleviate the 'over-smooth' problem, we incorporate multiple flexible residual connection in our search space and apply identity mapping in the basic GNN layers. For the search algorithm, we use deep-q-learning with epsilon-greedy exploration strategy and reward reshaping. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our generated GNN models outperforms existing manually designed and NAS-based ones.\n",
      "For semantic segmentation of remote sensing images (RSI), trade-off between representation power and location accuracy is quite important. How to get the trade-off effectively is an open question, where current approaches of utilizing attention schemes or very deep models result in complex models with large memory consumption. Compared with the popularly-used convolutional neural network (CNN) with fixed square kernels, graph convolutional network (GCN) can explicitly utilize correlations between adjacent land covers and conduct flexible convolution on arbitrarily irregular image regions. However, the problems of large variations of target scales and blurred boundary cannot be easily solved by GCN, while densely connected atrous convolution network (DenseAtrousCNet) with multi-scale atrous convolution can expand the receptive fields and obtain image global information. Inspired by the advantages of both GCN and Atrous CNN, a two-stream deep neural network for semantic segmentation of RSI (RSI-Net) is proposed in this paper to obtain improved performance through modeling and propagating spatial contextual structure effectively and a novel decoding scheme with image-level and graph-level combination. Extensive experiments are implemented on the Vaihingen, Potsdam and Gaofen RSI datasets, where the comparison results demonstrate the superior performance of RSI-Net in terms of overall accuracy, F1 score and kappa coefficient when compared with six state-of-the-art RSI semantic segmentation methods.\n",
      "Knowledge graph completion is the task of inferring missing facts based on existing data in a knowledge graph. Temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) is an extension of this task to temporal knowledge graphs, where each fact is additionally associated with a time stamp. Current approaches for TKGC primarily build on existing embedding models which are developed for (static) knowledge graph completion, and extend these models to incorporate time, where the idea is to learn latent representations for entities, relations, and timestamps and then use the learned representations to predict missing facts at various time steps. In this paper, we propose BoxTE, a box embedding model for TKGC, building on the static knowledge graph embedding model BoxE. We show that BoxTE is fully expressive, and possesses strong inductive capacity in the temporal setting. We then empirically evaluate our model and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on several TKGC benchmarks.\n",
      "Future manufacturing requires complex systems that connect simulation platforms and virtualization with physical data from industrial processes. Digital twins incorporate a physical twin, a digital twin, and the connection between the two. Benefits of using digital twins, especially in manufacturing, are abundant as they can increase efficiency across an entire manufacturing life-cycle. The digital twin concept has become increasingly sophisticated and capable over time, enabled by rises in many technologies. In this paper, we detail the cognitive digital twin as the next stage of advancement of a digital twin that will help realize the vision of Industry 4.0. Cognitive digital twins will allow enterprises to creatively, effectively, and efficiently exploit implicit knowledge drawn from the experience of existing manufacturing systems. They also enable more autonomous decisions and control, while improving the performance across the enterprise (at scale). This paper presents graph learning as one potential pathway towards enabling cognitive functionalities in manufacturing digital twins. A novel approach to realize cognitive digital twins in the product design stage of manufacturing that utilizes graph learning is presented.\n",
      "Trajectory prediction of vehicles in city-scale road networks is of great importance to various location-based applications such as vehicle navigation, traffic management, and location-based recommendations. Existing methods typically represent a trajectory as a sequence of grid cells, road segments or intention sets. None of them is ideal, as the cell-based representation ignores the road network structures and the other two are less efficient in analyzing city-scale road networks. Moreover, previous models barely leverage spatial dependencies or only consider them at the grid cell level, ignoring the non-Euclidean spatial structure shaped by irregular road networks. To address these problems, we propose a network-based vehicle trajectory prediction model named NetTraj, which represents each trajectory as a sequence of intersections and associated movement directions, and then feeds them into a LSTM encoder-decoder network for future trajectory generation. Furthermore, we introduce a local graph attention mechanism to capture network-level spatial dependencies of trajectories, and a temporal attention mechanism with a sliding context window to capture both short- and long-term temporal dependencies in trajectory data. Extensive experiments based on two real-world large-scale taxi trajectory datasets show that NetTraj outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for vehicle trajectory prediction, validating the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory representation method and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms.\n",
      "Missing data is an inevitable and ubiquitous problem for traffic data collection in intelligent transportation systems. Despite extensive research regarding traffic data imputation, there still exist two limitations to be addressed: first, existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic data, especially the dynamic spatial dependencies evolving with time; second, prior studies mainly focus on randomly missing patterns while other more complex missing scenarios are less discussed. To fill these research gaps, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Dynamic Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DSTGCN) to impute missing traffic data. The model combines the recurrent architecture with graph-based convolutions to model the spatiotemporal dependencies. Moreover, we introduce a graph structure estimation technique to model the dynamic spatial dependencies from real-time traffic information and road network structure. Extensive experiments based on two public traffic speed datasets are conducted to compare our proposed model with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in four types of missing patterns. The results show that our proposed model outperforms existing deep learning models in all kinds of missing scenarios and the graph structure estimation technique contributes to the model performance. We further compare our proposed model with a tensor factorization model and find distinct behaviors across different model families under different training schemes and data availability.\n",
      "We consider a novel data driven approach for designing learning algorithms that can effectively learn with only a small number of labeled examples. This is crucial for modern machine learning applications where labels are scarce or expensive to obtain. We focus on graph-based techniques, where the unlabeled examples are connected in a graph under the implicit assumption that similar nodes likely have similar labels. Over the past decades, several elegant graph-based semi-supervised and active learning algorithms for how to infer the labels of the unlabeled examples given the graph and a few labeled examples have been proposed. However, the problem of how to create the graph (which impacts the practical usefulness of these methods significantly) has been relegated to domain-specific art and heuristics and no general principles have been proposed. In this work we present a novel data driven approach for learning the graph and provide strong formal guarantees in both the distributional and online learning formalizations.   We show how to leverage problem instances coming from an underlying problem domain to learn the graph hyperparameters from commonly used parametric families of graphs that perform well on new instances coming from the same domain. We obtain low regret and efficient algorithms in the online setting, and generalization guarantees in the distributional setting. We also show how to combine several very different similarity metrics and learn multiple hyperparameters, providing general techniques to apply to large classes of problems. We expect some of the tools and techniques we develop along the way to be of interest beyond semi-supervised and active learning, for data driven algorithms for combinatorial problems more generally.\n",
      "Sensors are the key to sensing the environment and imparting benefits to smart cities in many aspects, such as providing real-time air quality information throughout an urban area. However, a prerequisite is to obtain fine-grained knowledge of the environment. There is a limit to how many sensors can be installed in the physical world due to non-negligible expenses. In this paper, we propose to infer real-time information of any given location in a city based on historical and current observations from the available sensors (termed spatiotemporal inference). Our approach decouples the modeling of short-term and long-term patterns, relying on two major components. Firstly, unlike previous studies that separated the spatial and temporal relation learning, we introduce a joint spatiotemporal graph attention network that learns the short-term dependencies across both the spatial and temporal dimensions. Secondly, we propose an adaptive graph recurrent network with a time skip for capturing long-term patterns. The adaptive adjacency matrices are learned inductively first as the inputs of a recurrent network to learn dynamic dependencies. Experimental results on four public read-world datasets show that our method reduces state-of-the-art baseline mean absolute errors by 5%~12%.\n",
      "Integrating outside knowledge for reasoning in visio-linguistic tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) is an open problem. Given that pretrained language models have been shown to include world knowledge, we propose to use a unimodal (text-only) train and inference procedure based on automatic off-the-shelf captioning of images and pretrained language models. Our results on a visual question answering task which requires external knowledge (OK-VQA) show that our text-only model outperforms pretrained multimodal (image-text) models of comparable number of parameters. In contrast, our model is less effective in a standard VQA task (VQA 2.0) confirming that our text-only method is specially effective for tasks requiring external knowledge. In addition, we show that our unimodal model is complementary to multimodal models in both OK-VQA and VQA 2.0, and yield the best result to date in OK-VQA among systems not using external knowledge graphs, and comparable to systems that do use them. Our qualitative analysis on OK-VQA reveals that automatic captions often fail to capture relevant information in the images, which seems to be balanced by the better inference ability of the text-only language models. Our work opens up possibilities to further improve inference in visio-linguistic tasks.\n",
      "Existing equivariant neural networks for continuous groups require discretization or group representations. All these approaches require detailed knowledge of the group parametrization and cannot learn entirely new symmetries. We propose to work with the Lie algebra (infinitesimal generators) instead of the Lie group.Our model, the Lie algebra convolutional network (L-conv) can learn potential symmetries and does not require discretization of the group. We show that L-conv can serve as a building block to construct any group equivariant architecture. We discuss how CNNs and Graph Convolutional Networks are related to and can be expressed as L-conv with appropriate groups. We also derive the MSE loss for a single L-conv layer and find a deep relation with Lagrangians used in physics, with some of the physics aiding in defining generalization and symmetries in the loss landscape. Conversely, L-conv could be used to propose more general equivariant ans\\\"atze for scientific machine learning.\n",
      "Provenance is a record that describes how entities, activities, and agents have influenced a piece of data; it is commonly represented as graphs with relevant labels on both their nodes and edges. With the growing adoption of provenance in a wide range of application domains, users are increasingly confronted with an abundance of graph data, which may prove challenging to process. Graph kernels, on the other hand, have been successfully used to efficiently analyse graphs. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph kernel called provenance kernel, which is inspired by and tailored for provenance data. It decomposes a provenance graph into tree-patterns rooted at a given node and considers the labels of edges and nodes up to a certain distance from the root. We employ provenance kernels to classify provenance graphs from three application domains. Our evaluation shows that they perform well in terms of classification accuracy and yield competitive results when compared against existing graph kernel methods and the provenance network analytics method while more efficient in computing time. Moreover, the provenance types used by provenance kernels also help improve the explainability of predictive models built on them.\n",
      "Property inference attacks reveal statistical properties about a training set but are difficult to distinguish from the intrinsic purpose of statistical machine learning, namely to produce models that capture statistical properties about a distribution. Motivated by Yeom et al.'s membership inference framework, we propose a formal and general definition of property inference attacks. The proposed notion describes attacks that can distinguish between possible training distributions, extending beyond previous property inference attacks that infer the ratio of a particular type of data in the training data set such as the proportion of females. We show how our definition captures previous property inference attacks as well as a new attack that can reveal the average node degree or clustering coefficient of a training graph. Our definition also enables a theorem that connects the maximum possible accuracy of inference attacks distinguishing between distributions to the effective size of dataset leaked by the model. To quantify and understand property inference risks, we conduct a series of experiments across a range of different distributions using both black-box and white-box attacks. Our results show that inexpensive attacks are often as effective as expensive meta-classifier attacks, and that there are surprising asymmetries in the effectiveness of attacks. We also extend the state-of-the-art property inference attack to work on convolutional neural networks, and propose techniques to help identify parameters in a model that leak the most information, thus significantly lowering resource requirements for meta-classifier attacks.\n",

      "Recent years have seen the vast potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) in many fields where data is structured as graphs (e.g., chemistry, recommender systems). In particular, GNNs are becoming increasingly popular in the field of networking, as graphs are intrinsically present at many levels (e.g., topology, routing). The main novelty of GNNs is their ability to generalize to other networks unseen during training, which is an essential feature for developing practical Machine Learning (ML) solutions for networking. However, implementing a functional GNN prototype is currently a cumbersome task that requires strong skills in neural network programming. This poses an important barrier to network engineers that often do not have the necessary ML expertise. In this article, we present IGNNITION, a novel open-source framework that enables fast prototyping of GNNs for networking systems. IGNNITION is based on an intuitive high-level abstraction that hides the complexity behind GNNs, while still offering great flexibility to build custom GNN architectures. To showcase the versatility and performance of this framework, we implement two state-of-the-art GNN models applied to different networking use cases. Our results show that the GNN models produced by IGNNITION are equivalent in terms of accuracy and performance to their native implementations in TensorFlow.\n",
      "The multivariate time series forecasting has attracted more and more attention because of its vital role in different fields in the real world, such as finance, traffic, and weather. In recent years, many research efforts have been proposed for forecasting multivariate time series. Although some previous work considers the interdependencies among different variables in the same timestamp, existing work overlooks the inter-connections between different variables at different time stamps. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient instance-wise graph-based framework to utilize the inter-dependencies of different variables at different time stamps for multivariate time series forecasting. The key idea of our framework is aggregating information from the historical time series of different variables to the current time series that we need to forecast. We conduct experiments on the Traffic, Electricity, and Exchange-Rate multivariate time series datasets. The results show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods.\n",
      "Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$, a graph coloring problem involves finding a partition of the vertices into different independent sets. In this paper we present a new framework which combines a deep neural network with the best tools of \"classical\" metaheuristics for graph coloring. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the weighted graph coloring problem and computational results show that the proposed approach allows to obtain new upper bounds for medium and large graphs. A study of the contribution of deep learning in the algorithm highlights that it is possible to learn relevant patterns useful to obtain better solutions to this problem.\n",
      "Automatically discovering a process model from an event log is the prime problem in process mining. This task is so far approached as an unsupervised learning problem through graph synthesis algorithms. Algorithmic design decisions and heuristics allow for efficiently finding models in a reduced search space. However, design decisions and heuristics are derived from assumptions about how a given behavioral description - an event log - translates into a process model and were not learned from actual models which introduce biases in the solutions. In this paper, we explore the problem of supervised learning of a process discovery technique D. We introduce a technique for training an ML-based model D using graph convolutional neural networks; D translates a given input event log into a sound Petri net. We show that training D on synthetically generated pairs of input logs and output models allows D to translate previously unseen synthetic and several real-life event logs into sound, arbitrarily structured models of comparable accuracy and simplicity as existing state of the art techniques for discovering imperative process models. We analyze the limitations of the proposed technique and outline alleys for future work.\n",
      "Recent works leveraging Graph Neural Networks to approach graph matching tasks have shown promising results. Recent progress in learning discrete distributions poses new opportunities for learning graph matching models. In this work, we propose a new model, Stochastic Iterative Graph MAtching (SIGMA), to address the graph matching problem. Our model defines a distribution of matchings for a graph pair so the model can explore a wide range of possible matchings. We further introduce a novel multi-step matching procedure, which learns how to refine a graph pair's matching results incrementally. The model also includes dummy nodes so that the model does not have to find matchings for nodes without correspondence. We fit this model to data via scalable stochastic optimization. We conduct extensive experiments across synthetic graph datasets as well as biochemistry and computer vision applications. Across all tasks, our results show that SIGMA can produce significantly improved graph matching results compared to state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies verify that each of our components (stochastic training, iterative matching, and dummy nodes) offers noticeable improvement.\n",
      "Link prediction is one of the key problems for graph-structured data. With the advancement of graph neural networks, graph autoencoders (GAEs) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) have been proposed to learn graph embeddings in an unsupervised way. It has been shown that these methods are effective for link prediction tasks. However, they do not work well in link predictions when a node whose degree is zero (i.g., isolated node) is involved. We have found that GAEs/VGAEs make embeddings of isolated nodes close to zero regardless of their content features. In this paper, we propose a novel Variational Graph Normalized AutoEncoder (VGNAE) that utilize L2-normalization to derive better embeddings for isolated nodes. We show that our VGNAEs outperform the existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/SeongJinAhn/VGNAE.\n",
      "We present Border-SegGCN, a novel architecture to improve semantic segmentation by refining the border outline using graph convolutional networks (GCN). The semantic segmentation network such as Unet or DeepLabV3+ is used as a base network to have pre-segmented output. This output is converted into a graphical structure and fed into the GCN to improve the border pixel prediction of the pre-segmented output. We explored and studied the factors such as border thickness, number of edges for a node, and the number of features to be fed into the GCN by performing experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Border-SegGCN on the CamVid and Carla dataset, achieving a test set performance of 81.96% without any post-processing on CamVid dataset. It is higher than the reported state of the art mIoU achieved on CamVid dataset by 0.404%\n",
      "In recent years, most fairness strategies in machine learning models focus on mitigating unwanted biases by assuming that the sensitive information is observed. However this is not always possible in practice. Due to privacy purposes and var-ious regulations such as RGPD in EU, many personal sensitive attributes are frequently not collected. We notice a lack of approaches for mitigating bias in such difficult settings, in particular for achieving classical fairness objectives such as Demographic Parity and Equalized Odds. By leveraging recent developments for approximate inference, we propose an approach to fill this gap. Based on a causal graph, we rely on a new variational auto-encoding based framework named SRCVAE to infer a sensitive information proxy, that serve for bias mitigation in an adversarial fairness approach. We empirically demonstrate significant improvements over existing works in the field. We observe that the generated proxy's latent space recovers sensitive information and that our approach achieves a higher accuracy while obtaining the same level of fairness on two real datasets, as measured using com-mon fairness definitions.\n",
      "We propose a score-based DAG structure learning method for time-series data that captures linear, nonlinear, lagged and instantaneous relations among variables while ensuring acyclicity throughout the entire graph. The proposed method extends nonparametric NOTEARS, a recent continuous optimization approach for learning nonparametric instantaneous DAGs. The proposed method is faster than constraint-based methods using nonlinear conditional independence tests. We also promote the use of optimization constraints to incorporate prior knowledge into the structure learning process. A broad set of experiments with simulated data demonstrates that the proposed method discovers better DAG structures than several recent comparison methods. We also evaluate the proposed method on complex real-world data acquired from NHL ice hockey games containing a mixture of continuous and discrete variables. The code is available at https://github.com/xiangyu-sun-789/NTS-NOTEARS/.\n",
      "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning is a crucial task that has gained increasing research interest in recent years. Most existing methods focus on reasoning at past timestamps to complete the missing facts, and there are only a few works of reasoning on known TKGs to forecast future facts. Compared with the completion task, the forecasting task is more difficult that faces two main challenges: (1) how to effectively model the time information to handle future timestamps? (2) how to make inductive inference to handle previously unseen entities that emerge over time? To address these challenges, we propose the first reinforcement learning method for forecasting. Specifically, the agent travels on historical knowledge graph snapshots to search for the answer. Our method defines a relative time encoding function to capture the timespan information, and we design a novel time-shaped reward based on Dirichlet distribution to guide the model learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel representation method for unseen entities to improve the inductive inference ability of the model. We evaluate our method for this link prediction task at future timestamps. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvement meanwhile with higher explainability, less calculation, and fewer parameters when compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Structural features are important features in a geometrical graph. Although there are some correlation analysis of features based on covariance, there is no relevant research on structural feature correlation analysis with graph neural networks. In this paper, we introuduce graph feature to feature (Fea2Fea) prediction pipelines in a low dimensional space to explore some preliminary results on structural feature correlation, which is based on graph neural network. The results show that there exists high correlation between some of the structural features. An irredundant feature combination with initial node features, which is filtered by graph neural network has improved its classification accuracy in some graph-based tasks. We compare differences between concatenation methods on connecting embeddings between features and show that the simplest is the best. We generalize on the synthetic geometric graphs and certify the results on prediction difficulty between structural features.\n",
      "Smart factories are equipped with machines that can sense their manufacturing environments, interact with each other, and control production processes. Smooth operation of such factories requires that the machines and engineering personnel that conduct their monitoring and diagnostics share a detailed common industrial knowledge about the factory, e.g., in the form of knowledge graphs. Creation and maintenance of such knowledge is expensive and requires automation. In this work we show how machine learning that is specifically tailored towards industrial applications can help in knowledge graph completion. In particular, we show how knowledge completion can benefit from event logs that are common in smart factories. We evaluate this on the knowledge graph from a real world-inspired smart factory with encouraging results.\n",
      "Graph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly growing thanks to the capacity of GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured data. However, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN training is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and commercial competitions. Federated learning (FL), a trending distributed learning paradigm, provides possibilities to solve this challenge while preserving data privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language domains, there is no suitable platform for the FL of GNNs. To this end, we introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research on federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is built on a unified formulation of graph FL and contains a wide range of datasets from different domains, popular GNN models, and FL algorithms, with secure and efficient system support. Particularly for the datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains, including both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as hERG and Tencent. Our empirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark system, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs perform worse in most datasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the GNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not maintain its advantage in the FL setting. These results imply that more research efforts are needed to unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs. Moreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN system is computationally efficient and secure to large-scale graphs datasets. We maintain the source code at https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedGraphNN.\n",
      "The recent progress in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning(MADRL) makes it more practical in real-world tasks, but its relatively poor scalability and the partially observable constraints raise challenges to its performance and deployment. Based on our intuitive observation that the human society could be regarded as a large-scale partially observable environment, where each individual has the function of communicating with neighbors and remembering its own experience, we propose a novel network structure called hierarchical graph recurrent network(HGRN) for multi-agent cooperation under partial observability. Specifically, we construct the multi-agent system as a graph, use the hierarchical graph attention network(HGAT) to achieve communication between neighboring agents, and exploit GRU to enable agents to record historical information. To encourage exploration and improve robustness, we design a maximum-entropy learning method to learn stochastic policies of a configurable target action entropy. Based on the above technologies, we proposed a value-based MADRL algorithm called Soft-HGRN and its actor-critic variant named SAC-HRGN. Experimental results based on three homogeneous tasks and one heterogeneous environment not only show that our approach achieves clear improvements compared with four baselines, but also demonstrates the interpretability, scalability, and transferability of the proposed model. Ablation studies prove the function and necessity of each component.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to learning representation on graphs in many relational tasks. Recently, researchers study neural architecture search (NAS) to reduce the dependence of human expertise and explore better GNN architectures, but they over-emphasize entity features and ignore latent relation information concealed in the edges. To solve this problem, we incorporate edge features into graph search space and propose Edge-featured Graph Neural Architecture Search to find the optimal GNN architecture. Specifically, we design rich entity and edge updating operations to learn high-order representations, which convey more generic message passing mechanisms. Moreover, the architecture topology in our search space allows to explore complex feature dependence of both entities and edges, which can be efficiently optimized by differentiable search strategy. Experiments at three graph tasks on six datasets show EGNAS can search better GNNs with higher performance than current state-of-the-art human-designed and searched-based GNNs.\n",
      "Semantic information provides intra-class consistency and inter-class discriminability beyond visual concepts, which has been employed in Few-Shot Learning (FSL) to achieve further gains. However, semantic information is only available for labeled samples but absent for unlabeled samples, in which the embeddings are rectified unilaterally by guiding the few labeled samples with semantics. Therefore, it is inevitable to bring a cross-modal bias between semantic-guided samples and nonsemantic-guided samples, which results in an information asymmetry problem. To address this problem, we propose a Modal-Alternating Propagation Network (MAP-Net) to supplement the absent semantic information of unlabeled samples, which builds information symmetry among all samples in both visual and semantic modalities. Specifically, the MAP-Net transfers the neighbor information by the graph propagation to generate the pseudo-semantics for unlabeled samples guided by the completed visual relationships and rectify the feature embeddings. In addition, due to the large discrepancy between visual and semantic modalities, we design a Relation Guidance (RG) strategy to guide the visual relation vectors via semantics so that the propagated information is more beneficial. Extensive experimental results on three semantic-labeled datasets, i.e., Caltech-UCSD-Birds 200-2011, SUN Attribute Database, and Oxford 102 Flower, have demonstrated that our proposed method achieves promising performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, which indicates the necessity of information symmetry.\n",
      "Graph feature extraction is a fundamental task in graphs analytics. Using feature vectors (graph descriptors) in tandem with data mining algorithms that operate on Euclidean data, one can solve problems such as classification, clustering, and anomaly detection on graph-structured data. This idea has proved fruitful in the past, with spectral-based graph descriptors providing state-of-the-art classification accuracy on benchmark datasets. However, these algorithms do not scale to large graphs since: 1) they require storing the entire graph in memory, and 2) the end-user has no control over the algorithm's runtime. In this paper, we present single-pass streaming algorithms to approximate structural features of graphs (counts of subgraphs of order $k \\geq 4$). Operating on edge streams allows us to avoid keeping the entire graph in memory, and controlling the sample size enables us to control the time taken by the algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of our descriptors by analyzing the approximation error, classification accuracy, and scalability to massive graphs. Our experiments showcase the effect of the sample size on approximation error and predictive accuracy. The proposed descriptors are applicable on graphs with millions of edges within minutes and outperform the state-of-the-art descriptors in classification accuracy.\n",
      "Adversarial attacks on graphs have attracted considerable research interests. Existing works assume the attacker is either (partly) aware of the victim model, or able to send queries to it. These assumptions are, however, unrealistic. To bridge the gap between theoretical graph attacks and real-world scenarios, in this work, we propose a novel and more realistic setting: strict black-box graph attack, in which the attacker has no knowledge about the victim model at all and is not allowed to send any queries. To design such an attack strategy, we first propose a generic graph filter to unify different families of graph-based models. The strength of attacks can then be quantified by the change in the graph filter before and after attack. By maximizing this change, we are able to find an effective attack strategy, regardless of the underlying model. To solve this optimization problem, we also propose a relaxation technique and approximation theories to reduce the difficulty as well as the computational expense. Experiments demonstrate that, even with no exposure to the model, the Macro-F1 drops 6.4% in node classification and 29.5% in graph classification, which is a significant result compared with existent works.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs), which learn the node representations by recursively aggregating information from its neighbors, have become a predominant computational tool in many domains. To handle large-scale graphs, most of the existing methods partition the input graph into multiple sub-graphs (e.g., through node clustering) and apply batch training to save memory cost. However, such batch training will lead to label bias within each batch, and then result in over-confidence in model predictions. Since the connected nodes with positively related labels tend to be assigned together, the traditional cross-entropy minimization process will attend on the predictions of biased classes in the batch, and may intensify the overfitting issue. To overcome the label bias problem, we propose the adaptive label smoothing (ALS) method to replace the one-hot hard labels with smoothed ones, which learns to allocate label confidences from the biased classes to the others. Specifically, ALS propagates node labels to aggregate the neighborhood label distribution in a pre-processing step, and then updates the optimal smoothed labels online to adapt to specific graph structure. Experiments on the real-world datasets demonstrate that ALS can be generally applied to the main scalable learning frameworks to calibrate the biased labels and improve generalization performances.\n",
      "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as the core enabler of many major applications on mobile devices. To achieve high accuracy, DNN models have become increasingly deep with hundreds or even thousands of operator layers, leading to high memory and computational requirements for inference. Operator fusion (or kernel/layer fusion) is key optimization in many state-of-the-art DNN execution frameworks, such as TensorFlow, TVM, and MNN. However, these frameworks usually adopt fusion approaches based on certain patterns that are too restrictive to cover the diversity of operators and layer connections. Polyhedral-based loop fusion techniques, on the other hand, work on a low-level view of the computation without operator-level information, and can also miss potential fusion opportunities. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel and extensive loop fusion framework called DNNFusion. The basic idea of this work is to work at an operator view of DNNs, but expand fusion opportunities by developing a classification of both individual operators and their combinations. In addition, DNNFusion includes 1) a novel mathematical-property-based graph rewriting framework to reduce evaluation costs and facilitate subsequent operator fusion, 2) an integrated fusion plan generation that leverages the high-level analysis and accurate light-weight profiling, and 3) additional optimizations during fusion code generation. DNNFusion is extensively evaluated on 15 DNN models with varied types of tasks, model sizes, and layer counts. The evaluation results demonstrate that DNNFusion finds up to 8.8x higher fusion opportunities, outperforms four state-of-the-art DNN execution frameworks with 9.3x speedup. The memory requirement reduction and speedups can enable the execution of many of the target models on mobile devices and even make them part of a real-time application.\n",
      "Drug repurposing is more relevant than ever due to drug development's rising costs and the need to respond to emerging diseases quickly. Knowledge graph embedding enables drug repurposing using heterogeneous data sources combined with state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict new drug-disease links in the knowledge graph. As in many machine learning applications, significant work is still required to understand the predictive models' behavior. We propose a structured methodology to understand better machine learning models' results for drug repurposing, suggesting key elements of the knowledge graph to improve predictions while saving computational resources. We reduce the training set of 11.05% and the embedding space by 31.87%, with only a 2% accuracy reduction, and increase accuracy by 60% on the open ogbl-biokg graph adding only 1.53% new triples.\n",
      "We demonstrate a library for the integration of domain knowledge in deep learning architectures. Using this library, the structure of the data is expressed symbolically via graph declarations and the logical constraints over outputs or latent variables can be seamlessly added to the deep models. The domain knowledge can be defined explicitly, which improves the models' explainability in addition to the performance and generalizability in the low-data regime. Several approaches for such an integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic models have been introduced; however, there is no library to facilitate the programming for such an integration in a generic way while various underlying algorithms can be used. Our library aims to simplify programming for such an integration in both training and inference phases while separating the knowledge representation from learning algorithms. We showcase various NLP benchmark tasks and beyond. The framework is publicly available at Github(https://github.com/HLR/DomiKnowS).\n",
      "Estimation of causal effects involves crucial assumptions about the data-generating process, such as directionality of effect, presence of instrumental variables or mediators, and whether all relevant confounders are observed. Violation of any of these assumptions leads to significant error in the effect estimate. However, unlike cross-validation for predictive models, there is no global validator method for a causal estimate. As a result, expressing different causal assumptions formally and validating them (to the extent possible) becomes critical for any analysis. We present DoWhy, a framework that allows explicit declaration of assumptions through a causal graph and provides multiple validation tests to check a subset of these assumptions. Our experience with DoWhy highlights a number of open questions for future research: developing new ways beyond causal graphs to express assumptions, the role of causal discovery in learning relevant parts of the graph, and developing validation tests that can better detect errors, both for average and conditional treatment effects. DoWhy is available at https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy.\n",
      "Deep learning models are modern tools for spatio-temporal graph (STG) forecasting. Despite their effectiveness, they require large-scale datasets to achieve better performance and are vulnerable to noise perturbation. To alleviate these limitations, an intuitive idea is to use the popular data augmentation and contrastive learning techniques. However, existing graph contrastive learning methods cannot be directly applied to STG forecasting due to three reasons. First, we empirically discover that the forecasting task is unable to benefit from the pretrained representations derived from contrastive learning. Second, data augmentations that are used for defeating noise are less explored for STG data. Third, the semantic similarity of samples has been overlooked. In this paper, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Graph Contrastive Learning framework (STGCL) to tackle these issues. Specifically, we improve the performance by integrating the forecasting loss with an auxiliary contrastive loss rather than using a pretrained paradigm. We elaborate on four types of data augmentations, which disturb data in terms of graph structure, time domain, and frequency domain. We also extend the classic contrastive loss through a rule-based strategy that filters out the most semantically similar negatives. Our framework is evaluated across three real-world datasets and four state-of-the-art models. The consistent improvements demonstrate that STGCL can be used as an off-the-shelf plug-in for existing deep models.\n",
      "Learning node representation on dynamically-evolving, multi-relational graph data has gained great research interest. However, most of the existing models for temporal knowledge graph forecasting use Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with discrete depth to capture temporal information, while time is a continuous variable. Inspired by Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE), we extend the idea of continuum-depth models to time-evolving multi-relational graph data, and propose a novel Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting model with NODE. Our model captures temporal information through NODE and structural information through a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Thus, our graph ODE model achieves a continuous model in time and efficiently learns node representation for future prediction. We evaluate our model on six temporal knowledge graph datasets by performing link forecasting. Experiment results show the superiority of our model.\n",
      "Shape correspondence from 3D deformation learning has attracted appealing academy interests recently. Nevertheless, current deep learning based methods require the supervision of dense annotations to learn per-point translations, which severely overparameterize the deformation process. Moreover, they fail to capture local geometric details of original shape via global feature embedding. To address these challenges, we develop a new Unsupervised Dense Deformation Embedding Network (i.e., UD^2E-Net), which learns to predict deformations between non-rigid shapes from dense local features. Since it is non-trivial to match deformation-variant local features for deformation prediction, we develop an Extrinsic-Intrinsic Autoencoder to frst encode extrinsic geometric features from source into intrinsic coordinates in a shared canonical shape, with which the decoder then synthesizes corresponding target features. Moreover, a bounded maximum mean discrepancy loss is developed to mitigate the distribution divergence between the synthesized and original features. To learn natural deformation without dense supervision, we introduce a coarse parameterized deformation graph, for which a novel trace and propagation algorithm is proposed to improve both the quality and effciency of the deformation. Our UD^2E-Net outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by 24% on Faust Inter challenge and even supervised methods by 13% on Faust Intra challenge.\n",
      "We propose a multiscale spatio-temporal graph neural network (MST-GNN) to predict the future 3D skeleton-based human poses in an action-category-agnostic manner. The core of MST-GNN is a multiscale spatio-temporal graph that explicitly models the relations in motions at various spatial and temporal scales. Different from many previous hierarchical structures, our multiscale spatio-temporal graph is built in a data-adaptive fashion, which captures nonphysical, yet motion-based relations. The key module of MST-GNN is a multiscale spatio-temporal graph computational unit (MST-GCU) based on the trainable graph structure. MST-GCU embeds underlying features at individual scales and then fuses features across scales to obtain a comprehensive representation. The overall architecture of MST-GNN follows an encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder consists of a sequence of MST-GCUs to learn the spatial and temporal features of motions, and the decoder uses a graph-based attention gate recurrent unit (GA-GRU) to generate future poses. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that the proposed MST-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short and long-term motion prediction on the datasets of Human 3.6M, CMU Mocap and 3DPW, where MST-GNN outperforms previous works by 5.33% and 3.67% of mean angle errors in average for short-term and long-term prediction on Human 3.6M, and by 11.84% and 4.71% of mean angle errors for short-term and long-term prediction on CMU Mocap, and by 1.13% of mean angle errors on 3DPW in average, respectively. We further investigate the learned multiscale graphs for interpretability.\n",
      "Recently, the graph neural network (GNN) has shown great power in matrix completion by formulating a rating matrix as a bipartite graph and then predicting the link between the corresponding user and item nodes. The majority of GNN-based matrix completion methods are based on Graph Autoencoder (GAE), which considers the one-hot index as input, maps a user (or item) index to a learnable embedding, applies a GNN to learn the node-specific representations based on these learnable embeddings and finally aggregates the representations of the target users and its corresponding item nodes to predict missing links. However, without node content (i.e., side information) for training, the user (or item) specific representation can not be learned in the inductive setting, that is, a model trained on one group of users (or items) cannot adapt to new users (or items). To this end, we propose an inductive matrix completion method using GAE (IMC-GAE), which utilizes the GAE to learn both the user-specific (or item-specific) representation for personalized recommendation and local graph patterns for inductive matrix completion. Specifically, we design two informative node features and employ a layer-wise node dropout scheme in GAE to learn local graph patterns which can be generalized to unseen data. The main contribution of our paper is the capability to efficiently learn local graph patterns in GAE, with good scalability and superior expressiveness compared to previous GNN-based matrix completion methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several matrix completion benchmarks. Our official code is publicly available.\n",
      "This paper aims to unify spatial dependency and temporal dependency in a non-Euclidean space while capturing the inner spatial-temporal dependencies for spatial-temporal graph data. For spatial-temporal attribute entities with topological structure, the space-time is consecutive and unified while each node's current status is influenced by its neighbors' past states over variant periods of each neighbor. Most spatial-temporal neural networks study spatial dependency and temporal correlation separately in processing, gravely impaired the space-time continuum, and ignore the fact that the neighbors' temporal dependency period for a node can be delayed and dynamic. To model this actual condition, we propose TraverseNet, a novel spatial-temporal graph neural network, viewing space and time as an inseparable whole, to mine spatial-temporal graphs while exploiting the evolving spatial-temporal dependencies for each node via message traverse mechanisms. Experiments with ablation and parameter studies have validated the effectiveness of the proposed TraverseNets, and the detailed implementation can be found from https://github.com/nnzhan/TraverseNet.\n",
      "Training deep graph neural networks (GNNs) is notoriously hard. Besides the standard plights in training deep architectures such as vanishing gradients and overfitting, the training of deep GNNs also uniquely suffers from over-smoothing, information squashing, and so on, which limits their potential power on large-scale graphs. Although numerous efforts are proposed to address these limitations, such as various forms of skip connections, graph normalization, and random dropping, it is difficult to disentangle the advantages brought by a deep GNN architecture from those \"tricks\" necessary to train such an architecture. Moreover, the lack of a standardized benchmark with fair and consistent experimental settings poses an almost insurmountable obstacle to gauging the effectiveness of new mechanisms. In view of those, we present the first fair and reproducible benchmark dedicated to assessing the \"tricks\" of training deep GNNs. We categorize existing approaches, investigate their hyperparameter sensitivity, and unify the basic configuration. Comprehensive evaluations are then conducted on tens of representative graph datasets including the recent large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), with diverse deep GNN backbones. Based on synergistic studies, we discover the combo of superior training tricks, that lead us to attain the new state-of-the-art results for deep GCNs, across multiple representative graph datasets. We demonstrate that an organic combo of initial connection, identity mapping, group and batch normalization has the most ideal performance on large datasets. Experiments also reveal a number of \"surprises\" when combining or scaling up some of the tricks. All codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Deep_GCN_Benchmarking.\n",
      "Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) are becoming a preferred model for data processing on irregular domains, yet their analysis and principles of operation are rarely examined due to the black box nature of NNs. To this end, we revisit the operation of GCNNs and show that their convolution layers effectively perform matched filtering of input data with the chosen patterns (features). This allows us to provide a unifying account of GCNNs through a matched filter perspective, whereby the nonlinear ReLU and max-pooling layers are also discussed within the matched filtering framework. This is followed by a step-by-step guide on information propagation and learning in GCNNs. It is also shown that standard CNNs and fully connected NNs can be obtained as a special case of GCNNs. A carefully chosen numerical example guides the reader through the various steps of GCNN operation and learning both visually and numerically.\n",
      "In recent years, inductive graph embedding models, \\emph{viz.}, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become increasingly accurate at link prediction (LP) in online social networks. The performance of such networks depends strongly on the input node features, which vary across networks and applications. Selecting appropriate node features remains application-dependent and generally an open question. Moreover, owing to privacy and ethical issues, use of personalized node features is often restricted. In fact, many publicly available data from online social network do not contain any node features (e.g., demography). In this work, we provide a comprehensive experimental analysis which shows that harnessing a transductive technique (e.g., Node2Vec) for obtaining initial node representations, after which an inductive node embedding technique takes over, leads to substantial improvements in link prediction accuracy. We demonstrate that, for a wide variety of GNN variants, node representation vectors obtained from Node2Vec serve as high quality input features to GNNs, thereby improving LP performance.\n",
      "This paper presents a deep relational metric learning (DRML) framework for image clustering and retrieval. Most existing deep metric learning methods learn an embedding space with a general objective of increasing interclass distances and decreasing intraclass distances. However, the conventional losses of metric learning usually suppress intraclass variations which might be helpful to identify samples of unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose to adaptively learn an ensemble of features that characterizes an image from different aspects to model both interclass and intraclass distributions. We further employ a relational module to capture the correlations among each feature in the ensemble and construct a graph to represent an image. We then perform relational inference on the graph to integrate the ensemble and obtain a relation-aware embedding to measure the similarities. Extensive experiments on the widely-used CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products datasets demonstrate that our framework improves existing deep metric learning methods and achieves very competitive results.\n",
      "A smart Ponzi scheme is a new form of economic crime that uses Ethereum smart contract account and cryptocurrency to implement Ponzi scheme. The smart Ponzi scheme has harmed the interests of many investors, but researches on smart Ponzi scheme detection is still very limited. The existing smart Ponzi scheme detection methods have the problems of requiring many human resources in feature engineering and poor model portability. To solve these problems, we propose a data-driven smart Ponzi scheme detection system in this paper. The system uses dynamic graph embedding technology to automatically learn the representation of an account based on multi-source and multi-modal data related to account transactions. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed system requires very limited human-computer interaction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to implement smart Ponzi scheme detection through dynamic graph embedding. Experimental results show that this method is significantly better than the existing smart Ponzi scheme detection methods.\n",
      "This paper introduces Click to Move (C2M), a novel framework for video generation where the user can control the motion of the synthesized video through mouse clicks specifying simple object trajectories of the key objects in the scene. Our model receives as input an initial frame, its corresponding segmentation map and the sparse motion vectors encoding the input provided by the user. It outputs a plausible video sequence starting from the given frame and with a motion that is consistent with user input. Notably, our proposed deep architecture incorporates a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) modelling the movements of all the objects in the scene in a holistic manner and effectively combining the sparse user motion information and image features. Experimental results show that C2M outperforms existing methods on two publicly available datasets, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our GCN framework at modelling object interactions. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/PierfrancescoArdino/C2M.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs), has been widely used for supervised learning tasks in graphs reaching state-of-the-art results. However, little work was dedicated to creating unbiased GNNs, i.e., where the classification is uncorrelated with sensitive attributes, such as race or gender. Some ignore the sensitive attributes or optimize for the criteria of statistical parity for fairness. However, it has been shown that neither approaches ensure fairness, but rather cripple the utility of the prediction task. In this work, we present a GNN framework that allows optimizing representations for the notion of Equalized Odds fairness criteria. The architecture is composed of three components: (1) a GNN classifier predicting the utility class, (2) a sampler learning the distribution of the sensitive attributes of the nodes given their labels. It generates samples fed into a (3) discriminator that discriminates between true and sampled sensitive attributes using a novel \"permutation loss\" function. Using these components, we train a model to neglect information regarding the sensitive attribute only with respect to its label. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to optimize GNNs for the equalized odds criteria. We evaluate our classifier over several graph datasets and sensitive attributes and show our algorithm reaches state-of-the-art results.\n",
      "A table arranging data in rows and columns is a very effective data structure, which has been widely used in business and scientific research. Considering large-scale tabular data in online and offline documents, automatic table recognition has attracted increasing attention from the document analysis community. Though human can easily understand the structure of tables, it remains a challenge for machines to understand that, especially due to a variety of different table layouts and styles. Existing methods usually model a table as either the markup sequence or the adjacency matrix between different table cells, failing to address the importance of the logical location of table cells, e.g., a cell is located in the first row and the second column of the table. In this paper, we reformulate the problem of table structure recognition as the table graph reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end trainable table graph reconstruction network (TGRNet) for table structure recognition. Specifically, the proposed method has two main branches, a cell detection branch and a cell logical location branch, to jointly predict the spatial location and the logical location of different cells. Experimental results on three popular table recognition datasets and a new dataset with table graph annotations (TableGraph-350K) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TGRNet for table structure recognition. Code and annotations will be made publicly available.\n",
      "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has recently gained increased attention, as a class of approaches that automatically searches in an input space of network architectures. A crucial part of the NAS pipeline is the encoding of the architecture that consists of the applied computational blocks, namely the operations and the links between them. Most of the existing approaches either fail to capture the structural properties of the architectures or use hand-engineered vector to encode the operator information. In this paper, we propose the replacement of fixed operator encoding with learnable representations in the optimization process. This approach, which effectively captures the relations of different operations, leads to smoother and more accurate representations of the architectures and consequently to improved performance of the end task. Our extensive evaluation in ENAS benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed operation embeddings to the generation of highly accurate models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Finally, our method produces top-performing architectures that share similar operation and graph patterns, highlighting a strong correlation between the structural properties of the architecture and its performance.\n",
      "We address the problem of detecting human-object interactions in images using graphical neural networks. Unlike conventional methods, where nodes send scaled but otherwise identical messages to each of their neighbours, we propose to condition messages between pairs of nodes on their spatial relationships, resulting in different messages going to neighbours of the same node. To this end, we explore various ways of applying spatial conditioning under a multi-branch structure. Through extensive experimentation we demonstrate the advantages of spatial conditioning for the computation of the adjacency structure, messages and the refined graph features. In particular, we empirically show that as the quality of the bounding boxes increases, their coarse appearance features contribute relatively less to the disambiguation of interactions compared to the spatial information. Our method achieves an mAP of 31.33% on HICO-DET and 54.2% on V-COCO, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art on fine-tuned detections.\n",
      "The nonlocal-based blocks are designed for capturing long-range spatial-temporal dependencies in computer vision tasks. Although having shown excellent performance, they still lack the mechanism to encode the rich, structured information among elements in an image or video. In this paper, to theoretically analyze the property of these nonlocal-based blocks, we provide a new perspective to interpret them, where we view them as a set of graph filters generated on a fully-connected graph. Specifically, when choosing the Chebyshev graph filter, a unified formulation can be derived for explaining and analyzing the existing nonlocal-based blocks (e.g., nonlocal block, nonlocal stage, double attention block). Furthermore, by concerning the property of spectral, we propose an efficient and robust spectral nonlocal block, which can be more robust and flexible to catch long-range dependencies when inserted into deep neural networks than the existing nonlocal blocks. Experimental results demonstrate the clear-cut improvements and practical applicabilities of our method on image classification, action recognition, semantic segmentation, and person re-identification tasks.\n",
      "Multi-view network embedding aims at projecting nodes in the network to low-dimensional vectors, while preserving their multiple relations and attribute information. Contrastive learning-based methods have preliminarily shown promising performance in this task. However, most contrastive learning-based methods mostly rely on high-quality graph embedding and explore less on the relationships between different graph views. To deal with these deficiencies, we design a novel node-to-node Contrastive learning framework for Multi-view network Embedding (CREME), which mainly contains two contrastive objectives: Multi-view fusion InfoMax and Inter-view InfoMin. The former objective distills information from embeddings generated from different graph views, while the latter distinguishes different graph views better to capture the complementary information between them. Specifically, we first apply a view encoder to generate each graph view representation and utilize a multi-view aggregator to fuse these representations. Then, we unify the two contrastive objectives into one learning objective for training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that CREME outperforms existing methods consistently.\n",
      "Real-world recommender system needs to be regularly retrained to keep with the new data. In this work, we consider how to efficiently retrain graph convolution network (GCN) based recommender models, which are state-of-the-art techniques for collaborative recommendation. To pursue high efficiency, we set the target as using only new data for model updating, meanwhile not sacrificing the recommendation accuracy compared with full model retraining. This is non-trivial to achieve, since the interaction data participates in both the graph structure for model construction and the loss function for model learning, whereas the old graph structure is not allowed to use in model updating. Towards the goal, we propose a \\textit{Causal Incremental Graph Convolution} approach, which consists of two new operators named \\textit{Incremental Graph Convolution} (IGC) and \\textit{Colliding Effect Distillation} (CED) to estimate the output of full graph convolution. In particular, we devise simple and effective modules for IGC to ingeniously combine the old representations and the incremental graph and effectively fuse the long-term and short-term preference signals. CED aims to avoid the out-of-date issue of inactive nodes that are not in the incremental graph, which connects the new data with inactive nodes through causal inference. In particular, CED estimates the causal effect of new data on the representation of inactive nodes through the control of their collider. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate both accuracy gains and significant speed-ups over the existing retraining mechanism.\n",
      "Accurate traffic state prediction is the foundation of transportation control and guidance. It is very challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic data. Existing works cannot perform well for multi-step traffic prediction that involves long future time period. The spatiotemporal information dilution becomes serve when the time gap between input step and predicted step is large, especially when traffic data is not sufficient or noisy. To address this issue, we propose a multi-spatial graph convolution based Seq2Seq model. Our main novelties are three aspects: (1) We enrich the spatiotemporal information of model inputs by fusing multi-view features (time, location and traffic states) (2) We build multiple kinds of spatial correlations based on both prior knowledge and data-driven knowledge to improve model performance especially in insufficient or noisy data cases. (3) A spatiotemporal attention mechanism based on reachability knowledge is novelly designed to produce high-level features fed into decoder of Seq2Seq directly to ease information dilution. Our model is evaluated on two real world traffic datasets and achieves better performance than other competitors.\n",
      "The past decade has seen a rapid penetration of electric vehicles (EV) in the market, more and more logistics and transportation companies start to deploy EVs for service provision. In order to model the operations of a commercial EV fleet, we utilize the EV routing problem with time windows (EVRPTW). In this research, we propose an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework to solve the EVRPTW. In particular, we develop an attention model incorporating the pointer network and a graph embedding technique to parameterize a stochastic policy for solving the EVRPTW. The model is then trained using policy gradient with rollout baseline. Our numerical studies show that the proposed model is able to efficiently solve EVRPTW instances of large sizes that are not solvable with any existing approaches.\n",
      "We propose a new general Graph Adversarial Domain Adaptation (GADA) based on semantic knowledge reasoning of class structure for solving the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from the big data with non-shared and imbalanced classes to specified small and imbalanced applications (NI-UDA), where non-shared classes mean the label space out of the target domain. Our goal is to leverage priori hierarchy knowledge to enhance domain adversarial aligned feature representation with graph reasoning. In this paper, to address two challenges in NI-UDA, we equip adversarial domain adaptation with Hierarchy Graph Reasoning (HGR) layer and the Source Classifier Filter (SCF). For sparse classes transfer challenge, our HGR layer can aggregate local feature to hierarchy graph nodes by node prediction and enhance domain adversarial aligned feature with hierarchy graph reasoning for sparse classes. Our HGR contributes to learn direct semantic patterns for sparse classes by hierarchy attention in self-attention, non-linear mapping and graph normalization. our SCF is proposed for the challenge of knowledge sharing from non-shared data without negative transfer effect by filtering low-confidence non-shared data in HGR layer. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show our GADA methods consistently improve the state-of-the-art adversarial UDA algorithms, e.g. GADA(HGR) can greatly improve f1 of the MDD by \\textbf{7.19\\%} and GVB-GD by \\textbf{7.89\\%} respectively on imbalanced source task in Meal300 dataset.

      "The RDF2vec method for creating node embeddings on knowledge graphs is based on word2vec, which, in turn, is agnostic towards the position of context words. In this paper, we argue that this might be a shortcoming when training RDF2vec, and show that using a word2vec variant which respects order yields considerable performance gains especially on tasks where entities of different classes are involved.\n",
      "As the field of machine learning for combinatorial optimization advances, traditional problems are resurfaced and readdressed through this new perspective. The overwhelming majority of the literature focuses on small graph problems, while several real-world problems are devoted to large graphs. Here, we focus on two such problems that are related: influence estimation, a \\#P-hard counting problem, and influence maximization, an NP-hard problem. We develop GLIE, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that inherently parameterizes an upper bound of influence estimation and train it on small simulated graphs. Experiments show that GLIE can provide accurate predictions faster than the alternatives for graphs 10 times larger than the train set. More importantly, it can be used on arbitrary large graphs for influence maximization, as the predictions can rank effectively seed sets even when the accuracy deteriorates. To showcase this, we propose a version of a standard Influence Maximization (IM) algorithm where we substitute traditional influence estimation with the predictions of GLIE.We also transfer GLIE into a reinforcement learning model that learns how to choose seeds to maximize influence sequentially using GLIE's hidden representations and predictions. The final results show that the proposed methods surpasses a previous GNN-RL approach and perform on par with a state-of-the-art IM algorithm.\n",
      "Given the increasing promise of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in real-world applications, several methods have been developed for explaining their predictions. So far, these methods have primarily focused on generating subgraphs that are especially relevant for a particular prediction. However, such methods do not provide a clear opportunity for recourse: given a prediction, we want to understand how the prediction can be changed in order to achieve a more desirable outcome. In this work, we propose a method for generating counterfactual (CF) explanations for GNNs: the minimal perturbation to the input (graph) data such that the prediction changes. Using only edge deletions, we find that our method, CF-GNNExplainer can generate CF explanations for the majority of instances across three widely used datasets for GNN explanations, while removing less than 3 edges on average, with at least 94\\% accuracy. This indicates that CF-GNNExplainer primarily removes edges that are crucial for the original predictions, resulting in minimal CF explanations.\n",
      "Deep learning's performance has been extensively recognized recently. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to deal with graph-structural data that classical deep learning does not easily manage. Since most GNNs were created using distinct theories, direct comparisons are impossible. Prior research has primarily concentrated on categorizing existing models, with little attention paid to their intrinsic connections. The purpose of this study is to establish a unified framework that integrates GNNs based on spectral graph and approximation theory. The framework incorporates a strong integration between spatial- and spectral-based GNNs while tightly associating approaches that exist within each respective domain.\n",
      "While the celebrated graph neural networks yield effective representations for individual nodes of a graph, there has been relatively less success in extending to the task of graph similarity learning. Recent work on graph similarity learning has considered either global-level graph-graph interactions or low-level node-node interactions, however ignoring the rich cross-level interactions (e.g., between each node of one graph and the other whole graph). In this paper, we propose a multi-level graph matching network (MGMN) framework for computing the graph similarity between any pair of graph-structured objects in an end-to-end fashion. In particular, the proposed MGMN consists of a node-graph matching network for effectively learning cross-level interactions between each node of one graph and the other whole graph, and a siamese graph neural network to learn global-level interactions between two input graphs. Furthermore, to compensate for the lack of standard benchmark datasets, we have created and collected a set of datasets for both the graph-graph classification and graph-graph regression tasks with different sizes in order to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MGMN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on both the graph-graph classification and graph-graph regression tasks. Compared with previous work, MGMN also exhibits stronger robustness as the sizes of the two input graphs increase.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have boosted the performance for many graph-related tasks. Despite the great success, recent studies have shown that GNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where adversaries can mislead the GNNs' prediction by modifying graphs. On the other hand, the explanation of GNNs (GNNExplainer) provides a better understanding of a trained GNN model by generating a small subgraph and features that are most influential for its prediction. In this paper, we first perform empirical studies to validate that GNNExplainer can act as an inspection tool and have the potential to detect the adversarial perturbations for graphs. This finding motivates us to further initiate a new problem investigation: Whether a graph neural network and its explanations can be jointly attacked by modifying graphs with malicious desires? It is challenging to answer this question since the goals of adversarial attacks and bypassing the GNNExplainer essentially contradict each other. In this work, we give a confirmative answer to this question by proposing a novel attack framework (GEAttack), which can attack both a GNN model and its explanations by simultaneously exploiting their vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on two explainers (GNNExplainer and PGExplainer) under various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",
      "Bayesian networks are a widely-used class of probabilistic graphical models capable of representing symmetric conditional independence between variables of interest using the topology of the underlying graph. They can be seen as a special case of the much more general class of models called staged trees, which can represent any type of non-symmetric conditional independence. Here we formalize the relationship between these two models and introduce a minimal Bayesian network representation of the staged tree, which can be used to read conditional independences in an intuitive way. Furthermore, we define a new labeled graph, termed asymmetry-labeled directed acyclic graph, whose edges are labeled to denote the type of dependence existing between any two random variables. Various datasets are used to illustrate the methodology, highlighting the need to construct models which more flexibly encode and represent non-symmetric structures.\n",
      "One of the core assumptions in causal discovery is the faithfulness assumption, i.e., assuming that independencies found in the data are due to separations in the true causal graph. This assumption can, however, be violated in many ways, including xor connections, deterministic functions or cancelling paths. In this work, we propose a weaker assumption that we call $2$-adjacency faithfulness. In contrast to adjacency faithfulness, which assumes that there is no conditional independence between each pair of variables that are connected in the causal graph, we only require no conditional independence between a node and a subset of its Markov blanket that can contain up to two nodes. Equivalently, we adapt orientation faithfulness to this setting. We further propose a sound orientation rule for causal discovery that applies under weaker assumptions. As a proof of concept, we derive a modified Grow and Shrink algorithm that recovers the Markov blanket of a target node and prove its correctness under strictly weaker assumptions than the standard faithfulness assumption.\n",
      "Deep neural networks have been applied to a wide range of problems across different application domains with great success. Recently, research into combinatorial optimization problems in particular has generated much interest in the machine learning community. In this work, we develop deep learning models to predict the chromatic number and maximum clique size of graphs, both of which represent classical NP-complete combinatorial optimization problems encountered in graph theory. The neural networks are trained using the most basic representation of the graph, the adjacency matrix, as opposed to undergoing complex domain-specific feature engineering. The experimental results show that deep neural networks, and in particular convolutional neural networks, obtain strong performance on this problem.\n",
      "Motion forecasting plays a significant role in various domains (e.g., autonomous driving, human-robot interaction), which aims to predict future motion sequences given a set of historical observations. However, the observed elements may be of different levels of importance. Some information may be irrelevant or even distracting to the forecasting in certain situations. To address this issue, we propose a generic motion forecasting framework (named RAIN) with dynamic key information selection and ranking based on a hybrid attention mechanism. The general framework is instantiated to handle multi-agent trajectory prediction and human motion forecasting tasks, respectively. In the former task, the model learns to recognize the relations between agents with a graph representation and to determine their relative significance. In the latter task, the model learns to capture the temporal proximity and dependency in long-term human motions. We also propose an effective double-stage training pipeline with an alternating training strategy to optimize the parameters in different modules of the framework. We validate the framework on both synthetic simulations and motion forecasting benchmarks in different domains, demonstrating that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, but also provides interpretable and reasonable hybrid attention weights.\n",
      "A skeleton representation of the human body has been proven to be effective for this task. The skeletons are presented in graphs form-like. However, the topology of a graph is not structured like Euclidean-based data. Therefore, a new set of methods to perform the convolution operation upon the skeleton graph is presented. Our proposal is based upon the ST-GCN framework proposed by Yan et al. [1]. In this study, we present an improved set of label mapping methods for the ST-GCN framework. We introduce three split processes (full distance split, connection split, and index split) as an alternative approach for the convolution operation. To evaluate the performance, the experiments presented in this study have been trained using two benchmark datasets: NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics. Our results indicate that all of our split processes outperform the previous partition strategies and are more stable during training without using the edge importance weighting additional training parameter. Therefore, our proposal can provide a more realistic solution for real-time applications centred on daily living recognition systems activities for indoor environments.\n",
      "Tracking the 6D pose of objects in video sequences is important for robot manipulation. Most prior efforts, however, often assume that the target object's CAD model, at least at a category-level, is available for offline training or during online template matching. This work proposes BundleTrack, a general framework for 6D pose tracking of novel objects, which does not depend upon 3D models, either at the instance or category-level. It leverages the complementary attributes of recent advances in deep learning for segmentation and robust feature extraction, as well as memory-augmented pose graph optimization for spatiotemporal consistency. This enables long-term, low-drift tracking under various challenging scenarios, including significant occlusions and object motions. Comprehensive experiments given two public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-art, category-level 6D tracking or dynamic SLAM methods. When compared against state-of-art methods that rely on an object instance CAD model, comparable performance is achieved, despite the proposed method's reduced information requirements. An efficient implementation in CUDA provides a real-time performance of 10Hz for the entire framework. Code is available at: https://github.com/wenbowen123/BundleTrack\n",
      "Dealing with missing values and incomplete time series is a labor-intensive and time-consuming inevitable task when handling data coming from real-world applications. Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation methods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming from sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of interconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and often strong - relational information. Notably, most of state-of-the-art imputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational aspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to adequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural networks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable tools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this work, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context of multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel graph neural network architecture, named GRIL, which aims at reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by learning spatial-temporal representations through message passing. Preliminary empirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task on relevant benchmarks with mean absolute error improvements often higher than 20%.\n",
      "Data selection methods, such as active learning and core-set selection, are useful tools for improving the data efficiency of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. However, recent deep learning models have moved forward from independent and identically distributed data to graph-structured data, such as social networks, e-commerce user-item graphs, and knowledge graphs. This evolution has led to the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that go beyond the models existing data selection methods are designed for. Therefore, we present Grain, an efficient framework that opens up a new perspective through connecting data selection in GNNs with social influence maximization. By exploiting the common patterns of GNNs, Grain introduces a novel feature propagation concept, a diversified influence maximization objective with novel influence and diversity functions, and a greedy algorithm with an approximation guarantee into a unified framework. Empirical studies on public datasets demonstrate that Grain significantly improves both the performance and efficiency of data selection (including active learning and core-set selection) for GNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to bridge two largely parallel threads of research, data selection, and social influence maximization, in the setting of GNNs, paving new ways for improving data efficiency.\n",
      "There has been a recent surge of research interest in attacking the problem of social relation inference based on images. Existing works classify social relations mainly by creating complicated graphs of human interactions, or learning the foreground and/or background information of persons and objects, but ignore holistic scene context. The holistic scene refers to the functionality of a place in images, such as dinning room, playground and office. In this paper, by mimicking human understanding on images, we propose an approach of \\textbf{PR}actical \\textbf{I}nference in \\textbf{S}ocial r\\textbf{E}lation (PRISE), which concisely learns interactive features of persons and discriminative features of holistic scenes. Technically, we develop a simple and fast relational graph convolutional network to capture interactive features of all persons in one image. To learn the holistic scene feature, we elaborately design a contrastive learning task based on image scene classification. To further boost the performance in social relation inference, we collect and distribute a new large-scale dataset, which consists of about 240 thousand unlabeled images. The extensive experimental results show that our novel learning framework significantly beats the state-of-the-art methods, e.g., PRISE achieves 6.8$\\%$ improvement for domain classification in PIPA dataset.\n",
      "Correspondence selection aims to correctly select the consistent matches (inliers) from an initial set of putative correspondences. The selection is challenging since putative matches are typically extremely unbalanced, largely dominated by outliers, and the random distribution of such outliers further complicates the learning process for learning-based methods. To address this issue, we propose to progressively prune the correspondences via a local-to-global consensus learning procedure. We introduce a ``pruning'' block that lets us identify reliable candidates among the initial matches according to consensus scores estimated using local-to-global dynamic graphs. We then achieve progressive pruning by stacking multiple pruning blocks sequentially. Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts on robust line fitting, camera pose estimation and retrieval-based image localization benchmarks by significant margins and shows promising generalization ability to different datasets and detector/descriptor combinations.\n",
      "Understanding the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks is one of the main topics in the field recently, as black-box approaches have become usual since the widespread of deep learning. Such high-dimensional models may manifest instabilities and weird properties that resemble complex systems. Therefore, we propose Complex Network (CN) techniques to analyze the structure and performance of fully connected neural networks. For that, we build a dataset with 4 thousand models and their respective CN properties. They are employed in a supervised classification setup considering four vision benchmarks. Each neural network is approached as a weighted and undirected graph of neurons and synapses, and centrality measures are computed after training. Results show that these measures are highly related to the network classification performance. We also propose the concept of Bag-Of-Neurons (BoN), a CN-based approach for finding topological signatures linking similar neurons. Results suggest that six neuronal types emerge in such networks, independently of the target domain, and are distributed differently according to classification accuracy. We also tackle specific CN properties related to performance, such as higher subgraph centrality on lower-performing models. Our findings suggest that CN properties play a critical role in the performance of fully connected neural networks, with topological patterns emerging independently on a wide range of models.\n",
      "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is one of the richest openly available sources of volunteered geographic information. Although OSM includes various geographical entities, their descriptions are highly heterogeneous, incomplete, and do not follow any well-defined ontology. Knowledge graphs can potentially provide valuable semantic information to enrich OSM entities. However, interlinking OSM entities with knowledge graphs is inherently difficult due to the large, heterogeneous, ambiguous, and flat OSM schema and the annotation sparsity. This paper tackles the alignment of OSM tags with the corresponding knowledge graph classes holistically by jointly considering the schema and instance layers. We propose a novel neural architecture that capitalizes upon a shared latent space for tag-to-class alignment created using linked entities in OSM and knowledge graphs. Our experiments performed to align OSM datasets for several countries with two of the most prominent openly available knowledge graphs, namely, Wikidata and DBpedia, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art schema alignment baselines by up to 53 percentage points in terms of F1-score. The resulting alignment facilitates new semantic annotations for over 10 million OSM entities worldwide, which is more than a 400% increase compared to the existing semantic annotations in OSM.\n",
      "Recent years have seen a surge in research on deep interpretable neural networks with decision trees as one of the most commonly incorporated tools. There are at least three advantages of using decision trees over logistic regression classification models: they are easy to interpret since they are based on binary decisions, they can make decisions faster, and they provide a hierarchy of classes. However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision trees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the decision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep learning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov processes, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision graphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG). We provide an extensive theoretical study of SONG, complemented by experiments conducted on Letter, Connect4, MNIST, CIFAR, and TinyImageNet datasets, showing that our method performs on par or better than existing decision models.\n",
      "Many available formal verification methods have been shown to be instances of a unified Branch-and-Bound (BaB) formulation. We propose a novel machine learning framework that can be used for designing an effective branching strategy as well as for computing better lower bounds. Specifically, we learn two graph neural networks (GNN) that both directly treat the network we want to verify as a graph input and perform forward-backward passes through the GNN layers. We use one GNN to simulate the strong branching heuristic behaviour and another to compute a feasible dual solution of the convex relaxation, thereby providing a valid lower bound.   We provide a new verification dataset that is more challenging than those used in the literature, thereby providing an effective alternative for testing algorithmic improvements for verification. Whilst using just one of the GNNs leads to a reduction in verification time, we get optimal performance when combining the two GNN approaches. Our combined framework achieves a 50\\% reduction in both the number of branches and the time required for verification on various convolutional networks when compared to several state-of-the-art verification methods. In addition, we show that our GNN models generalize well to harder properties on larger unseen networks.\n",
      "The performance of spectral clustering heavily relies on the quality of affinity matrix. A variety of affinity-matrix-construction methods have been proposed but they have hyper-parameters to determine beforehand, which requires strong experience and lead to difficulty in real applications especially when the inter-cluster similarity is high or/and the dataset is large. On the other hand, we often have to determine to use a linear model or a nonlinear model, which still depends on experience. To solve these two problems, in this paper, we present an eigen-gap guided search method for subspace clustering. The main idea is to find the most reliable affinity matrix among a set of candidates constructed by linear and kernel regressions, where the reliability is quantified by the \\textit{relative-eigen-gap} of graph Laplacian defined in this paper. We show, theoretically and numerically, that the Laplacian matrix with a larger relative-eigen-gap often yields a higher clustering accuracy and stability. Our method is able to automatically search the best model and hyper-parameters in a pre-defined space. The search space is very easy to determine and can be arbitrarily large, though a relatively compact search space can reduce the highly unnecessary computation. Our method has high flexibility and convenience in real applications, and also has low computational cost because the affinity matrix is not computed by iterative optimization. We extend the method to large-scale datasets such as MNIST, on which the time cost is less than 90s and the clustering accuracy is state-of-the-art. Extensive experiments of natural image clustering show that our method is more stable, accurate, and efficient than baseline methods.\n",
      "We focus on reinforcement learning (RL) in relational problems that are naturally defined in terms of objects, their relations, and manipulations. These problems are characterized by variable state and action spaces, and finding a fixed-length representation, required by most existing RL methods, is difficult, if not impossible. We present a deep RL framework based on graph neural networks and auto-regressive policy decomposition that naturally works with these problems and is completely domain-independent. We demonstrate the framework in three very distinct domains and we report the method's competitive performance and impressive zero-shot generalization over different problem sizes. In goal-oriented BlockWorld, we demonstrate multi-parameter actions with pre-conditions. In SysAdmin, we show how to select multiple objects simultaneously. In the classical planning domain of Sokoban, the method trained exclusively on 10x10 problems with three boxes solves 89% of 15x15 problems with five boxes.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in many graph-based tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. However, GNNs gain their performance benefits mainly from performing the feature propagation and smoothing across the edges of the graph, thus requiring sufficient connectivity and label information for effective propagation. Unfortunately, many real-world networks are sparse in terms of both edges and labels, leading to sub-optimal performance of GNNs. Recent interest in this sparse problem has focused on the self-training approach, which expands supervised signals with pseudo labels. Nevertheless, the self-training approach inherently cannot realize the full potential of refining the learning performance on sparse graphs due to the unsatisfactory quality and quantity of pseudo labels.   In this paper, we propose ROD, a novel reception-aware online knowledge distillation approach for sparse graph learning. We design three supervision signals for ROD: multi-scale reception-aware graph knowledge, task-based supervision, and rich distilled knowledge, allowing online knowledge transfer in a peer-teaching manner. To extract knowledge concealed in the multi-scale reception fields, ROD explicitly requires individual student models to preserve different levels of locality information. For a given task, each student would predict based on its reception-scale knowledge, while simultaneously a strong teacher is established on-the-fly by combining multi-scale knowledge. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on 9 datasets and a variety of graph-based tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. The result demonstrates that ROD achieves state-of-art performance and is more robust for the graph sparsity.\n",
      "The rapid evolution of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has led to a growing number of new architectures as well as novel applications. However, current research focuses on proposing and evaluating specific architectural designs of GNNs, as opposed to studying the more general design space of GNNs that consists of a Cartesian product of different design dimensions, such as the number of layers or the type of the aggregation function. Additionally, GNN designs are often specialized to a single task, yet few efforts have been made to understand how to quickly find the best GNN design for a novel task or a novel dataset. Here we define and systematically study the architectural design space for GNNs which consists of 315,000 different designs over 32 different predictive tasks. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) A general GNN design space; (2) a GNN task space with a similarity metric, so that for a given novel task/dataset, we can quickly identify/transfer the best performing architecture; (3) an efficient and effective design space evaluation method which allows insights to be distilled from a huge number of model-task combinations. Our key results include: (1) A comprehensive set of guidelines for designing well-performing GNNs; (2) while best GNN designs for different tasks vary significantly, the GNN task space allows for transferring the best designs across different tasks; (3) models discovered using our design space achieve state-of-the-art performance. Overall, our work offers a principled and scalable approach to transition from studying individual GNN designs for specific tasks, to systematically studying the GNN design space and the task space. Finally, we release GraphGym, a powerful platform for exploring different GNN designs and tasks. GraphGym features modularized GNN implementation, standardized GNN evaluation, and reproducible and scalable experiment management.\n",
      "Federated learning has emerged as an important paradigm for training machine learning models in different domains. For graph-level tasks such as graph classification, graphs can also be regarded as a special type of data samples, which can be collected and stored in separate local systems. Similar to other domains, multiple local systems, each holding a small set of graphs, may benefit from collaboratively training a powerful graph mining model, such as the popular graph neural networks (GNNs). To provide more motivation towards such endeavors, we analyze real-world graphs from different domains to confirm that they indeed share certain graph properties that are statistically significant compared with random graphs. However, we also find that different sets of graphs, even from the same domain or same dataset, are non-IID regarding both graph structures and node features. To handle this, we propose a graph clustered federated learning (GCFL) framework that dynamically finds clusters of local systems based on the gradients of GNNs, and theoretically justify that such clusters can reduce the structure and feature heterogeneity among graphs owned by the local systems. Moreover, we observe the gradients of GNNs to be rather fluctuating in GCFL which impedes high-quality clustering, and design a gradient sequence-based clustering mechanism based on dynamic time warping (GCFL+). Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks.\n",
      "Skyline plays a pivotal role in mountainous visual geo-localization and localization/navigation of planetary rovers/UAVs and virtual/augmented reality applications. We present a novel mountainous skyline detection approach where we adapt a shallow learning approach to learn a set of filters to discriminate between edges belonging to sky-mountain boundary and others coming from different regions. Unlike earlier approaches, which either rely on extraction of explicit feature descriptors and their classification, or fine-tuning general scene parsing deep networks for sky segmentation, our approach learns linear filters based on local structure analysis. At test time, for every candidate edge pixel, a single filter is chosen from the set of learned filters based on pixel's structure tensor, and then applied to the patch around it. We then employ dynamic programming to solve the shortest path problem for the resultant multistage graph to get the sky-mountain boundary. The proposed approach is computationally faster than earlier methods while providing comparable performance and is more suitable for resource constrained platforms e.g., mobile devices, planetary rovers and UAVs. We compare our proposed approach against earlier skyline detection methods using four different data sets. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/TouqeerAhmad/skyline_detection}.\n",
      "Causal discovery from observational data is a challenging task to which an exact solution cannot always be identified. Under assumptions about the data-generative process, the causal graph can often be identified up to an equivalence class. Proposing new realistic assumptions to circumscribe such equivalence classes is an active field of research. In this work, we propose a new set of assumptions that constrain possible causal relationships based on the nature of the variables. We thus introduce typed directed acyclic graphs, in which variable types are used to determine the validity of causal relationships. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed assumptions can result in significant gains in the identification of the causal graph.\n",
      "Learning the structure of a causal graphical model using both observational and interventional data is a fundamental problem in many scientific fields. A promising direction is continuous optimization for score-based methods, which efficiently learn the causal graph in a data-driven manner. However, to date, those methods require constrained optimization to enforce acyclicity or lack convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present ENCO, an efficient structure learning method for directed, acyclic causal graphs leveraging observational and interventional data. ENCO formulates the graph search as an optimization of independent edge likelihoods, with the edge orientation being modeled as a separate parameter. Consequently, we can provide convergence guarantees of ENCO under mild conditions without constraining the score function with respect to acyclicity. In experiments, we show that ENCO can efficiently recover graphs with hundreds of nodes, an order of magnitude larger than what was previously possible, while handling deterministic variables and latent confounders.\n",
      "Embedding static graphs in low-dimensional vector spaces plays a key role in network analytics and inference, supporting applications like node classification, link prediction, and graph visualization. However, many real-world networks present dynamic behavior, including topological evolution, feature evolution, and diffusion. Therefore, several methods for embedding dynamic graphs have been proposed to learn network representations over time, facing novel challenges, such as time-domain modeling, temporal features to be captured, and the temporal granularity to be embedded. In this survey, we overview dynamic graph embedding, discussing its fundamentals and the recent advances developed so far. We introduce the formal definition of dynamic graph embedding, focusing on the problem setting and introducing a novel taxonomy for dynamic graph embedding input and output. We further explore different dynamic behaviors that may be encompassed by embeddings, classifying by topological evolution, feature evolution, and processes on networks. Afterward, we describe existing techniques and propose a taxonomy for dynamic graph embedding techniques based on algorithmic approaches, from matrix and tensor factorization to deep learning, random walks, and temporal point processes. We also elucidate main applications, including dynamic link prediction, anomaly detection, and diffusion prediction, and we further state some promising research directions in the area.\n",
      "Graph structural information such as topologies or connectivities provides valuable guidance for graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn nodes' representations. Existing GCN models that capture nodes' structural information weight in- and out-neighbors equally or differentiate in- and out-neighbors globally without considering nodes' local topologies. We observe that in- and out-neighbors contribute differently for nodes with different local topologies. To explore the directional structural information for different nodes, we propose a GCN model with weighted structural features, named WGCN. WGCN first captures nodes' structural fingerprints via a direction and degree aware Random Walk with Restart algorithm, where the walk is guided by both edge direction and nodes' in- and out-degrees. Then, the interactions between nodes' structural fingerprints are used as the weighted node structural features. To further capture nodes' high-order dependencies and graph geometry, WGCN embeds graphs into a latent space to obtain nodes' latent neighbors and geometrical relationships. Based on nodes' geometrical relationships in the latent space, WGCN differentiates latent, in-, and out-neighbors with an attention-based geometrical aggregation. Experiments on transductive node classification tasks show that WGCN outperforms the baseline models consistently by up to 17.07% in terms of accuracy on five benchmark datasets.\n",
      "Playing board games is considered a major challenge for both humans and AI researchers. Because some complicated board games are quite hard to learn, humans usually begin with playing on smaller boards and incrementally advance to master larger board strategies. Most neural network frameworks that are currently tasked with playing board games neither perform such incremental learning nor possess capabilities to automatically scale up. In this work, we look at the board as a graph and combine a graph neural network architecture inside the AlphaZero framework, along with some other innovative improvements. Our ScalableAlphaZero is capable of learning to play incrementally on small boards, and advancing to play on large ones. Our model can be trained quickly to play different challenging board games on multiple board sizes, without using any domain knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ScalableAlphaZero and show, for example, that by training it for only three days on small Othello boards, it can defeat the AlphaZero model on a large board, which was trained to play the large board for $30$ days.\n",
      "Massive deployment of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in high-stake applications generates a strong demand for explanations that are robust to noise and align well with human intuition. Most existing methods generate explanations by identifying a subgraph of an input graph that has a strong correlation with the prediction. These explanations are not robust to noise because independently optimizing the correlation for a single input can easily overfit noise. Moreover, they do not align well with human intuition because removing an identified subgraph from an input graph does not necessarily change the prediction result. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate robust counterfactual explanations on GNNs by explicitly modelling the common decision logic of GNNs on similar input graphs. Our explanations are naturally robust to noise because they are produced from the common decision boundaries of a GNN that govern the predictions of many similar input graphs. The explanations also align well with human intuition because removing the set of edges identified by an explanation from the input graph changes the prediction significantly. Exhaustive experiments on many public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method.\n",
      "We convert the DeepMind Mathematics Dataset into a reinforcement learning environment by interpreting it as a program synthesis problem. Each action taken in the environment adds an operator or an input into a discrete compute graph. Graphs which compute correct answers yield positive reward, enabling the optimization of a policy to construct compute graphs conditioned on problem statements. Baseline models are trained using Double DQN on various subsets of problem types, demonstrating the capability to learn to correctly construct graphs despite the challenges of combinatorial explosion and noisy rewards.\n",
      "Consider multiple experts with overlapping expertise working on a classification problem under uncertain input. What constitutes a consistent set of opinions? How can we predict the opinions of experts on missing sub-domains? In this paper, we define a framework of to analyze this problem, termed \"expert graphs.\" In an expert graph, vertices represent classes and edges represent binary opinions on the topics of their vertices. We derive necessary conditions for expert graph validity and use them to create \"synthetic experts\" which describe opinions consistent with the observed opinions of other experts. We show this framework to be equivalent to the well-studied linear ordering polytope. We show our conditions are not sufficient for describing all expert graphs on cliques, but are sufficient for cycles.\n",
      "The spread of COVID-19 has coincided with the rise of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), leading to several studies proposing their use to better forecast the evolution of the pandemic. Many such models also include Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a common tool for time series forecasting. In this work, we further investigate the integration of these two methods by implementing GNNs within the gates of an LSTM and exploiting spatial information. In addition, we introduce a skip connection which proves critical to jointly capture the spatial and temporal patterns in the data. We validate our daily COVID-19 new cases forecast model on data of 37 European nations for the last 472 days and show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art graph time series models based on mean absolute scaled error (MASE). This area of research has important applications to policy-making and we analyze its potential for pandemic resource control.\n",
      "Locating diseases in chest X-ray images with few careful annotations saves large human effort. Recent works approached this task with innovative weakly-supervised algorithms such as multi-instance learning (MIL) and class activation maps (CAM), however, these methods often yield inaccurate or incomplete regions. One of the reasons is the neglection of the pathological implications hidden in the relationship across anatomical regions within each image and the relationship across images. In this paper, we argue that the cross-region and cross-image relationship, as contextual and compensating information, is vital to obtain more consistent and integral regions. To model the relationship, we propose the Graph Regularized Embedding Network (GREN), which leverages the intra-image and inter-image information to locate diseases on chest X-ray images. GREN uses a pre-trained U-Net to segment the lung lobes, and then models the intra-image relationship between the lung lobes using an intra-image graph to compare different regions. Meanwhile, the relationship between in-batch images is modeled by an inter-image graph to compare multiple images. This process mimics the training and decision-making process of a radiologist: comparing multiple regions and images for diagnosis. In order for the deep embedding layers of the neural network to retain structural information (important in the localization task), we use the Hash coding and Hamming distance to compute the graphs, which are used as regularizers to facilitate training. By means of this, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art result on NIH chest X-ray dataset for weakly-supervised disease localization. Our codes are accessible online.\n",
      "Deep learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This perception led to analyzing deep learning models not only from the perspective of their performance measures but also their robustness to certain types of adversarial attacks. We take another step forward in relating the architectural structure of neural networks from a graph theoretic perspective to their robustness. We aim to investigate any existing correlations between graph theoretic properties and the robustness of Sparse Neural Networks. Our hypothesis is, that graph theoretic properties as a prior of neural network structures are related to their robustness. To answer to this hypothesis, we designed an empirical study with neural network models obtained through random graphs used as sparse structural priors for the networks. We additionally investigated the evaluation of a randomly pruned fully connected network as a point of reference.   We found that robustness measures are independent of initialization methods but show weak correlations with graph properties: higher graph densities correlate with lower robustness, but higher average path lengths and average node eccentricities show negative correlations with robustness measures. We hope to motivate further empirical and analytical research to tightening an answer to our hypothesis.\n",
      "The Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) proposed by Kipf and Welling are effective models for semi-supervised learning, but facing the obstacle of over-smoothing, which will weaken the representation ability of GCNs. Recently some works are proposed to tackle with above limitation by randomly perturbing graph topology or feature matrix to generate data augmentations as input for training. However, these operations have to pay the price of information structure integrity breaking, and inevitably sacrifice information stochastically from original graph. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph entropy definition as an quantitative index to evaluate feature information diffusion among a graph. Under considerations of preserving graph entropy, we propose an effective strategy to generate perturbed training data using a stochastic mechanism but guaranteeing graph topology integrity and with only a small amount of graph entropy decaying. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets and the results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method in improving semi-supervised node classification accuracy compared with a surge of baselines. Beyond that, our proposed approach significantly enhances the robustness and generalization ability of GCNs during the training process.\n",
      "In recent years, the fast rise in number of studies on graph neural network (GNN) has put it from the theories research to reality application stage. Despite the encouraging performance achieved by GNN, less attention has been paid to the privacy-preserving training and inference over distributed graph data in the related literature. Due to the particularity of graph structure, it is challenging to extend the existing private learning framework to GNN. Motivated by the idea of split learning, we propose a \\textbf{S}erver \\textbf{A}ided \\textbf{P}rivacy-preserving \\textbf{GNN} (SAPGNN) for the node level task on horizontally partitioned cross-silo scenario. It offers a natural extension of centralized GNN to isolated graph with max/min pooling aggregation, while guaranteeing that all the private data involved in computation still stays at local data holders. To further enhancing the data privacy, a secure pooling aggregation mechanism is proposed. Theoretical and experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the same accuracy as the one learned over the combined data.\n",
      "Micro-expression recognition (\\textbf{MER}) has attracted lots of researchers' attention in a decade. However, occlusion will occur for MER in real-world scenarios. This paper deeply investigates an interesting but unexplored challenging issue in MER, \\ie, occlusion MER. First, to research MER under real-world occlusion, synthetic occluded micro-expression databases are created by using various mask for the community. Second, to suppress the influence of occlusion, a \\underline{R}egion-inspired \\underline{R}elation \\underline{R}easoning \\underline{N}etwork (\\textbf{RRRN}) is proposed to model relations between various facial regions. RRRN consists of a backbone network, the Region-Inspired (\\textbf{RI}) module and Relation Reasoning (\\textbf{RR}) module. More specifically, the backbone network aims at extracting feature representations from different facial regions, RI module computing an adaptive weight from the region itself based on attention mechanism with respect to the unobstructedness and importance for suppressing the influence of occlusion, and RR module exploiting the progressive interactions among these regions by performing graph convolutions. Experiments are conducted on handout-database evaluation and composite database evaluation tasks of MEGC 2018 protocol. Experimental results show that RRRN can significantly explore the importance of facial regions and capture the cooperative complementary relationship of facial regions for MER. The results also demonstrate RRRN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, especially on occlusion, and RRRN acts more robust to occlusion.\n",
      "The Laplacian representation recently gains increasing attention for reinforcement learning as it provides succinct and informative representation for states, by taking the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of the state-transition graph as state embeddings. Such representation captures the geometry of the underlying state space and is beneficial to RL tasks such as option discovery and reward shaping. To approximate the Laplacian representation in large (or even continuous) state spaces, recent works propose to minimize a spectral graph drawing objective, which however has infinitely many global minimizers other than the eigenvectors. As a result, their learned Laplacian representation may differ from the ground truth. To solve this problem, we reformulate the graph drawing objective into a generalized form and derive a new learning objective, which is proved to have eigenvectors as its unique global minimizer. It enables learning high-quality Laplacian representations that faithfully approximate the ground truth. We validate this via comprehensive experiments on a set of gridworld and continuous control environments. Moreover, we show that our learned Laplacian representations lead to more exploratory options and better reward shaping.\n",
      "Causal discovery from observational data is an important tool in many branches of science. Under certain assumptions it allows scientists to explain phenomena, predict, and make decisions. In the large sample limit, sound and complete causal discovery algorithms have been previously introduced, where a directed acyclic graph (DAG), or its equivalence class, representing causal relations is searched. However, in real-world cases, only finite training data is available, which limits the power of statistical tests used by these algorithms, leading to errors in the inferred causal model. This is commonly addressed by devising a strategy for using as few as possible statistical tests. In this paper, we introduce such a strategy in the form of a recursive wrapper for existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms, which preserves soundness and completeness. It recursively clusters the observed variables using the normalized min-cut criterion from the outset, and uses a baseline causal discovery algorithm during backtracking for learning local sub-graphs. It then combines them and ensures completeness. By an ablation study, using synthetic data, and by common real-world benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach requires significantly fewer statistical tests, learns more accurate graphs, and requires shorter run-times than the baseline algorithm.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a generalization of deep neural networks on graph data have been widely used in various domains, ranging from drug discovery to recommender systems. However, GNNs on such applications are limited when there are few available samples. Meta-learning has been an important framework to address the lack of samples in machine learning, and in recent years, researchers have started to apply meta-learning to GNNs. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey of different meta-learning approaches involving GNNs on various graph problems showing the power of using these two approaches together. We categorize the literature based on proposed architectures, shared representations, and applications. Finally, we discuss several exciting future research directions and open problems.\n",
      "Active learning is widely used to reduce labeling effort and training time by repeatedly querying only the most beneficial samples from unlabeled data. In real-world problems where data cannot be stored indefinitely due to limited storage or privacy issues, the query selection and the model update should be performed as soon as a new data sample is observed. Various online active learning methods have been studied to deal with these challenges; however, there are difficulties in selecting representative query samples and updating the model efficiently without forgetting. In this study, we propose Message Passing Adaptive Resonance Theory (MPART) that learns the distribution and topology of input data online. Through message passing on the topological graph, MPART actively queries informative and representative samples, and continuously improves the classification performance using both labeled and unlabeled data. We evaluate our model in stream-based selective sampling scenarios with comparable query selection strategies, showing that MPART significantly outperforms competitive models.\n",
      "Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial samples, the detection of which is crucial for the wide application of these DNN models. Recently, a number of deep testing methods in software engineering were proposed to find the vulnerability of DNN systems, and one of them, i.e., Model Mutation Testing (MMT), was used to successfully detect various adversarial samples generated by different kinds of adversarial attacks. However, the mutated models in MMT are always huge in number (e.g., over 100 models) and lack diversity (e.g., can be easily circumvented by high-confidence adversarial samples), which makes it less efficient in real applications and less effective in detecting high-confidence adversarial samples. In this study, we propose Graph-Guided Testing (GGT) for adversarial sample detection to overcome these aforementioned challenges. GGT generates pruned models with the guide of graph characteristics, each of them has only about 5% parameters of the mutated model in MMT, and graph guided models have higher diversity. The experiments on CIFAR10 and SVHN validate that GGT performs much better than MMT with respect to both effectiveness and efficiency.\n",
      "Gaussian processes with derivative information are useful in many settings where derivative information is available, including numerous Bayesian optimization and regression tasks that arise in the natural sciences. Incorporating derivative observations, however, comes with a dominating $O(N^3D^3)$ computational cost when training on $N$ points in $D$ input dimensions. This is intractable for even moderately sized problems. While recent work has addressed this intractability in the low-$D$ setting, the high-$N$, high-$D$ setting is still unexplored and of great value, particularly as machine learning problems increasingly become high dimensional. In this paper, we introduce methods to achieve fully scalable Gaussian process regression with derivatives using variational inference. Analogous to the use of inducing values to sparsify the labels of a training set, we introduce the concept of inducing directional derivatives to sparsify the partial derivative information of a training set. This enables us to construct a variational posterior that incorporates derivative information but whose size depends neither on the full dataset size $N$ nor the full dimensionality $D$. We demonstrate the full scalability of our approach on a variety of tasks, ranging from a high dimensional stellarator fusion regression task to training graph convolutional neural networks on Pubmed using Bayesian optimization. Surprisingly, we find that our approach can improve regression performance even in settings where only label data is available.\n",
      "Attributed event sequences are commonly encountered in practice. A recent research line focuses on incorporating neural networks with the statistical model -- marked point processes, which is the conventional tool for dealing with attributed event sequences. Neural marked point processes possess good interpretability of probabilistic models as well as the representational power of neural networks. However, we find that performance of neural marked point processes is not always increasing as the network architecture becomes more complicated and larger, which is what we call the performance saturation phenomenon. This is due to the fact that the generalization error of neural marked point processes is determined by both the network representational ability and the model specification at the same time. Therefore we can draw two major conclusions: first, simple network structures can perform no worse than complicated ones for some cases; second, using a proper probabilistic assumption is as equally, if not more, important as improving the complexity of the network. Based on this observation, we propose a simple graph-based network structure called GCHP, which utilizes only graph convolutional layers, thus it can be easily accelerated by the parallel mechanism. We directly consider the distribution of interarrival times instead of imposing a specific assumption on the conditional intensity function, and propose to use a likelihood ratio loss with a moment matching mechanism for optimization and model selection. Experimental results show that GCHP can significantly reduce training time and the likelihood ratio loss with interarrival time probability assumptions can greatly improve the model performance.\n",
      "This paper proposes the Mesh Neural Network (MNN), a novel architecture which allows neurons to be connected in any topology, to efficiently route information. In MNNs, information is propagated between neurons throughout a state transition function. State and error gradients are then directly computed from state updates without backward computation. The MNN architecture and the error propagation schema is formalized and derived in tensor algebra. The proposed computational model can fully supply a gradient descent process, and is potentially suitable for very large scale sparse NNs, due to its expressivity and training efficiency, with respect to NNs based on back-propagation and computational graphs.\n",
      "In many real-world problems, we want to infer some property of an expensive black-box function $f$, given a budget of $T$ function evaluations. One example is budget constrained global optimization of $f$, for which Bayesian optimization is a popular method. Other properties of interest include local optima, level sets, integrals, or graph-structured information induced by $f$. Often, we can find an algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ to compute the desired property, but it may require far more than $T$ queries to execute. Given such an $\\mathcal{A}$, and a prior distribution over $f$, we refer to the problem of inferring the output of $\\mathcal{A}$ using $T$ evaluations as Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX). To tackle this problem, we present a procedure, InfoBAX, that sequentially chooses queries that maximize mutual information with respect to the algorithm's output. Applying this to Dijkstra's algorithm, for instance, we infer shortest paths in synthetic and real-world graphs with black-box edge costs. Using evolution strategies, we yield variants of Bayesian optimization that target local, rather than global, optima. On these problems, InfoBAX uses up to 500 times fewer queries to $f$ than required by the original algorithm. Our method is closely connected to other Bayesian optimal experimental design procedures such as entropy search methods and optimal sensor placement using Gaussian processes.\n",
      "We study the problem of determining the best intervention in a Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) specified only by its causal graph. We model this as a stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with side-information, where the interventions correspond to the arms of the bandit instance. First, we propose a simple regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a semi-Markovian causal graph with atomic interventions and possibly unobservable variables, and achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{M/T})$ expected simple regret, where $M$ is dependent on the input CBN and could be very small compared to the number of arms. We also show that this is almost optimal for CBNs described by causal graphs having an $n$-ary tree structure. Our simple regret minimization results, both upper and lower bound, subsume previous results in the literature, which assumed additional structural restrictions on the input causal graph. In particular, our results indicate that the simple regret guarantee of our proposed algorithm can only be improved by considering more nuanced structural restrictions on the causal graph. Next, we propose a cumulative regret minimization algorithm that takes as input a general causal graph with all observable nodes and atomic interventions and performs better than the optimal MAB algorithm that does not take causal side-information into account. We also experimentally compare both our algorithms with the best known algorithms in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work gives the first simple and cumulative regret minimization algorithms for CBNs with general causal graphs under atomic interventions and having unobserved confounders.\n",
      "Over the past few years, graph neural networks (GNN) and label propagation-based methods have made significant progress in addressing node classification tasks on graphs. However, in addition to their reliance on elaborate architectures and algorithms, there are several key technical details that are frequently overlooked, and yet nonetheless can play a vital role in achieving satisfactory performance. In this paper, we first summarize a series of existing tricks-of-the-trade, and then propose several new ones related to label usage, loss function formulation, and model design that can significantly improve various GNN architectures. We empirically evaluate their impact on final node classification accuracy by conducting ablation studies and demonstrate consistently-improved performance, often to an extent that outweighs the gains from more dramatic changes in the underlying GNN architecture. Notably, many of the top-ranked models on the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) leaderboard and KDDCUP 2021 Large-Scale Challenge MAG240M-LSC benefit from these techniques.\n",
      "Person re-identification via 3D skeletons is an emerging topic with great potential in security-critical applications. Existing methods typically learn body and motion features from the body-joint trajectory, whereas they lack a systematic way to model body structure and underlying relations of body components beyond the scale of body joints. In this paper, we for the first time propose a Self-supervised Multi-scale Skeleton Graph Encoding (SM-SGE) framework that comprehensively models human body, component relations, and skeleton dynamics from unlabeled skeleton graphs of various scales to learn an effective skeleton representation for person Re-ID. Specifically, we first devise multi-scale skeleton graphs with coarse-to-fine human body partitions, which enables us to model body structure and skeleton dynamics at multiple levels. Second, to mine inherent correlations between body components in skeletal motion, we propose a multi-scale graph relation network to learn structural relations between adjacent body-component nodes and collaborative relations among nodes of different scales, so as to capture more discriminative skeleton graph features. Last, we propose a novel multi-scale skeleton reconstruction mechanism to enable our framework to encode skeleton dynamics and high-level semantics from unlabeled skeleton graphs, which encourages learning a discriminative skeleton representation for person Re-ID. Extensive experiments show that SM-SGE outperforms most state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness on 3D skeleton data estimated from large-scale RGB videos. Our codes are open at https://github.com/Kali-Hac/SM-SGE.\n",
      "While many existing graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proven to perform $\\ell_2$-based graph smoothing that enforces smoothness globally, in this work we aim to further enhance the local smoothness adaptivity of GNNs via $\\ell_1$-based graph smoothing. As a result, we introduce a family of GNNs (Elastic GNNs) based on $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$-based graph smoothing. In particular, we propose a novel and general message passing scheme into GNNs. This message passing algorithm is not only friendly to back-propagation training but also achieves the desired smoothing properties with a theoretical convergence guarantee. Experiments on semi-supervised learning tasks demonstrate that the proposed Elastic GNNs obtain better adaptivity on benchmark datasets and are significantly robust to graph adversarial attacks. The implementation of Elastic GNNs is available at \\url{https://github.com/lxiaorui/ElasticGNN}.\n",
      "Understanding and representing traffic patterns are key to detecting anomalies in the maritime domain. To this end, we propose a novel graph-based traffic representation and association scheme to cluster trajectories of vessels using automatic identification system (AIS) data. We utilize the (un)clustered data to train a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based evidential regression model, which can predict a vessel's trajectory at future timesteps with its corresponding prediction uncertainty. This paper proposes the usage of a deep learning (DL)-based uncertainty estimation in detecting maritime anomalies, such as unusual vessel maneuvering. Furthermore, we utilize the evidential deep learning classifiers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of AIS signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that using graph-based clustered data improves the ability of the DL models to learn the temporal-spatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties. Using different AIS datasets and experiments, we demonstrate that the estimated prediction uncertainty yields fundamental information for the detection of traffic anomalies in the maritime and, possibly in other domains.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various graph-related problems such as node classification and graph classification, where the superior performance is mainly established when natural node features are available. However, it is not well understood how GNNs work without natural node features, especially regarding the various ways to construct artificial ones. In this paper, we point out the two types of artificial node features,i.e., positional and structural node features, and provide insights on why each of them is more appropriate for certain tasks,i.e., positional node classification, structural node classification, and graph classification. Extensive experimental results on 10 benchmark datasets validate our insights, thus leading to a practical guideline on the choices between different artificial node features for GNNs on non-attributed graphs. The code is available at https://github.com/zjzijielu/gnn-exp/.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a novel pooling layer for graph neural networks based on maximizing the mutual information between the pooled graph and the input graph. Since the maximum mutual information is difficult to compute, we employ the Shannon capacity of a graph as an inductive bias to our pooling method. More precisely, we show that the input graph to the pooling layer can be viewed as a representation of a noisy communication channel. For such a channel, sending the symbols belonging to an independent set of the graph yields a reliable and error-free transmission of information. We show that reaching the maximum mutual information is equivalent to finding a maximum weight independent set of the graph where the weights convey entropy contents. Through this communication theoretic standpoint, we provide a distinct perspective for posing the problem of graph pooling as maximizing the information transmission rate across a noisy communication channel, implemented by a graph neural network. We evaluate our method, referred to as Maximum Entropy Weighted Independent Set Pooling (MEWISPool), on graph classification tasks and the combinatorial optimization problem of the maximum independent set. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art and competitive results on graph classification tasks and the maximum independent set problem in several benchmark datasets.\n",
      "We demonstrate how graph neural networks can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Our approach is broadly applicable to canonical NP-hard problems in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, such as maximum cut, minimum vertex cover, maximum independent set, as well as Ising spin glasses and higher-order generalizations thereof in the form of polynomial unconstrained binary optimization problems. We apply a relaxation strategy to the problem Hamiltonian to generate a differentiable loss function with which we train the graph neural network and apply a simple projection to integer variables once the unsupervised training process has completed. We showcase our approach with numerical results for the canonical maximum cut and maximum independent set problems. We find that the graph neural network optimizer performs on par or outperforms existing solvers, with the ability to scale beyond the state of the art to problems with millions of variables.\n",
      "The graph convolutional network (GCN) is a go-to solution for machine learning on graphs, but its training is notoriously difficult to scale both in terms of graph size and the number of model parameters. Although some work has explored training on large-scale graphs (e.g., GraphSAGE, ClusterGCN, etc.), we pioneer efficient training of large-scale GCN models (i.e., ultra-wide, overparameterized models) with the proposal of a novel, distributed training framework. Our proposed training methodology, called GIST, disjointly partitions the parameters of a GCN model into several, smaller sub-GCNs that are trained independently and in parallel. In addition to being compatible with any GCN architecture, GIST improves model performance, scales to training on arbitrarily large graphs, significantly decreases wall-clock training time, and enables the training of markedly overparameterized GCN models. Remarkably, with GIST, we train an astonishgly-wide 32,768-dimensional GraphSAGE model, which exceeds the capacity of a single GPU by a factor of 8X, to SOTA performance on the Amazon2M dataset.\n",
      "Factorization machine (FM) is a prevalent approach to modeling pairwise (second-order) feature interactions when dealing with high-dimensional sparse data. However, on the one hand, FM fails to capture higher-order feature interactions suffering from combinatorial expansion, on the other hand, taking into account interaction between every pair of features may introduce noise and degrade prediction accuracy. To solve the problems, we propose a novel approach Graph Factorization Machine (GraphFM) by naturally representing features in the graph structure. In particular, a novel mechanism is designed to select the beneficial feature interactions and formulate them as edges between features. Then our proposed model which integrates the interaction function of FM into the feature aggregation strategy of Graph Neural Network (GNN), can model arbitrary-order feature interactions on the graph-structured features by stacking layers. Experimental results on several real-world datasets has demonstrated the rationality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n",
      "Motivated by graph theory, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are traditionally structured as layers of neurons (nodes), which learn useful information by the passage of data through interconnections (edges). In the machine learning realm, graph structures (i.e., neurons and connections) of ANNs have recently been explored using various graph-theoretic measures linked to their predictive performance. On the other hand, in network science (NetSci), certain graph measures including entropy and curvature are known to provide insight into the robustness and fragility of real-world networks. In this work, we use these graph measures to explore the robustness of various ANNs to adversarial attacks. To this end, we (1) explore the design space of inter-layer and intra-layers connectivity regimes of ANNs in the graph domain and record their predictive performance after training under different types of adversarial attacks, (2) use graph representations for both inter-layer and intra-layers connectivity regimes to calculate various graph-theoretic measures, including curvature and entropy, and (3) analyze the relationship between these graph measures and the adversarial performance of ANNs. We show that curvature and entropy, while operating in the graph domain, can quantify the robustness of ANNs without having to train these ANNs. Our results suggest that the real-world networks, including brain networks, financial networks, and social networks may provide important clues to the neural architecture search for robust ANNs. We propose a search strategy that efficiently finds robust ANNs amongst a set of well-performing ANNs without having a need to train all of these ANNs.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require a relatively large number of labeled nodes and a reliable/uncorrupted graph connectivity structure in order to obtain good performance on the semi-supervised node classification task. The performance of GNNs can degrade significantly as the number of labeled nodes decreases or the graph connectivity structure is corrupted by adversarial attacks or due to noises in data measurement /collection. Therefore, it is important to develop GNN models that are able to achieve good performance when there is limited supervision knowledge -- a few labeled nodes and noisy graph structures. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual GNN learning framework to address this challenge task. The proposed framework has two GNN based node prediction modules. The primary module uses the input graph structure to induce regular node embeddings and predictions with a regular GNN baseline, while the auxiliary module constructs a new graph structure through fine-grained spectral clusterings and learns new node embeddings and predictions. By integrating the two modules in a dual GNN learning framework, we perform joint learning in an end-to-end fashion. This general framework can be applied on many GNN baseline models. The experimental results validate that the proposed dual GNN framework can greatly outperform the GNN baseline methods when the labeled nodes are scarce and the graph connectivity structure is noisy.\n",
      "We study the problem of reconstructing a causal graphical model from data in the presence of latent variables. The main problem of interest is recovering the causal structure over the latent variables while allowing for general, potentially nonlinear dependence between the variables. In many practical problems, the dependence between raw observations (e.g. pixels in an image) is much less relevant than the dependence between certain high-level, latent features (e.g. concepts or objects), and this is the setting of interest. We provide conditions under which both the latent representations and the underlying latent causal model are identifiable by a reduction to a mixture oracle. The proof is constructive, and leads to several algorithms for explicitly reconstructing the full graphical model. We discuss efficient algorithms and provide experiments illustrating the algorithms in practice.\n",
      "Despite enormous successful applications of graph neural networks (GNNs) recently, theoretical understandings of their generalization ability, especially for node-level tasks where data are not independent and identically-distributed (IID), have been sparse. The theoretical investigation of the generalization performance is beneficial for understanding fundamental issues (such as fairness) of GNN models and designing better learning methods. In this paper, we present a novel PAC-Bayesian analysis for GNNs under a non-IID semi-supervised learning setup. Moreover, we analyze the generalization performances on different subgroups of unlabeled nodes, which allows us to further study an accuracy-(dis)parity-style (un)fairness of GNNs from a theoretical perspective. Under reasonable assumptions, we demonstrate that the distance between a test subgroup and the training set can be a key factor affecting the GNN performance on that subgroup, which calls special attention to the training node selection for fair learning. Experiments across multiple GNN models and datasets support our theoretical results.\n",
      "Finding anomalous snapshots from a graph has garnered huge attention recently. Existing studies address the problem using shallow learning mechanisms such as subspace selection, ego-network, or community analysis. These models do not take into account the multifaceted interactions between the structure and attributes in the network. In this paper, we propose GraphAnoGAN, an anomalous snapshot ranking framework, which consists of two core components -- generative and discriminative models. Specifically, the generative model learns to approximate the distribution of anomalous samples from the candidate set of graph snapshots, and the discriminative model detects whether the sampled snapshot is from the ground-truth or not. Experiments on 4 real-world networks show that GraphAnoGAN outperforms 6 baselines with a significant margin (28.29% and 22.01% higher precision and recall, respectively compared to the best baseline, averaged across all datasets).\n",
      "The inclusion of temporal scopes of facts in knowledge graph embedding (KGE) presents significant opportunities for improving the resulting embeddings, and consequently for increased performance in downstream applications. Yet, little research effort has focussed on this area and much of the carried out research reports only marginally improved results compared to models trained without temporal scopes (static models). Furthermore, rather than leveraging existing work on static models, they introduce new models specific to temporal knowledge graphs. We propose a novel perspective that takes advantage of the power of existing static embedding models by focussing effort on manipulating the data instead. Our method, SpliMe, draws inspiration from the field of signal processing and early work in graph embedding. We show that SpliMe competes with or outperforms the current state of the art in temporal KGE. Additionally, we uncover issues with the procedure currently used to assess the performance of static models on temporal graphs and introduce two ways to counteract them.\n",
      "Automatic surgical gesture recognition is fundamentally important to enable intelligent cognitive assistance in robotic surgery. With recent advancement in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, rich information including surgical videos and robotic kinematics can be recorded, which provide complementary knowledge for understanding surgical gestures. However, existing methods either solely adopt uni-modal data or directly concatenate multi-modal representations, which can not sufficiently exploit the informative correlations inherent in visual and kinematics data to boost gesture recognition accuracies. In this regard, we propose a novel online approach of multi-modal relational graph network (i.e., MRG-Net) to dynamically integrate visual and kinematics information through interactive message propagation in the latent feature space. In specific, we first extract embeddings from video and kinematics sequences with temporal convolutional networks and LSTM units. Next, we identify multi-relations in these multi-modal embeddings and leverage them through a hierarchical relational graph learning module. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with state-of-the-art results on the public JIGSAWS dataset, outperforming current uni-modal and multi-modal methods on both suturing and knot typing tasks. Furthermore, we validated our method on in-house visual-kinematics datasets collected with da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) platforms in two centers, with consistent promising performance achieved.\n",
      "The mining and utilization of features directly affect the classification performance of models used in the classification and recognition of hyperspectral remote sensing images. Traditional models usually conduct feature mining from a single perspective, with the features mined being limited and the internal relationships between them being ignored. Consequently, useful features are lost and classification results are unsatisfactory. To fully mine and utilize image features, a new multi-scale feature-mining learning algorithm (MGRNet) is proposed. The model uses principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the original hyperspectral image (HSI) to retain 99.99% of its semantic information and extract dimensionality reduction features. Using a multi-scale convolution algorithm, the input dimensionality reduction features were mined to obtain shallow features, which then served as inputs into a multi-scale graph convolution algorithm to construct the internal relationships between eigenvalues at different scales. We then carried out cross fusion of multi-scale information obtained by graph convolution, before inputting the new information obtained into the residual network algorithm for deep feature mining. Finally, a flexible maximum transfer function classifier was used to predict the final features and complete the classification. Experiments on three common hyperspectral datasets showed the MGRNet algorithm proposed in this paper to be superior to traditional methods in recognition accuracy.\n",
      "We study the problem of learning control policies for complex tasks given by logical specifications. Recent approaches automatically generate a reward function from a given specification and use a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward. These approaches, however, scale poorly to complex tasks that require high-level planning. In this work, we develop a compositional learning approach, called DiRL, that interleaves high-level planning and reinforcement learning. First, DiRL encodes the specification as an abstract graph; intuitively, vertices and edges of the graph correspond to regions of the state space and simpler sub-tasks, respectively. Our approach then incorporates reinforcement learning to learn neural network policies for each edge (sub-task) within a Dijkstra-style planning algorithm to compute a high-level plan in the graph. An evaluation of the proposed approach on a set of challenging control benchmarks with continuous state and action spaces demonstrates that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.\n",
      "Cross-modal retrieval aims to enable flexible retrieval experience by combining multimedia data such as image, video, text, and audio. One core of unsupervised approaches is to dig the correlations among different object representations to complete satisfied retrieval performance without requiring expensive labels. In this paper, we propose a Graph Pattern Loss based Diversified Attention Network(GPLDAN) for unsupervised cross-modal retrieval to deeply analyze correlations among representations. First, we propose a diversified attention feature projector by considering the interaction between different representations to generate multiple representations of an instance. Then, we design a novel graph pattern loss to explore the correlations among different representations, in this graph all possible distances between different representations are considered. In addition, a modality classifier is added to explicitly declare the corresponding modalities of features before fusion and guide the network to enhance discrimination ability. We test GPLDAN on four public datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods, the experimental results demonstrate the performance and competitiveness of GPLDAN.\n",
      "Self-supervised learning of graph neural networks (GNN) is in great need because of the widespread label scarcity issue in real-world graph/network data. Graph contrastive learning (GCL), by training GNNs to maximize the correspondence between the representations of the same graph in its different augmented forms, may yield robust and transferable GNNs even without using labels. However, GNNs trained by traditional GCL often risk capturing redundant graph features and thus may be brittle and provide sub-par performance in downstream tasks. Here, we propose a novel principle, termed adversarial-GCL (AD-GCL), which enables GNNs to avoid capturing redundant information during the training by optimizing adversarial graph augmentation strategies used in GCL. We pair AD-GCL with theoretical explanations and design a practical instantiation based on trainable edge-dropping graph augmentation. We experimentally validate AD-GCL by comparing with the state-of-the-art GCL methods and achieve performance gains of up-to $14\\%$ in unsupervised, $6\\%$ in transfer, and $3\\%$ in semi-supervised learning settings overall with 18 different benchmark datasets for the tasks of molecule property regression and classification, and social network classification.\n",
      "The heterogeneity in recently published knowledge graph embedding models' implementations, training, and evaluation has made fair and thorough comparisons difficult. In order to assess the reproducibility of previously published results, we re-implemented and evaluated 21 interaction models in the PyKEEN software package. Here, we outline which results could be reproduced with their reported hyper-parameters, which could only be reproduced with alternate hyper-parameters, and which could not be reproduced at all as well as provide insight as to why this might be the case.   We then performed a large-scale benchmarking on four datasets with several thousands of experiments and 24,804 GPU hours of computation time. We present insights gained as to best practices, best configurations for each model, and where improvements could be made over previously published best configurations. Our results highlight that the combination of model architecture, training approach, loss function, and the explicit modeling of inverse relations is crucial for a model's performances, and not only determined by the model architecture. We provide evidence that several architectures can obtain results competitive to the state-of-the-art when configured carefully.

      "Visual Information Extraction (VIE) task aims to extract key information from multifarious document images (e.g., invoices and purchase receipts). Most previous methods treat the VIE task simply as a sequence labeling problem or classification problem, which requires models to carefully identify each kind of semantics by introducing multimodal features, such as font, color, layout. But simply introducing multimodal features couldn't work well when faced with numeric semantic categories or some ambiguous texts. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel key-value matching model based on a graph neural network for VIE (MatchVIE). Through key-value matching based on relevancy evaluation, the proposed MatchVIE can bypass the recognitions to various semantics, and simply focuses on the strong relevancy between entities. Besides, we introduce a simple but effective operation, Num2Vec, to tackle the instability of encoded values, which helps model converge more smoothly. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MatchVIE can significantly outperform previous methods. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, MatchVIE may be the first attempt to tackle the VIE task by modeling the relevancy between keys and values and it is a good complement to the existing methods.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) emerged recently as a standard toolkit for learning from data on graphs. Current GNN designing works depend on immense human expertise to explore different message-passing mechanisms, and require manual enumeration to determine the proper message-passing depth. Inspired by the strong searching capability of neural architecture search (NAS) in CNN, this paper proposes Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) with novel-designed search space. The GNAS can automatically learn better architecture with the optimal depth of message passing on the graph. Specifically, we design Graph Neural Architecture Paradigm (GAP) with tree-topology computation procedure and two types of fine-grained atomic operations (feature filtering and neighbor aggregation) from message-passing mechanism to construct powerful graph network search space. Feature filtering performs adaptive feature selection, and neighbor aggregation captures structural information and calculates neighbors' statistics. Experiments show that our GNAS can search for better GNNs with multiple message-passing mechanisms and optimal message-passing depth. The searched network achieves remarkable improvement over state-of-the-art manual designed and search-based GNNs on five large-scale datasets at three classical graph tasks.

      "Algorithmic recourse aims to provide actionable recommendations to individuals to obtain a more favourable outcome from an automated decision-making system. As it involves reasoning about interventions performed in the physical world, recourse is fundamentally a causal problem. Existing methods compute the effect of recourse actions using a causal model learnt from data under the assumption of no hidden confounding and modelling assumptions such as additive noise. Building on the seminal work of Balke and Pearl (1994), we propose an alternative approach for discrete random variables which relaxes these assumptions and allows for unobserved confounding and arbitrary structural equations. The proposed approach only requires specification of the causal graph and confounding structure and bounds the expected counterfactual effect of recourse actions. If the lower bound is above a certain threshold, i.e., on the other side of the decision boundary, recourse is guaranteed in expectation.\n",
      "A graph-inspired classifier, known as Optimum-Path Forest (OPF), has proven to be a state-of-the-art algorithm comparable to Logistic Regressors, Support Vector Machines in a wide variety of tasks. Recently, its Python-based version, denoted as OPFython, has been proposed to provide a more friendly framework and a faster prototyping environment. Nevertheless, Python-based algorithms are slower than their counterpart C-based algorithms, impacting their performance when confronted with large amounts of data. Therefore, this paper proposed a simple yet highly efficient speed up using the Numba package, which accelerates Numpy-based calculations and attempts to increase the algorithm's overall performance.

However in most industries, data exists in the form of isolated islands and the data privacy and security is also an important issue. In this paper, we propose FedVGCN, a federated GCN learning paradigm for privacy-preserving node classification task under data vertically partitioned setting, which can be generalized to existing GCN models. Specifically, we split the computation graph data into two parts. For each iteration of the training process, the two parties transfer intermediate results to each other under homomorphic encryption. We conduct experiments on benchmark data and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedVGCN in the case of GraphSage.\n",

Graph neural ordinary differential equations (GDEs) are formalized as the counterpart to GNNs where the input-output relationship is determined by a continuum of GNN layers, blending discrete topological structures and differential equations. The proposed framework is shown to be compatible with various static and autoregressive GNN models. Results prove general effectiveness of GDEs: in static settings they offer computational advantages by incorporating numerical methods in their forward pass; in dynamic settings, on the other hand, they are shown to improve performance by exploiting the geometry of the underlying dynamics.\n",

      "Routing methods in capsule networks often learn a hierarchical relationship for capsules in successive layers, but the intra-relation between capsules in the same layer is less studied, while this intra-relation is a key factor for the semantic understanding in text data. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a new capsule network with graph routing to learn both relationships, where capsules in each layer are treated as the nodes of a graph. We investigate strategies to yield adjacency and degree matrix with three different distances from a layer of capsules, and propose the graph routing mechanism between those capsules. We validate our approach on five text classification datasets, and our findings suggest that the approach combining bottom-up routing and top-down attention performs the best. Such an approach demonstrates generalization capability across datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art routing methods, the improvements in accuracy in the five datasets we used were 0.82, 0.39, 0.07, 1.01, and 0.02, respectively.\n",
      "The abundance of data has given machine learning huge momentum in natural sciences and engineering. However, the modeling of simulated physical processes remains difficult. A key problem in doing so is the correct handling of geometric boundaries. While triangularized geometric boundaries are very common in engineering applications, they are notoriously difficult to model by machine learning approaches due to their heterogeneity with respect to size and orientation. In this work, we introduce Boundary Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs), which dynamically modify graph structures to address boundary conditions. Boundary graph structures are constructed via modifying edges, augmenting node features, and dynamically inserting virtual nodes. The new BGNNs are tested on complex 3D granular flow processes of hoppers and rotating drums which are standard parts of industrial machinery. Using precise simulations that are obtained by an expensive and complex discrete element method, BGNNs are evaluated in terms of computational efficiency as well as prediction accuracy of particle flows and mixing entropies. Even if complex boundaries are present, BGNNs are able to accurately reproduce 3D granular flows within simulation uncertainties over hundreds of thousands of simulation timesteps, and most notably particles completely stay within the geometric objects without using handcrafted conditions or restrictions.\n",
      "Recent years have witnessed great success in handling node classification tasks with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most existing GNNs are based on the assumption that node samples for different classes are balanced, while for many real-world graphs, there exists the problem of class imbalance, i.e., some classes may have much fewer samples than others. In this case, directly training a GNN classifier with raw data would under-represent samples from those minority classes and result in sub-optimal performance. This paper presents GraphMixup, a novel mixup-based framework for improving class-imbalanced node classification on graphs. However, directly performing mixup in the input space or embedding space may produce out-of-domain samples due to the extreme sparsity of minority classes; hence we construct semantic relation spaces that allows the Feature Mixup to be performed at the semantic level. Moreover, we apply two context-based self-supervised techniques to capture both local and global information in the graph structure and then propose Edge Mixup specifically for graph data. Finally, we develop a \\emph{Reinforcement Mixup} mechanism to adaptively determine how many samples are to be generated by mixup for those minority classes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that GraphMixup yields truly encouraging results for class-imbalanced node classification tasks.\n",
      "Many representative graph neural networks, $e.g.$, GPR-GNN and ChebyNet, approximate graph convolutions with graph spectral filters. However, existing work either applies predefined filter weights or learns them without necessary constraints, which may lead to oversimplified or ill-posed filters. To overcome these issues, we propose $\\textit{BernNet}$, a novel graph neural network with theoretical support that provides a simple but effective scheme for designing and learning arbitrary graph spectral filters. In particular, for any filter over the normalized Laplacian spectrum of a graph, our BernNet estimates it by an order-$K$ Bernstein polynomial approximation and designs its spectral property by setting the coefficients of the Bernstein basis. Moreover, we can learn the coefficients (and the corresponding filter weights) based on observed graphs and their associated signals and thus achieve the BernNet specialized for the data. Our experiments demonstrate that BernNet can learn arbitrary spectral filters, including complicated band-rejection and comb filters, and it achieves superior performance in real-world graph modeling tasks.\n",

With broad deployments of GNNs in real-world applications, there is an urgent need for understanding the robustness of GNNs under adversarial attacks, especially in realistic setups. In this work, we study the problem of attacking GNNs in a restricted and realistic setup, by perturbing the features of a small set of nodes, with no access to model parameters and model predictions. Our formal analysis draws a connection between this type of attacks and an influence maximization problem on the graph. This connection not only enhances our understanding on the problem of adversarial attack on GNNs, but also allows us to propose a group of effective and practical attack strategies. Our experiments verify that the proposed attack strategies significantly degrade the performance of three popular GNN models and outperform baseline adversarial attack strategies.\n",
      "We developed Distilled Graph Attention Policy Networks (DGAPNs), a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning model to generate novel graph-structured chemical representations that optimize user-defined objectives by efficiently navigating a physically constrained domain. The framework is examined on the task of generating molecules that are designed to bind, noncovalently, to functional sites of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We present a spatial Graph Attention Network (sGAT) that leverages self-attention over both node and edge attributes as well as encoding spatial structure -- this capability is of considerable interest in areas such as molecular and synthetic biology and drug discovery. An attentional policy network is then introduced to learn decision rules for a dynamic, fragment-based chemical environment, and state-of-the-art policy gradient techniques are employed to train the network with enhanced stability. Exploration is efficiently encouraged by incorporating innovation reward bonuses learned and proposed by random network distillation. In experiments, our framework achieved outstanding results compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while increasing the diversity of proposed molecules and reducing the complexity of paths to chemical synthesis.\n",
      "In recent years, phishing scams have become the crime type with the largest money involved on Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain platform. Meanwhile, graph neural network (GNN) has shown promising performance in various node classification tasks. However, for Ethereum transaction data, which could be naturally abstracted to a real-world complex graph, the scarcity of labels and the huge volume of transaction data make it difficult to take advantage of GNN methods. Here in this paper, to address the two challenges, we propose a Self-supervised Incremental deep Graph learning model (SIEGE), for the phishing scam detection problem on Ethereum. In our model, two pretext tasks designed from spatial and temporal perspectives help us effectively learn useful node embedding from the huge amount of unlabelled transaction data. And the incremental paradigm allows us to efficiently handle large-scale transaction data and help the model maintain good performance when the data distribution is drastically changing. We collect transaction records about half a year from Ethereum and our extensive experiments show that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in both transductive and inductive settings.\n",
      "In recent years, multi-view subspace clustering has achieved impressive performance due to the exploitation of complementary imformation across multiple views. However, multi-view data can be very complicated and are not easy to cluster in real-world applications. Most existing methods operate on raw data and may not obtain the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel multi-view clustering method named smoothed multi-view subspace clustering (SMVSC) by employing a novel technique, i.e., graph filtering, to obtain a smooth representation for each view, in which similar data points have similar feature values. Specifically, it retains the graph geometric features through applying a low-pass filter. Consequently, it produces a ``clustering-friendly\" representation and greatly facilitates the downstream clustering task. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our approach. Analysis shows that graph filtering increases the separability of classes.\n",
      "Finding a suitable data representation for a specific task has been shown to be crucial in many applications. The success of subspace clustering depends on the assumption that the data can be separated into different subspaces. However, this simple assumption does not always hold since the raw data might not be separable into subspaces. To recover the ``clustering-friendly'' representation and facilitate the subsequent clustering, we propose a graph filtering approach by which a smooth representation is achieved. Specifically, it injects graph similarity into data features by applying a low-pass filter to extract useful data representations for clustering. Extensive experiments on image and document clustering datasets demonstrate that our method improves upon state-of-the-art subspace clustering techniques. Especially, its comparable performance with deep learning methods emphasizes the effectiveness of the simple graph filtering scheme for many real-world applications. An ablation study shows that graph filtering can remove noise, preserve structure in the image, and increase the separability of classes.\n",
      "We present an approach for maximizing a global utility function by learning how to allocate resources in an unsupervised way. We expect interactions between allocation targets to be important and therefore propose to learn the reward structure for near-optimal allocation policies with a GNN. By relaxing the resource constraint, we can employ gradient-based optimization in contrast to more standard evolutionary algorithms. Our algorithm is motivated by a problem in modern astronomy, where one needs to select-based on limited initial information-among $10^9$ galaxies those whose detailed measurement will lead to optimal inference of the composition of the universe. Our technique presents a way of flexibly learning an allocation strategy by only requiring forward simulators for the physics of interest and the measurement process. We anticipate that our technique will also find applications in a range of resource allocation problems.\n",
      "Deep graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved excellent results on various tasks on increasingly large graph datasets with millions of nodes and edges. However, memory complexity has become a major obstacle when training deep GNNs for practical applications due to the immense number of nodes, edges, and intermediate activations. To improve the scalability of GNNs, prior works propose smart graph sampling or partitioning strategies to train GNNs with a smaller set of nodes or sub-graphs. In this work, we study reversible connections, group convolutions, weight tying, and equilibrium models to advance the memory and parameter efficiency of GNNs. We find that reversible connections in combination with deep network architectures enable the training of overparameterized GNNs that significantly outperform existing methods on multiple datasets. Our models RevGNN-Deep (1001 layers with 80 channels each) and RevGNN-Wide (448 layers with 224 channels each) were both trained on a single commodity GPU and achieve an ROC-AUC of $87.74 \\pm 0.13$ and $88.24 \\pm 0.15$ on the ogbn-proteins dataset. To the best of our knowledge, RevGNN-Deep is the deepest GNN in the literature by one order of magnitude.

      "We propose to explain the behavior of black-box prediction methods (e.g., deep neural networks trained on image pixel data) using causal graphical models. Specifically, we explore learning the structure of a causal graph where the nodes represent prediction outcomes along with a set of macro-level \"interpretable\" features, while allowing for arbitrary unmeasured confounding among these variables. The resulting graph may indicate which of the interpretable features, if any, are possible causes of the prediction outcome and which may be merely associated with prediction outcomes due to confounding. The approach is motivated by a counterfactual theory of causal explanation wherein good explanations point to factors that are \"difference-makers\" in an interventionist sense. The resulting analysis may be useful in algorithm auditing and evaluation, by identifying features which make a causal difference to the algorithm's output.\n",
      "This paper addresses unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) using multi-label prediction and classification based on graph-structural insight. Our method extracts features from person images and produces a graph that consists of the features and a pairwise similarity of them as nodes and edges, respectively. Based on the graph, the proposed graph structure based multi-label prediction (GSMLP) method predicts multi-labels by considering the pairwise similarity and the adjacency node distribution of each node. The multi-labels created by GSMLP are applied to the proposed selective multi-label classification (SMLC) loss. SMLC integrates a hard-sample mining scheme and a multi-label classification. The proposed GSMLP and SMLC boost the performance of unsupervised person Re-ID without any pre-labelled dataset. Experimental results justify the superiority of the proposed method in unsupervised person Re-ID by producing state-of-the-art performance. The source code for this paper is publicly available on 'https://github.com/uknownpioneer/GSMLP-SMLC.git'.\n",
      "Nowadays, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) following the Message Passing paradigm become the dominant way to learn on graphic data. Models in this paradigm have to spend extra space to look up adjacent nodes with adjacency matrices and extra time to aggregate multiple messages from adjacent nodes. To address this issue, we develop a method called LinkDist that distils self-knowledge from connected node pairs into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) without the need to aggregate messages. Experiment with 8 real-world datasets shows the MLP derived from LinkDist can predict the label of a node without knowing its adjacencies but achieve comparable accuracy against GNNs in the contexts of semi- and full-supervised node classification. Moreover, LinkDist benefits from its Non-Message Passing paradigm that we can also distil self-knowledge from arbitrarily sampled node pairs in a contrastive way to further boost the performance of LinkDist.\n",
      "Recently, the transductive graph-based methods have achieved great success in the few-shot classification task. However, most existing methods ignore exploring the class-level knowledge that can be easily learned by humans from just a handful of samples. In this paper, we propose an Explicit Class Knowledge Propagation Network (ECKPN), which is composed of the comparison, squeeze and calibration modules, to address this problem. Specifically, we first employ the comparison module to explore the pairwise sample relations to learn rich sample representations in the instance-level graph. Then, we squeeze the instance-level graph to generate the class-level graph, which can help obtain the class-level visual knowledge and facilitate modeling the relations of different classes. Next, the calibration module is adopted to characterize the relations of the classes explicitly to obtain the more discriminative class-level knowledge representations. Finally, we combine the class-level knowledge with the instance-level sample representations to guide the inference of the query samples. We conduct extensive experiments on four few-shot classification benchmarks, and the experimental results show that the proposed ECKPN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Graph self-supervised learning has gained increasing attention due to its capacity to learn expressive node representations. Many pretext tasks, or loss functions have been designed from distinct perspectives. However, we observe that different pretext tasks affect downstream tasks differently cross datasets, which suggests that searching pretext tasks is crucial for graph self-supervised learning. Different from existing works focusing on designing single pretext tasks, this work aims to investigate how to automatically leverage multiple pretext tasks effectively. Nevertheless, evaluating representations derived from multiple pretext tasks without direct access to ground truth labels makes this problem challenging. To address this obstacle, we make use of a key principle of many real-world graphs, i.e., homophily, or the principle that ``like attracts like,'' as the guidance to effectively search various self-supervised pretext tasks. We provide theoretical understanding and empirical evidence to justify the flexibility of homophily in this search task. Then we propose the AutoSSL framework which can automatically search over combinations of various self-supervised tasks. By evaluating the framework on 7 real-world datasets, our experimental results show that AutoSSL can significantly boost the performance on downstream tasks including node clustering and node classification compared with training under individual tasks. Code will be released at https://github.com/ChandlerBang/AutoSSL.\n",
      "We prove that the $\\alpha$-expansion algorithm for MAP inference always returns a globally optimal assignment for Markov Random Fields with Potts pairwise potentials, with a catch: the returned assignment is only guaranteed to be optimal for an instance within a small perturbation of the original problem instance. In other words, all local minima with respect to expansion moves are global minima to slightly perturbed versions of the problem. On \"real-world\" instances, MAP assignments of small perturbations of the problem should be very similar to the MAP assignment(s) of the original problem instance. We design an algorithm that can certify whether this is the case in practice. On several MAP inference problem instances from computer vision, this algorithm certifies that MAP solutions to all of these perturbations are very close to solutions of the original instance. These results taken together give a cohesive explanation for the good performance of \"graph cuts\" algorithms in practice. Every local expansion minimum is a global minimum in a small perturbation of the problem, and all of these global minima are close to the original solution.\n",
      "Learning the causal structure that underlies data is a crucial step towards robust real-world decision making. The majority of existing work in causal inference focuses on determining a single directed acyclic graph (DAG) or a Markov equivalence class thereof. However, a crucial aspect to acting intelligently upon the knowledge about causal structure which has been inferred from finite data demands reasoning about its uncertainty. For instance, planning interventions to find out more about the causal mechanisms that govern our data requires quantifying epistemic uncertainty over DAGs. While Bayesian causal inference allows to do so, the posterior over DAGs becomes intractable even for a small number of variables. Aiming to overcome this issue, we propose a form of variational inference over the graphs of Structural Causal Models (SCMs). To this end, we introduce a parametric variational family modelled by an autoregressive distribution over the space of discrete DAGs. Its number of parameters does not grow exponentially with the number of variables and can be tractably learned by maximising an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed variational posterior is able to provide a good approximation of the true posterior.\n",
      "Recently directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure learning is formulated as a constrained continuous optimization problem with continuous acyclicity constraints and was solved iteratively through subproblem optimization. To further improve efficiency, we propose a novel learning framework to model and learn the weighted adjacency matrices in the DAG space directly. Specifically, we first show that the set of weighted adjacency matrices of DAGs are equivalent to the set of weighted gradients of graph potential functions, and one may perform structure learning by searching in this equivalent set of DAGs. To instantiate this idea, we propose a new algorithm, DAG-NoCurl, which solves the optimization problem efficiently with a two-step procedure: 1) first we find an initial cyclic solution to the optimization problem, and 2) then we employ the Hodge decomposition of graphs and learn an acyclic graph by projecting the cyclic graph to the gradient of a potential function. Experimental studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method provides comparable accuracy but better efficiency than baseline DAG structure learning methods on both linear and generalized structural equation models, often by more than one order of magnitude.\n",
      "A black-box spectral method is introduced for evaluating the adversarial robustness of a given machine learning (ML) model. Our approach, named SPADE, exploits bijective distance mapping between the input/output graphs constructed for approximating the manifolds corresponding to the input/output data. By leveraging the generalized Courant-Fischer theorem, we propose a SPADE score for evaluating the adversarial robustness of a given model, which is proved to be an upper bound of the best Lipschitz constant under the manifold setting. To reveal the most non-robust data samples highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, we develop a spectral graph embedding procedure leveraging dominant generalized eigenvectors. This embedding step allows assigning each data sample a robustness score that can be further harnessed for more effective adversarial training. Our experiments show the proposed SPADE method leads to promising empirical results for neural network models that are adversarially trained with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets.\n",
      "Given high-dimensional time series data (e.g., sensor data), how can we detect anomalous events, such as system faults and attacks? More challengingly, how can we do this in a way that captures complex inter-sensor relationships, and detects and explains anomalies which deviate from these relationships? Recently, deep learning approaches have enabled improvements in anomaly detection in high-dimensional datasets; however, existing methods do not explicitly learn the structure of existing relationships between variables, or use them to predict the expected behavior of time series. Our approach combines a structure learning approach with graph neural networks, additionally using attention weights to provide explainability for the detected anomalies. Experiments on two real-world sensor datasets with ground truth anomalies show that our method detects anomalies more accurately than baseline approaches, accurately captures correlations between sensors, and allows users to deduce the root cause of a detected anomaly.\n",
      "Deep neural networks have revolutionized many machine learning tasks in power systems, ranging from pattern recognition to signal processing. The data in these tasks is typically represented in Euclidean domains. Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of applications in power systems, where data are collected from non-Euclidean domains and represented as graph-structured data with high dimensional features and interdependency among nodes. The complexity of graph-structured data has brought significant challenges to the existing deep neural networks defined in Euclidean domains. Recently, many publications generalizing deep neural networks for graph-structured data in power systems have emerged. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in power systems is proposed. Specifically, several classical paradigms of GNNs structures (e.g., graph convolutional networks) are summarized, and key applications in power systems, such as fault scenario application, time series prediction, power flow calculation, and data generation are reviewed in detail. Furthermore, main issues and some research trends about the applications of GNNs in power systems are discussed.\n",
      "In this survey paper, we analyze image based graph neural networks and propose a three-step classification approach. We first convert the image into superpixels using the Quickshift algorithm so as to reduce 30% of the input data. The superpixels are subsequently used to generate a region adjacency graph. Finally, the graph is passed through a state-of-art graph convolutional neural network to get classification scores. We also analyze the spatial and spectral convolution filtering techniques in graph neural networks. Spectral-based models perform better than spatial-based models and classical CNN with lesser compute cost.\n",
      "What is the value of an individual model in an ensemble of binary classifiers? We answer this question by introducing a class of transferable utility cooperative games called \\textit{ensemble games}. In machine learning ensembles, pre-trained models cooperate to make classification decisions. To quantify the importance of models in these ensemble games, we define \\textit{Troupe} -- an efficient algorithm which allocates payoffs based on approximate Shapley values of the classifiers. We argue that the Shapley value of models in these games is an effective decision metric for choosing a high performing subset of models from the ensemble. Our analytical findings prove that our Shapley value estimation scheme is precise and scalable; its performance increases with size of the dataset and ensemble. Empirical results on real world graph classification tasks demonstrate that our algorithm produces high quality estimates of the Shapley value. We find that Shapley values can be utilized for ensemble pruning, and that adversarial models receive a low valuation. Complex classifiers are frequently found to be responsible for both correct and incorrect classification decisions.\n",
      "We introduce a framework for learning from multiple generated graph views, named graph symbiosis learning (GraphSym). In GraphSym, graph neural networks (GNN) developed in multiple generated graph views can adaptively exchange parameters with each other and fuse information stored in linkage structures and node features. Specifically, we propose a novel adaptive exchange method to iteratively substitute redundant channels in the weight matrix of one GNN with informative channels of another GNN in a layer-by-layer manner. GraphSym does not rely on specific methods to generate multiple graph views and GNN architectures. Thus, existing GNNs can be seamlessly integrated into our framework. On 3 semi-supervised node classification datasets, GraphSym outperforms previous single-graph and multiple-graph GNNs without knowledge distillation, and achieves new state-of-the-art results. We also conduct a series of experiments on 15 public benchmarks, 8 popular GNN models, and 3 graph tasks -- node classification, graph classification, and edge prediction -- and show that GraphSym consistently achieves better performance than existing popular GNNs by 1.9\\%$\\sim$3.9\\% on average and their ensembles. Extensive ablation studies and experiments on the few-shot setting also demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphSym.\n",
      "Vast amount of data generated from networks of sensors, wearables, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices underscores the need for advanced modeling techniques that leverage the spatio-temporal structure of decentralized data due to the need for edge computation and licensing (data access) issues. While federated learning (FL) has emerged as a framework for model training without requiring direct data sharing and exchange, effectively modeling the complex spatio-temporal dependencies to improve forecasting capabilities still remains an open problem. On the other hand, state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models assume unfettered access to the data, neglecting constraints on data sharing. To bridge this gap, we propose a federated spatio-temporal model -- Cross-Node Federated Graph Neural Network (CNFGNN) -- which explicitly encodes the underlying graph structure using graph neural network (GNN)-based architecture under the constraint of cross-node federated learning, which requires that data in a network of nodes is generated locally on each node and remains decentralized. CNFGNN operates by disentangling the temporal dynamics modeling on devices and spatial dynamics on the server, utilizing alternating optimization to reduce the communication cost, facilitating computations on the edge devices. Experiments on the traffic flow forecasting task show that CNFGNN achieves the best forecasting performance in both transductive and inductive learning settings with no extra computation cost on edge devices, while incurring modest communication cost.\n",
      "Node clustering is a powerful tool in the analysis of networks. Here, we introduce a graph neural network framework with a novel scalable Directed Mixed Path Aggregation(DIMPA) scheme to obtain node embeddings for directed networks in a self-supervised manner, including a novel probabilistic imbalance loss. The method is end-to-end in combining embedding generation and clustering without an intermediate step. In contrast to standard approaches in the literature, in this paper, directionality is not treated as a nuisance, but rather contains the main signal. In particular, we leverage the recently introduced cut flow imbalance measure, which is tightly related to directionality; cut flow imbalance is optimized without resorting to spectral methods or cluster labels. Experimental results on synthetic data, in the form of directed stochastic block models and real-world data at different scales, demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art results on directed clustering, for a wide range of noise and sparsity levels, as well as graph structures.\n",
      "Electronic Health Records (EHR) have been heavily used in modern healthcare systems for recording patients' admission information to hospitals. Many data-driven approaches employ temporal features in EHR for predicting specific diseases, readmission times, or diagnoses of patients. However, most existing predictive models cannot fully utilize EHR data, due to an inherent lack of labels in supervised training for some temporal events. Moreover, it is hard for existing works to simultaneously provide generic and personalized interpretability. To address these challenges, we first propose a hyperbolic embedding method with information flow to pre-train medical code representations in a hierarchical structure. We incorporate these pre-trained representations into a graph neural network to detect disease complications, and design a multi-level attention method to compute the contributions of particular diseases and admissions, thus enhancing personalized interpretability. We present a new hierarchy-enhanced historical prediction proxy task in our self-supervised learning framework to fully utilize EHR data and exploit medical domain knowledge. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments and case studies on widely used publicly available EHR datasets to verify the effectiveness of our model. The results demonstrate our model's strengths in both predictive tasks and interpretable abilities.\n",
      "Since the Message Passing (Graph) Neural Networks (MPNNs) have a linear complexity with respect to the number of nodes when applied to sparse graphs, they have been widely implemented and still raise a lot of interest even though their theoretical expressive power is limited to the first order Weisfeiler-Lehman test (1-WL). In this paper, we show that if the graph convolution supports are designed in spectral-domain by a non-linear custom function of eigenvalues and masked with an arbitrary large receptive field, the MPNN is theoretically more powerful than the 1-WL test and experimentally as powerful as a 3-WL existing models, while remaining spatially localized. Moreover, by designing custom filter functions, outputs can have various frequency components that allow the convolution process to learn different relationships between a given input graph signal and its associated properties. So far, the best 3-WL equivalent graph neural networks have a computational complexity in $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ with memory usage in $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, consider non-local update mechanism and do not provide the spectral richness of output profile. The proposed method overcomes all these aforementioned problems and reaches state-of-the-art results in many downstream tasks.\n",
      "In multiagent environments, several decision-making individuals interact while adhering to the dynamics constraints imposed by the environment. These interactions, combined with the potential stochasticity of the agents' decision-making processes, make such systems complex and interesting to study from a dynamical perspective. Significant research has been conducted on learning models for forward-direction estimation of agent behaviors, for example, pedestrian predictions used for collision-avoidance in self-driving cars. However, in many settings, only sporadic observations of agents may be available in a given trajectory sequence. For instance, in football, subsets of players may come in and out of view of broadcast video footage, while unobserved players continue to interact off-screen. In this paper, we study the problem of multiagent time-series imputation, where available past and future observations of subsets of agents are used to estimate missing observations for other agents. Our approach, called the Graph Imputer, uses forward- and backward-information in combination with graph networks and variational autoencoders to enable learning of a distribution of imputed trajectories. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of football matches, using a projective camera module to train and evaluate our model for the off-screen player state estimation setting. We illustrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, including those hand-crafted for football.\n",
      "Graph Neural Network (GNN) has been demonstrated its effectiveness in dealing with non-Euclidean structural data. Both spatial-based and spectral-based GNNs are relying on adjacency matrix to guide message passing among neighbors during feature aggregation. Recent works have mainly focused on powerful message passing modules, however, in this paper, we show that none of the message passing modules is necessary. Instead, we propose a pure multilayer-perceptron-based framework, Graph-MLP with the supervision signal leveraging graph structure, which is sufficient for learning discriminative node representation. In model-level, Graph-MLP only includes multi-layer perceptrons, activation function, and layer normalization. In the loss level, we design a neighboring contrastive (NContrast) loss to bridge the gap between GNNs and MLPs by utilizing the adjacency information implicitly. This design allows our model to be lighter and more robust when facing large-scale graph data and corrupted adjacency information. Extensive experiments prove that even without adjacency information in testing phase, our framework can still reach comparable and even superior performance against the state-of-the-art models in the graph node classification task.\n",
      "Accurate and trustworthy epidemic forecasting is an important problem that has impact on public health planning and disease mitigation. Most existing epidemic forecasting models disregard uncertainty quantification, resulting in mis-calibrated predictions. Recent works in deep neural models for uncertainty-aware time-series forecasting also have several limitations; e.g. it is difficult to specify meaningful priors in Bayesian NNs, while methods like deep ensembling are computationally expensive in practice. In this paper, we fill this important gap. We model the forecasting task as a probabilistic generative process and propose a functional neural process model called EPIFNP, which directly models the probability density of the forecast value. EPIFNP leverages a dynamic stochastic correlation graph to model the correlations between sequences in a non-parametric way, and designs different stochastic latent variables to capture functional uncertainty from different perspectives. Our extensive experiments in a real-time flu forecasting setting show that EPIFNP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and calibration metrics, up to 2.5x in accuracy and 2.4x in calibration. Additionally, due to properties of its generative process,EPIFNP learns the relations between the current season and similar patterns of historical seasons,enabling interpretable forecasts. Beyond epidemic forecasting, the EPIFNP can be of independent interest for advancing principled uncertainty quantification in deep sequential models for predictive analytics\n",
      "With graphs rapidly growing in size and deeper graph neural networks (GNNs) emerging, the training and inference of GNNs become increasingly expensive. Existing network weight pruning algorithms cannot address the main space and computational bottleneck in GNNs, caused by the size and connectivity of the graph. To this end, this paper first presents a unified GNN sparsification (UGS) framework that simultaneously prunes the graph adjacency matrix and the model weights, for effectively accelerating GNN inference on large-scale graphs. Leveraging this new tool, we further generalize the recently popular lottery ticket hypothesis to GNNs for the first time, by defining a graph lottery ticket (GLT) as a pair of core sub-dataset and sparse sub-network, which can be jointly identified from the original GNN and the full dense graph by iteratively applying UGS. Like its counterpart in convolutional neural networks, GLT can be trained in isolation to match the performance of training with the full model and graph, and can be drawn from both randomly initialized and self-supervised pre-trained GNNs. Our proposal has been experimentally verified across various GNN architectures and diverse tasks, on both small-scale graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer and PubMed), and large-scale datasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Specifically, for node classification, our found GLTs achieve the same accuracies with 20%~98% MACs saving on small graphs and 25%~85% MACs saving on large ones. For link prediction, GLTs lead to 48%~97% and 70% MACs saving on small and large graph datasets, respectively, without compromising predictive performance.

      "Many recent works have studied the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the context of graph homophily - a label-dependent measure of connectivity. Traditional GNNs generate node embeddings by aggregating information from a node's neighbors in the graph. Recent results in node classification tasks show that this local aggregation approach performs poorly in graphs with low homophily (heterophilic graphs). Several mechanisms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of GNNs on such graphs by increasing the aggregation range of a GNN layer, either through multi-hop aggregation, or through long-range aggregation from distant nodes. In this paper, we show that properly tuned classical GNNs and multi-layer perceptrons match or exceed the accuracy of recent long-range aggregation methods on heterophilic graphs. Thus, our results highlight the need for alternative datasets to benchmark long-range GNN aggregation mechanisms. We also show that homophily is a poor measure of the information in a node's local neighborhood and propose the Neighborhood Information Content(NIC) metric, which is a novel information-theoretic graph metric. We argue that NIC is more relevant for local aggregation methods as used by GNNs. We show that, empirically, it correlates better with GNN accuracy in node classification tasks than homophily.\n",
      "Areas under ROC (AUROC) and precision-recall curves (AUPRC) are common metrics for evaluating classification performance for imbalanced problems. Compared with AUROC, AUPRC is a more appropriate metric for highly imbalanced datasets. While stochastic optimization of AUROC has been studied extensively, principled stochastic optimization of AUPRC has been rarely explored. In this work, we propose a principled technical method to optimize AUPRC for deep learning. Our approach is based on maximizing the averaged precision (AP), which is an unbiased point estimator of AUPRC. We cast the objective into a sum of {\\it dependent compositional functions} with inner functions dependent on random variables of the outer level. We propose efficient adaptive and non-adaptive stochastic algorithms with {\\it provable convergence guarantee under mild conditions} by leveraging recent advances in stochastic compositional optimization. Extensive experimental results on image and graph datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms prior methods on imbalanced problems in terms of AUPRC. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first attempt to optimize AUPRC with provable convergence.\n",
      "We propose ScheduleNet, a RL-based real-time scheduler, that can solve various types of multi-agent scheduling problems. We formulate these problems as a semi-MDP with episodic reward (makespan) and learn ScheduleNet, a decentralized decision-making policy that can effectively coordinate multiple agents to complete tasks. The decision making procedure of ScheduleNet includes: (1) representing the state of a scheduling problem with the agent-task graph, (2) extracting node embeddings for agent and tasks nodes, the important relational information among agents and tasks, by employing the type-aware graph attention (TGA), and (3) computing the assignment probability with the computed node embeddings. We validate the effectiveness of ScheduleNet as a general learning-based scheduler for solving various types of multi-agent scheduling tasks, including multiple salesman traveling problem (mTSP) and job shop scheduling problem (JSP).\n",
      "We introduce a new Collaborative Causal Discovery problem, through which we model a common scenario in which we have multiple independent entities each with their own causal graph, and the goal is to simultaneously learn all these causal graphs. We study this problem without the causal sufficiency assumption, using Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAG) to model the causal graphs, and assuming that we have the ability to actively perform independent single vertex (or atomic) interventions on the entities. If the $M$ underlying (unknown) causal graphs of the entities satisfy a natural notion of clustering, we give algorithms that leverage this property and recovers all the causal graphs using roughly logarithmic in $M$ number of atomic interventions per entity. These are significantly fewer than $n$ atomic interventions per entity required to learn each causal graph separately, where $n$ is the number of observable nodes in the causal graph. We complement our results with a lower bound and discuss various extensions of our collaborative setting.\n",
      "We propose the convergent graph solver (CGS), a deep learning method that learns iterative mappings to predict the properties of a graph system at its stationary state (fixed point) with guaranteed convergence. CGS systematically computes the fixed points of a target graph system and decodes them to estimate the stationary properties of the system without the prior knowledge of existing solvers or intermediate solutions. The forward propagation of CGS proceeds in three steps: (1) constructing the input dependent linear contracting iterative maps, (2) computing the fixed-points of the linear maps, and (3) decoding the fixed-points to estimate the properties. The contractivity of the constructed linear maps guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the fixed points following the Banach fixed point theorem. To train CGS efficiently, we also derive a tractable analytical expression for its gradient by leveraging the implicit function theorem. We evaluate the performance of CGS by applying it to various network-analytic and graph benchmark problems. The results indicate that CGS has competitive capabilities for predicting the stationary properties of graph systems, irrespective of whether the target systems are linear or non-linear. CGS also shows high performance for graph classification problems where the existence or the meaning of a fixed point is hard to be clearly defined, which highlights the potential of CGS as a general graph neural network architecture.\n",
      "As machine learning becomes more widely used for critical applications, the need to study its implications in privacy turns to be urgent. Given access to the target model and auxiliary information, the model inversion attack aims to infer sensitive features of the training dataset, which leads to great privacy concerns. Despite its success in grid-like domains, directly applying model inversion techniques on non-grid domains such as graph achieves poor attack performance due to the difficulty to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of graphs and attributes of nodes used in Graph Neural Networks (GNN). To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Graph} \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nversion attack (GraphMI), which aims to extract private graph data of the training graph by inverting GNN, one of the state-of-the-art graph analysis tools. Specifically, we firstly propose a projected gradient module to tackle the discreteness of graph edges while preserving the sparsity and smoothness of graph features. Then we design a graph auto-encoder module to efficiently exploit graph topology, node attributes, and target model parameters for edge inference. With the proposed methods, we study the connection between model inversion risk and edge influence and show that edges with greater influence are more likely to be recovered. Extensive experiments over several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We also show that differential privacy in its canonical form can hardly defend our attack while preserving decent utility.\n",
      "Imbalanced classification on graphs is ubiquitous yet challenging in many real-world applications, such as fraudulent node detection. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance on many network analysis tasks. However, most existing GNNs have almost exclusively focused on the balanced networks, and would get unappealing performance on the imbalanced networks. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present a generative adversarial graph network model, called ImGAGN to address the imbalanced classification problem on graphs. It introduces a novel generator for graph structure data, named GraphGenerator, which can simulate both the minority class nodes' attribute distribution and network topological structure distribution by generating a set of synthetic minority nodes such that the number of nodes in different classes can be balanced. Then a graph convolutional network (GCN) discriminator is trained to discriminate between real nodes and fake (i.e., generated) nodes, and also between minority nodes and majority nodes on the synthetic balanced network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world imbalanced network datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method ImGAGN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for semi-supervised imbalanced node classification task.\n",
      "In recent years, causal modelling has been used widely to improve generalization and to provide interpretability in machine learning models. To determine cause-effect relationships in the absence of a randomized trial, we can model causal systems with counterfactuals and interventions given enough domain knowledge. However, there are several cases where domain knowledge is almost absent and the only recourse is using a statistical method to estimate causal relationships. While there have been several works done in estimating causal relationships in unstructured data, we are yet to find a well-defined framework for estimating causal relationships in Knowledge Graphs (KG). It is commonly used to provide a semantic framework for data with complex inter-domain relationships. In this work, we define a hybrid approach that allows us to discover cause-effect relationships in KG. The proposed approach is based around the finding of the instantaneous causal structure of a non-experimental matrix using a non-Gaussian model, i.e; finding the causal ordering of the variables in a non-Gaussian setting. The non-experimental matrix is a low-dimensional tensor projection obtained by decomposing the adjacency tensor of a KG. We use two different pre-existing algorithms, one for the causal discovery and the other for decomposing the KG and combining them to get the causal structure in a KG.\n",
      "We consider the problem of explaining the predictions of graph neural networks (GNNs), which otherwise are considered as black boxes. Existing methods invariably focus on explaining the importance of graph nodes or edges but ignore the substructures of graphs, which are more intuitive and human-intelligible. In this work, we propose a novel method, known as SubgraphX, to explain GNNs by identifying important subgraphs. Given a trained GNN model and an input graph, our SubgraphX explains its predictions by efficiently exploring different subgraphs with Monte Carlo tree search. To make the tree search more effective, we propose to use Shapley values as a measure of subgraph importance, which can also capture the interactions among different subgraphs. To expedite computations, we propose efficient approximation schemes to compute Shapley values for graph data. Our work represents the first attempt to explain GNNs via identifying subgraphs explicitly and directly. Experimental results show that our SubgraphX achieves significantly improved explanations, while keeping computations at a reasonable level.\n",
      "Graph-based Neural Networks (GNNs) are recent models created for learning representations of nodes (and graphs), which have achieved promising results when detecting patterns that occur in large-scale data relating different entities. Among these patterns, financial fraud stands out for its socioeconomic relevance and for presenting particular challenges, such as the extreme imbalance between the positive (fraud) and negative (legitimate transactions) classes, and the concept drift (i.e., statistical properties of the data change over time). Since GNNs are based on message propagation, the representation of a node is strongly impacted by its neighbors and by the network's hubs, amplifying the imbalance effects. Recent works attempt to adapt undersampling and oversampling strategies for GNNs in order to mitigate this effect without, however, accounting for concept drift. In this work, we conduct experiments to evaluate existing techniques for detecting network fraud, considering the two previous challenges. For this, we use real data sets, complemented by synthetic data created from a new methodology introduced here. Based on this analysis, we propose a series of improvement points that should be investigated in future research.\n",
      "Dynamical systems in which local interactions among agents give rise to complex emerging phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and society. This work explores the problem of inferring the unknown interaction structure (represented as a graph) of such a system from measurements of its constituent agents or individual components (represented as nodes). We consider a setting where the underlying dynamical model is unknown and where different measurements (i.e., snapshots) may be independent (e.g., may stem from different experiments). We propose GINA (Graph Inference Network Architecture), a graph neural network (GNN) to simultaneously learn the latent interaction graph and, conditioned on the interaction graph, the prediction of a node's observable state based on adjacent vertices. GINA is based on the hypothesis that the ground truth interaction graph -- among all other potential graphs -- allows to predict the state of a node, given the states of its neighbors, with the highest accuracy. We test this hypothesis and demonstrate GINA's effectiveness on a wide range of interaction graphs and dynamical processes.\n",
      "Autonomous vehicles navigate in dynamically changing environments under a wide variety of conditions, being continuously influenced by surrounding objects. Modelling interactions among agents is essential for accurately forecasting other agents' behaviour and achieving safe and comfortable motion planning. In this work, we propose SCOUT, a novel Attention-based Graph Neural Network that uses a flexible and generic representation of the scene as a graph for modelling interactions, and predicts socially-consistent trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) under mixed traffic conditions. We explore three different attention mechanisms and test our scheme with both bird-eye-view and on-vehicle urban data, achieving superior performance than existing state-of-the-art approaches on InD and ApolloScape Trajectory benchmarks. Additionally, we evaluate our model's flexibility and transferability by testing it under completely new scenarios on RounD dataset. The importance and influence of each interaction in the final prediction is explored by means of Integrated Gradients technique and the visualization of the attention learned.\n",
      "Ride-hailing demand prediction is an essential task in spatial-temporal data mining. Accurate Ride-hailing demand prediction can help to pre-allocate resources, improve vehicle utilization and user experiences. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is commonly used to model the complicated irregular non-Euclidean spatial correlations. However, existing GCN-based ride-hailing demand prediction methods only assign the same importance to different neighbor regions, and maintain a fixed graph structure with static spatial relationships throughout the timeline when extracting the irregular non-Euclidean spatial correlations. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Graph Attention Network (STDGAT), a novel ride-hailing demand prediction method. Based on the attention mechanism of GAT, STDGAT extracts different pair-wise correlations to achieve the adaptive importance allocation for different neighbor regions. Moreover, in STDGAT, we design a novel time-specific commuting-based graph attention mode to construct a dynamic graph structure for capturing the dynamic time-specific spatial relationships throughout the timeline. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world ride-hailing demand dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement of our method on three evaluation metrics RMSE, MAPE and MAE over state-of-the-art baselines.\n",
      "Sampling is an established technique to scale graph neural networks to large graphs. Current approaches however assume the graphs to be homogeneous in terms of relations and ignore relation types, critically important in biomedical graphs. Multi-relational graphs contain various types of relations that usually come with variable frequency and have different importance for the problem at hand. We propose an approach to modeling the importance of relation types for neighborhood sampling in graph neural networks and show that we can learn the right balance: relation-type probabilities that reflect both frequency and importance. Our experiments on drug-drug interaction prediction show that state-of-the-art graph neural networks profit from relation-dependent sampling in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.\n",
      "Modelers use automatic differentiation (AD) of computation graphs to implement complex Deep Learning models without defining gradient computations. Stochastic AD extends AD to stochastic computation graphs with sampling steps, which arise when modelers handle the intractable expectations common in Reinforcement Learning and Variational Inference. However, current methods for stochastic AD are limited: They are either only applicable to continuous random variables and differentiable functions, or can only use simple but high variance score-function estimators. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Storchastic, a new framework for AD of stochastic computation graphs. Storchastic allows the modeler to choose from a wide variety of gradient estimation methods at each sampling step, to optimally reduce the variance of the gradient estimates. Furthermore, Storchastic is provably unbiased for estimation of any-order gradients, and generalizes variance reduction techniques to higher-order gradient estimates. Finally, we implement Storchastic as a PyTorch library.\n",
      "Multi-modal fusion has been proved to help enhance the performance of scene classification tasks. This paper presents a 2D-3D Fusion stage that combines 3D Geometric Features with 2D Texture Features obtained by 2D Convolutional Neural Networks. To get a robust 3D Geometric embedding, a network that uses two novel layers is proposed. The first layer, Multi-Neighbourhood Graph Convolution, aims to learn a more robust geometric descriptor of the scene combining two different neighbourhoods: one in the Euclidean space and the other in the Feature space. The second proposed layer, Nearest Voxel Pooling, improves the performance of the well-known Voxel Pooling. Experimental results, using NYU-Depth-V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets, show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in RGB-D indoor scene classification task.\n",
      "In the online innovation market, the fund-raising performance of the start-up project is a concerning issue for creators, investors and platforms. Unfortunately, existing studies always focus on modeling the fund-raising process after the publishment of a project but the predicting of a project attraction in the market before setting up is largely unexploited. Usually, this prediction is always with great challenges to making a comprehensive understanding of both the start-up project and market environment. To that end, in this paper, we present a focused study on this important problem from a market graph perspective. Specifically, we propose a Graph-based Market Environment (GME) model for predicting the fund-raising performance of the unpublished project by exploiting the market environment. In addition, we discriminatively model the project competitiveness and market preferences by designing two graph-based neural network architectures and incorporating them into a joint optimization stage. Furthermore, to explore the information propagation problem with dynamic environment in a large-scale market graph, we extend the GME model with parallelizing competitiveness quantification and hierarchical propagation algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world data. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.\n",
      "Time-series forecasting is one of the most active research topics in artificial intelligence. Applications in real-world time series should consider two factors for achieving reliable predictions: modeling dynamic dependencies among multiple variables and adjusting the model's intrinsic hyperparameters. A still open gap in that literature is that statistical and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep learning methods. They generally disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the competing algorithms. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the intermediate weights arising from ReGENN, showing that by looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.\n",
      "Over the last few years, we have seen increasing data generated from non-Euclidean domains, which are usually represented as graphs with complex relationships, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have gained a high interest because of their potential in processing graph-structured data. In particular, there is a strong interest in exploring the possibilities in performing convolution on graphs using an extension of the GNN architecture, generally referred to as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN). Convolution on graphs has been achieved mainly in two forms: spectral and spatial convolutions. Due to the higher flexibility in exploring and exploiting the graph structure of data, recently, there is an increasing interest in investigating the possibilities that the spatial approach can offer. The idea of finding a way to adapt the network behaviour to the inputs they process to maximize the total performances has aroused much interest in the neural networks literature over the years. This paper presents a novel method to adapt the behaviour of a GCNN to the input proposing two ways to perform spatial convolution on graphs using input-based filters which are dynamically generated. Our model also investigates the problem of discovering and refining relations among nodes. The experimental assessment confirms the capabilities of the proposed approach, which achieves satisfying results using simple architectures with a low number of filters.\n",
      "Hand pose estimation is a crucial part of a wide range of augmented reality and human-computer interaction applications. Predicting the 3D hand pose from a single RGB image is challenging due to occlusion and depth ambiguities. GCN-based (Graph Convolutional Networks) methods exploit the structural relationship similarity between graphs and hand joints to model kinematic dependencies between joints. These techniques use predefined or globally learned joint relationships, which may fail to capture pose-dependent constraints. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage GCN-based framework that learns per-pose relationship constraints. Specifically, the first phase quantizes the 2D/3D space to classify the joints into 2D/3D blocks based on their locality. This spatial dependency information guides this phase to estimate reliable 2D and 3D poses. The second stage further improves the 3D estimation through a GCN-based module that uses an adaptative nearest neighbor algorithm to determine joint relationships. Extensive experiments show that our multi-stage GCN approach yields an efficient model that produces accurate 2D/3D hand poses and outperforms the state-of-the-art on two public datasets.\n",
      "Constraint-based methods are one of the main approaches for causal structure learning that are particularly valued as they are asymptotically guaranteed to find a structure that is Markov equivalent to the causal graph of the system. On the other hand, they may require an exponentially large number of conditional independence (CI) tests in the number of variables of the system. In this paper, we propose a novel recursive constraint-based method for causal structure learning that significantly reduces the required number of CI tests compared to the existing literature. The idea of the proposed approach is to use Markov boundary information to identify a specific variable that can be removed from the set of variables without affecting the statistical dependencies among the other variables. Having identified such a variable, we discover its neighborhood, remove that variable from the set of variables, and recursively learn the causal structure over the remaining variables. We further provide a lower bound on the number of CI tests required by any constraint-based method. Comparing this lower bound to our achievable bound demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art both on synthetic and real-world structures.\n",
      "Radiologists usually observe anatomical regions of chest X-ray images as well as the overall image before making a decision. However, most existing deep learning models only look at the entire X-ray image for classification, failing to utilize important anatomical information. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label chest X-ray classification model that accurately classifies the image finding and also localizes the findings to their correct anatomical regions. Specifically, our model consists of two modules, the detection module and the anatomical dependency module. The latter utilizes graph convolutional networks, which enable our model to learn not only the label dependency but also the relationship between the anatomical regions in the chest X-ray. We further utilize a method to efficiently create an adjacency matrix for the anatomical regions using the correlation of the label across the different regions. Detailed experiments and analysis of our results show the effectiveness of our method when compared to the current state-of-the-art multi-label chest X-ray image classification methods while also providing accurate location information.\n",
      "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) remains challenging for a number of downstream applications, such as visual robot navigation, because of rapid turns, featureless walls, and poor camera quality. We introduce the Differentiable SLAM Network (SLAM-net) along with a navigation architecture to enable planar robot navigation in previously unseen indoor environments. SLAM-net encodes a particle filter based SLAM algorithm in a differentiable computation graph, and learns task-oriented neural network components by backpropagating through the SLAM algorithm. Because it can optimize all model components jointly for the end-objective, SLAM-net learns to be robust in challenging conditions. We run experiments in the Habitat platform with different real-world RGB and RGB-D datasets. SLAM-net significantly outperforms the widely adapted ORB-SLAM in noisy conditions. Our navigation architecture with SLAM-net improves the state-of-the-art for the Habitat Challenge 2020 PointNav task by a large margin (37% to 64% success).

      "With the ever-increasing popularity and applications of graph neural networks, several proposals have been made to interpret and understand the decisions of a GNN model. Explanations for a GNN model differ in principle from other input settings. It is important to attribute the decision to input features and other related instances connected by the graph structure. We find that the previous explanation generation approaches that maximize the mutual information between the label distribution produced by the GNN model and the explanation to be restrictive. Specifically, existing approaches do not enforce explanations to be predictive, sparse, or robust to input perturbations.   In this paper, we lay down some of the fundamental principles that an explanation method for GNNs should follow and introduce a metric fidelity as a measure of the explanation's effectiveness. We propose a novel approach Zorro based on the principles from rate-distortion theory that uses a simple combinatorial procedure to optimize for fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets reveal that Zorro produces sparser, stable, and more faithful explanations than existing GNN explanation approaches.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks have emerged as a useful tool to learn on the data by applying additional constraints based on the graph structure. These graphs are often created with assumed intrinsic relations between the entities. In recent years, there have been tremendous improvements in the architecture design, pushing the performance up in various prediction tasks. In general, these neural architectures combine layer depth and node feature aggregation steps. This makes it challenging to analyze the importance of features at various hops and the expressiveness of the neural network layers. As different graph datasets show varying levels of homophily and heterophily in features and class label distribution, it becomes essential to understand which features are important for the prediction tasks without any prior information. In this work, we decouple the node feature aggregation step and depth of graph neural network and introduce several key design strategies for graph neural networks. More specifically, we propose to use softmax as a regularizer and \"Soft-Selector\" of features aggregated from neighbors at different hop distances; and \"Hop-Normalization\" over GNN layers. Combining these techniques, we present a simple and shallow model, Feature Selection Graph Neural Network (FSGNN), and show empirically that the proposed model outperforms other state of the art GNN models and achieves up to 64% improvements in accuracy on node classification tasks. Moreover, analyzing the learned soft-selection parameters of the model provides a simple way to study the importance of features in the prediction tasks. Finally, we demonstrate with experiments that the model is scalable for large graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges.\n",
      "Accurate and explainable health event predictions are becoming crucial for healthcare providers to develop care plans for patients. The availability of electronic health records (EHR) has enabled machine learning advances in providing these predictions. However, many deep learning based methods are not satisfactory in solving several key challenges: 1) effectively utilizing disease domain knowledge; 2) collaboratively learning representations of patients and diseases; and 3) incorporating unstructured text. To address these issues, we propose a collaborative graph learning model to explore patient-disease interactions and medical domain knowledge. Our solution is able to capture structural features of both patients and diseases. The proposed model also utilizes unstructured text data by employing an attention regulation strategy and then integrates attentive text features into a sequential learning process. We conduct extensive experiments on two important healthcare problems to show the competitive prediction performance of the proposed method compared with various state-of-the-art models. We also confirm the effectiveness of learned representations and model interpretability by a set of ablation and case studies.\n",
      "Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a teacher network to a student by enforcing the student to mimic the outputs of the pretrained teacher on training data. However, data samples are not always accessible in many cases due to large data sizes, privacy, or confidentiality. Many efforts have been made on addressing this problem for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose inputs lie in a grid domain within a continuous space such as images and videos, but largely overlook graph neural networks (GNNs) that handle non-grid data with different topology structures within a discrete space. The inherent differences between their inputs make these CNN-based approaches not applicable to GNNs. In this paper, we propose to our best knowledge the first dedicated approach to distilling knowledge from a GNN without graph data. The proposed graph-free KD (GFKD) learns graph topology structures for knowledge transfer by modeling them with multinomial distribution. We then introduce a gradient estimator to optimize this framework. Essentially, the gradients w.r.t. graph structures are obtained by only using GNN forward-propagation without back-propagation, which means that GFKD is compatible with modern GNN libraries such as DGL and Geometric. Moreover, we provide the strategies for handling different types of prior knowledge in the graph data or the GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFKD achieves the state-of-the-art performance for distilling knowledge from GNNs without training data.\n",
      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received a lot of interest in the recent times. From the early spectral architectures that could only operate on undirected graphs per a transductive learning paradigm to the current state of the art spatial ones that can apply inductively to arbitrary graphs, GNNs have seen significant contributions from the research community. In this paper, we utilize some theoretical tools to better visualize the operations performed by state of the art spatial GNNs. We analyze the inner workings of these architectures and introduce a simple concept, Node Masking, that allows them to generalize and scale better. To empirically validate the concept, we perform several experiments on some widely-used datasets for node classification in both the transductive and inductive settings, hence laying down strong benchmarks for future research.\n",
      "The minimum cost lifted multicut approach has proven practically good performance in a wide range of applications such as image decomposition, mesh segmentation, multiple object tracking, and motion segmentation. It addresses such problems in a graph-based model, where real-valued costs are assigned to the edges between entities such that the minimum cut decomposes the graph into an optimal number of segments. Driven by a probabilistic formulation of minimum cost multicuts, we provide a measure for the uncertainties of the decisions made during the optimization. We argue that access to such uncertainties is crucial for many practical applications and conduct an evaluation by means of sparsifications on three different, widely used datasets in the context of image decomposition (BSDS-500) and motion segmentation (DAVIS2016 and FBMS59) in terms of variation of information (VI) and Rand index (RI).\n",
      "As larger and more comprehensive datasets become standard in contemporary machine learning, it becomes increasingly more difficult to obtain reliable, trustworthy label information with which to train sophisticated models. To address this problem, crowdsourcing has emerged as a popular, inexpensive, and efficient data mining solution for performing distributed label collection. However, crowdsourced annotations are inherently untrustworthy, as the labels are provided by anonymous volunteers who may have varying, unreliable expertise. Worse yet, some participants on commonly used platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk may be adversarial, and provide intentionally incorrect label information without the end user's knowledge. We discuss three conventional models of the label generation process, describing their parameterizations and the model-based approaches used to solve them. We then propose OpinionRank, a model-free, interpretable, graph-based spectral algorithm for integrating crowdsourced annotations into reliable labels for performing supervised or semi-supervised learning. Our experiments show that OpinionRank performs favorably when compared against more highly parameterized algorithms. We also show that OpinionRank is scalable to very large datasets and numbers of label sources, and requires considerably fewer computational resources than previous approaches.\n",
      "We investigate molecular mechanisms of resistant or sensitive response of cancer drug combination therapies in an inductive and interpretable manner. Though deep learning algorithms are widely used in the drug synergy prediction problem, it is still an open problem to formulate the prediction model with biological meaning to investigate the mysterious mechanisms of synergy (MoS) for the human-AI collaboration in healthcare systems. To address the challenges, we propose a deep graph neural network, IDSP (Interpretable Deep Signaling Pathways), to incorporate the gene-gene as well as gene-drug regulatory relationships in synergic drug combination predictions. IDSP automatically learns weights of edges based on the gene and drug node relations, i.e., signaling interactions, by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and aggregates information in an inductive manner. The proposed architecture generates interpretable drug synergy prediction by detecting important signaling interactions, and can be implemented when the underlying molecular mechanism encounters unseen genes or signaling pathways. We test IDWSP on signaling networks formulated by genes from 46 core cancer signaling pathways and drug combinations from NCI ALMANAC drug combination screening data. The experimental results demonstrated that 1) IDSP can learn from the underlying molecular mechanism to make prediction without additional drug chemical information while achieving highly comparable performance with current state-of-art methods; 2) IDSP show superior generality and flexibility to implement the synergy prediction task on both transductive tasks and inductive tasks. 3) IDSP can generate interpretable results by detecting different salient signaling patterns (i.e. MoS) for different cell lines.\n",
      "Over the recent years, Graph Neural Networks have become increasingly popular in network analytic and beyond. With that, their architecture noticeable diverges from the classical multi-layered hierarchical organization of the traditional neural networks. At the same time, many conventional approaches in network science efficiently utilize the hierarchical approaches to account for the hierarchical organization of the networks, and recent works emphasize their critical importance. This paper aims to connect the dots between the traditional Neural Network and the Graph Neural Network architectures as well as the network science approaches, harnessing the power of the hierarchical network organization. A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network architecture is proposed, supplementing the original input network layer with the hierarchy of auxiliary network layers and organizing the computational scheme updating the node features through both - horizontal network connections within each layer as well as the vertical connection between the layers. It enables simultaneous learning of the individual node features along with the aggregated network features at variable resolution and uses them to improve the convergence and stability of the individual node feature learning. The proposed Hierarchical Graph Neural network architecture is successfully evaluated on the network embedding and modeling as well as network classification, node labeling, and community tasks and demonstrates increased efficiency in those.\n",
      "Co-evolving time series appears in a multitude of applications such as environmental monitoring, financial analysis, and smart transportation. This paper aims to address the following challenges, including (C1) how to incorporate explicit relationship networks of the time series; (C2) how to model the implicit relationship of the temporal dynamics. We propose a novel model called Network of Tensor Time Series, which is comprised of two modules, including Tensor Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) and Tensor Recurrent Neural Network (TRNN). TGCN tackles the first challenge by generalizing Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for flat graphs to tensor graphs, which captures the synergy between multiple graphs associated with the tensors. TRNN leverages tensor decomposition to model the implicit relationships among co-evolving time series. The experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.\n",
      "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a challenging video understanding task since it requires a deep understanding of both question and video. Previous studies mainly focus on extracting sophisticated visual and language embeddings, fusing them by delicate hand-crafted networks. However, the relevance of different frames, objects, and modalities to the question are varied along with the time, which is ignored in most of existing methods. Lacking understanding of the the dynamic relationships and interactions among objects brings a great challenge to VideoQA task. To address this problem, we propose a novel Relation-aware Hierarchical Attention (RHA) framework to learn both the static and dynamic relations of the objects in videos. In particular, videos and questions are embedded by pre-trained models firstly to obtain the visual and textual features. Then a graph-based relation encoder is utilized to extract the static relationship between visual objects. To capture the dynamic changes of multimodal objects in different video frames, we consider the temporal, spatial, and semantic relations, and fuse the multimodal features by hierarchical attention mechanism to predict the answer. We conduct extensive experiments on a large scale VideoQA dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that our RHA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Neural architecture search (NAS) has recently been addressed from various directions, including discrete, sampling-based methods and efficient differentiable approaches. While the former are notoriously expensive, the latter suffer from imposing strong constraints on the search space. Architecture optimization from a learned embedding space for example through graph neural network based variational autoencoders builds a middle ground and leverages advantages from both sides. Such approaches have recently shown good performance on several benchmarks. Yet, their stability and predictive power heavily depends on their capacity to reconstruct networks from the embedding space. In this paper, we propose a two-sided variational graph autoencoder, which allows to smoothly encode and accurately reconstruct neural architectures from various search spaces. We evaluate the proposed approach on neural architectures defined by the ENAS approach, the NAS-Bench-101 and the NAS-Bench-201 search space and show that our smooth embedding space allows to directly extrapolate the performance prediction to architectures outside the seen domain (e.g. with more operations). Thus, it facilitates to predict good network architectures even without expensive Bayesian optimization or reinforcement learning.\n",
      "Exploiting the inner-shot and inter-shot dependencies is essential for key-shot based video summarization. Current approaches mainly devote to modeling the video as a frame sequence by recurrent neural networks. However, one potential limitation of the sequence models is that they focus on capturing local neighborhood dependencies while the high-order dependencies in long distance are not fully exploited. In general, the frames in each shot record a certain activity and vary smoothly over time, but the multi-hop relationships occur frequently among shots. In this case, both the local and global dependencies are important for understanding the video content. Motivated by this point, we propose a Reconstructive Sequence-Graph Network (RSGN) to encode the frames and shots as sequence and graph hierarchically, where the frame-level dependencies are encoded by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the shot-level dependencies are captured by the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Then, the videos are summarized by exploiting both the local and global dependencies among shots. Besides, a reconstructor is developed to reward the summary generator, so that the generator can be optimized in an unsupervised manner, which can avert the lack of annotated data in video summarization. Furthermore, under the guidance of reconstruction loss, the predicted summary can better preserve the main video content and shot-level dependencies. Practically, the experimental results on three popular datasets i.e., SumMe, TVsum and VTW) have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed approach to the summarization task.\n",
      "Although neural networks are capable of reaching astonishing performances on a wide variety of contexts, properly training networks on complicated tasks requires expertise and can be expensive from a computational perspective. In industrial applications, data coming from an open-world setting might widely differ from the benchmark datasets on which a network was trained. Being able to monitor the presence of such variations without retraining the network is of crucial importance. In this article, we develop a method to monitor trained neural networks based on the topological properties of their activation graphs. To each new observation, we assign a Topological Uncertainty, a score that aims to assess the reliability of the predictions by investigating the whole network instead of its final layer only, as typically done by practitioners. Our approach entirely works at a post-training level and does not require any assumption on the network architecture, optimization scheme, nor the use of data augmentation or auxiliary datasets; and can be faithfully applied on a large range of network architectures and data types. We showcase experimentally the potential of Topological Uncertainty in the context of trained network selection, Out-Of-Distribution detection, and shift-detection, both on synthetic and real datasets of images and graphs.\n",
      "Graph data are ubiquitous in the real world. Graph learning (GL) tries to mine and analyze graph data so that valuable information can be discovered. Existing GL methods are designed for centralized scenarios. However, in practical scenarios, graph data are usually distributed in different organizations, i.e., the curse of isolated data islands. To address this problem, we incorporate federated learning into GL and propose a general Federated Graph Learning framework FedGL, which is capable of obtaining a high-quality global graph model while protecting data privacy by discovering the global self-supervision information during the federated training. Concretely, we propose to upload the prediction results and node embeddings to the server for discovering the global pseudo label and global pseudo graph, which are distributed to each client to enrich the training labels and complement the graph structure respectively, thereby improving the quality of each local model. Moreover, the global self-supervision enables the information of each client to flow and share in a privacy-preserving manner, thus alleviating the heterogeneity and utilizing the complementarity of graph data among different clients. Finally, experimental results show that FedGL significantly outperforms baselines on four widely used graph datasets.\n",
      "Multi-Label Image Classification (MLIC) aims to predict a set of labels that present in an image. The key to deal with such problem is to mine the associations between image contents and labels, and further obtain the correct assignments between images and their labels. In this paper, we treat each image as a bag of instances, and reformulate the task of MLIC as an instance-label matching selection problem. To model such problem, we propose a novel deep learning framework named Graph Matching based Multi-Label Image Classification (GM-MLIC), where Graph Matching (GM) scheme is introduced owing to its excellent capability of excavating the instance and label relationship. Specifically, we first construct an instance spatial graph and a label semantic graph respectively, and then incorporate them into a constructed assignment graph by connecting each instance to all labels. Subsequently, the graph network block is adopted to aggregate and update all nodes and edges state on the assignment graph to form structured representations for each instance and label. Our network finally derives a prediction score for each instance-label correspondence and optimizes such correspondence with a weighted cross-entropy loss. Extensive experiments conducted on various image datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.\n",
      "Alarm root cause analysis is a significant component in the day-to-day telecommunication network maintenance, and it is critical for efficient and accurate fault localization and failure recovery. In practice, accurate and self-adjustable alarm root cause analysis is a great challenge due to network complexity and vast amounts of alarms. A popular approach for failure root cause identification is to construct a graph with approximate edges, commonly based on either event co-occurrences or conditional independence tests. However, considerable expert knowledge is typically required for edge pruning. We propose a novel data-driven framework for root cause alarm localization, combining both causal inference and network embedding techniques. In this framework, we design a hybrid causal graph learning method (HPCI), which combines Hawkes Process with Conditional Independence tests, as well as propose a novel Causal Propagation-Based Embedding algorithm (CPBE) to infer edge weights. We subsequently discover root cause alarms in a real-time data stream by applying an influence maximization algorithm on the weighted graph. We evaluate our method on artificial data and real-world telecom data, showing a significant improvement over the best baselines.\n",
      "Recent studies have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable against perturbations due to lack of robustness and can therefore be easily fooled. Currently, most works on attacking GNNs are mainly using gradient information to guide the attack and achieve outstanding performance. However, the high complexity of time and space makes them unmanageable for large scale graphs and becomes the major bottleneck that prevents the practical usage. We argue that the main reason is that they have to use the whole graph for attacks, resulting in the increasing time and space complexity as the data scale grows. In this work, we propose an efficient Simplified Gradient-based Attack (SGA) method to bridge this gap. SGA can cause the GNNs to misclassify specific target nodes through a multi-stage attack framework, which needs only a much smaller subgraph. In addition, we present a practical metric named Degree Assortativity Change (DAC) to measure the impacts of adversarial attacks on graph data. We evaluate our attack method on four real-world graph networks by attacking several commonly used GNNs. The experimental results demonstrate that SGA can achieve significant time and memory efficiency improvements while maintaining competitive attack performance compared to state-of-art attack techniques.

      "We propose a method for meta-learning reinforcement learning algorithms by searching over the space of computational graphs which compute the loss function for a value-based model-free RL agent to optimize. The learned algorithms are domain-agnostic and can generalize to new environments not seen during training. Our method can both learn from scratch and bootstrap off known existing algorithms, like DQN, enabling interpretable modifications which improve performance. Learning from scratch on simple classical control and gridworld tasks, our method rediscovers the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. Bootstrapped from DQN, we highlight two learned algorithms which obtain good generalization performance over other classical control tasks, gridworld type tasks, and Atari games. The analysis of the learned algorithm behavior shows resemblance to recently proposed RL algorithms that address overestimation in value-based methods.\n",
      "Traffic prediction is the cornerstone of an intelligent transportation system. Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for the applications of smart cities, i.e., intelligent traffic management and urban planning. Although various methods are proposed for spatio-temporal modeling, they ignore the dynamic characteristics of correlations among locations on road networks. Meanwhile, most Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based works are not efficient enough due to their recurrent operations. Additionally, there is a severe lack of fair comparison among different methods on the same datasets. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel traffic prediction framework, named Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DGCRN). In DGCRN, hyper-networks are designed to leverage and extract dynamic characteristics from node attributes, while the parameters of dynamic filters are generated at each time step. We filter the node embeddings and then use them to generate a dynamic graph, which is integrated with a pre-defined static graph. As far as we know, we are the first to employ a generation method to model fine topology of dynamic graph at each time step. Further, to enhance efficiency and performance, we employ a training strategy for DGCRN by restricting the iteration number of decoder during forward and backward propagation. Finally, a reproducible standardized benchmark and a brand new representative traffic dataset are opened for fair comparison and further research. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms 15 baselines consistently.\n",
      "Graphs are widely used as a popular representation of the network structure of connected data. Graph data can be found in a broad spectrum of application domains such as social systems, ecosystems, biological networks, knowledge graphs, and information systems. With the continuous penetration of artificial intelligence technologies, graph learning (i.e., machine learning on graphs) is gaining attention from both researchers and practitioners. Graph learning proves effective for many tasks, such as classification, link prediction, and matching. Generally, graph learning methods extract relevant features of graphs by taking advantage of machine learning algorithms. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art of graph learning. Special attention is paid to four categories of existing graph learning methods, including graph signal processing, matrix factorization, random walk, and deep learning. Major models and algorithms under these categories are reviewed respectively. We examine graph learning applications in areas such as text, images, science, knowledge graphs, and combinatorial optimization. In addition, we discuss several promising research directions in this field.\n",
      "Graph convolutional network (GCN) based approaches have achieved significant progress for solving complex, graph-structured problems. GCNs incorporate the graph structure information and the node (or edge) features through message passing and computes 'deep' node representations. Despite significant progress in the field, designing GCN architectures for heterogeneous graphs still remains an open challenge. Due to the schema of a heterogeneous graph, useful information may reside multiple hops away. A key question is how to perform message passing to incorporate information of neighbors multiple hops away while avoiding the well-known over-smoothing problem in GCNs. To address this question, we propose our GCN framework 'Deep Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (DHGCN)', which takes advantage of the schema of a heterogeneous graph and uses a hierarchical approach to effectively utilize information many hops away. It first computes representations of the target nodes based on their 'schema-derived ego-network' (SEN). It then links the nodes of the same type with various pre-defined metapaths and performs message passing along these links to compute final node representations. Our design choices naturally capture the way a heterogeneous graph is generated from the schema. The experimental results on real and synthetic datasets corroborate the design choice and illustrate the performance gains relative to competing alternatives.\n",
      "Deep-learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been successfully used for process-mining tasks. They have achieved better performance for different predictive tasks than traditional approaches. We extend the existing body of research by testing four different variants of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and a fully connected Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with dropout for the tasks of predicting the nature and timestamp of the next process activity. In contrast to existing studies, we evaluate our models' performance at different stages of a process, determined by quartiles of the number of events and normalized quarters of the case duration. This provides new insights into the performance of a prediction model, as they behave differently at different stages of a business-process. Interestingly, our experiments show that the simple MLP often outperforms more sophisticated deep-learning models in both prediction tasks. We argue that care needs to be taken when applying automated process-prediction techniques at different stages of a process. We further argue that researchers should reflect their results with strong baselines methods like simple MLPs.\n",
      "Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to a wide variety of areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of transparency and interpretability. While recent developments in explainable artificial intelligence attempt to bridge this gap (e.g., by visualizing the correlation between input pixels and final outputs), these approaches are limited to explaining low-level relationships, and crucially, do not provide insights on error correction. In this work, we propose a framework (VRX) to interpret classification NNs with intuitive structural visual concepts. Given a trained classification model, the proposed VRX extracts relevant class-specific visual concepts and organizes them using structural concept graphs (SCG) based on pairwise concept relationships. By means of knowledge distillation, we show VRX can take a step towards mimicking the reasoning process of NNs and provide logical, concept-level explanations for final model decisions. With extensive experiments, we empirically show VRX can meaningfully answer \"why\" and \"why not\" questions about the prediction, providing easy-to-understand insights about the reasoning process. We also show that these insights can potentially provide guidance on improving NN's performance.\n",
      "Recently, machine learning approaches on Graph data have become very popular. It was observed that significant results were obtained by including implicit or explicit logical connections between data samples that make up the data to the model. In this context, the developing GCN model has made significant experimental contributions with Convolution filters applied to graph data. This model follows Transductive and Semi-Supervised Learning approach. Due to its transductive property, all of the data samples, which is partially labeled, are given as input to the model. Labeling, which is a cost, is very important. Within the scope of this study, the following research question is tried to be answered: If at least how many samples are labeled, the optimum model success is achieved? In addition, some experimental contributions have been made on the accuracy of the model, whichever sampling approach is used with fixed labeling effort. According to the experiments, the success of the model can be increased by using the local centrality metric.\n",
      "Most graph neural network architectures work by message-passing node vector embeddings over the adjacency matrix, and it is assumed that they capture graph topology by doing that. We design two synthetic tasks, focusing purely on topological problems -- triangle detection and clique distance -- on which graph neural networks perform surprisingly badly, failing to detect those \"bermuda\" triangles. Datasets and their generation scripts are publicly available on github.com/FujitsuLaboratories/bermudatriangles and dataset.labs.fujitsu.com.\n",
      "Landmark localization plays an important role in medical image analysis. Learning based methods, including CNN and GCN, have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance. However, most of these methods are fully-supervised and heavily rely on manual labeling of a large training dataset. In this paper, based on a fully-supervised graph-based method, DAG, we proposed a semi-supervised extension of it, termed few-shot DAG, \\ie five-shot DAG. It first trains a DAG model on the labeled data and then fine-tunes the pre-trained model on the unlabeled data with a teacher-student SSL mechanism. In addition to the semi-supervised loss, we propose another loss using JS divergence to regulate the consistency of the intermediate feature maps. We extensively evaluated our method on pelvis, hand and chest landmark detection tasks. Our experiment results demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over previous methods.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are deep learning architectures for machine learning problems on graphs. It has recently been shown that the expressiveness of GNNs can be characterised precisely by the combinatorial Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms and by finite variable counting logics. The correspondence has even led to new, higher-order GNNs corresponding to the WL algorithm in higher dimensions.   The purpose of this paper is to explain these descriptive characterisations of GNNs.\n",
      "Scene graph generation is an important visual understanding task with a broad range of vision applications. Despite recent tremendous progress, it remains challenging due to the intrinsic long-tailed class distribution and large intra-class variation. To address these issues, we introduce a novel confidence-aware bipartite graph neural network with adaptive message propagation mechanism for unbiased scene graph generation. In addition, we propose an efficient bi-level data resampling strategy to alleviate the imbalanced data distribution problem in training our graph network. Our approach achieves superior or competitive performance over previous methods on several challenging datasets, including Visual Genome, Open Images V4/V6, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality.\n",
      "SVD serves as an exploratory tool in identifying the dominant features in the form of top rank-r singular factors corresponding to the largest singular values. For Big Data applications it is well known that Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is restrictive due to main memory requirements. However, a number of applications such as community detection, clustering, or bottleneck identification in large scale graph data-sets rely upon identifying the lowest singular values and the singular corresponding vectors. For example, the lowest singular values of a graph Laplacian reveal the number of isolated clusters (zero singular values) or bottlenecks (lowest non-zero singular values) for undirected, acyclic graphs. A naive approach here would be to perform a full SVD however, this quickly becomes infeasible for practical big data applications due to the enormous memory requirements. Furthermore, for such applications only a few lowest singular factors are desired making a full decomposition computationally exorbitant. In this work, we trivially extend the previously proposed Range-Net to \\textbf{Tail-Net} for a memory and compute efficient extraction of lowest singular factors of a given big dataset and a specified rank-r. We present a number of numerical experiments on both synthetic and practical data-sets for verification and bench-marking using conventional SVD as the baseline.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNN) have been ubiquitous in graph learning tasks such as node classification. Most of GNN methods update the node embedding iteratively by aggregating its neighbors' information. However, they often suffer from negative disturbance, due to edges connecting nodes with different labels. One approach to alleviate this negative disturbance is to use attention, but current attention always considers feature similarity and suffers from the lack of supervision. In this paper, we consider the label dependency of graph nodes and propose a decoupling attention mechanism to learn both hard and soft attention. The hard attention is learned on labels for a refined graph structure with fewer inter-class edges. Its purpose is to reduce the aggregation's negative disturbance. The soft attention is learned on features maximizing the information gain by message passing over better graph structures. Moreover, the learned attention guides the label propagation and the feature propagation. Extensive experiments are performed on five well-known benchmark graph datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",
      "The significant increase in world population and urbanisation has brought several important challenges, in particular regarding the sustainability, maintenance and planning of urban mobility. At the same time, the exponential increase of computing capability and of available sensor and location data have offered the potential for innovative solutions to these challenges. In this work, we focus on the challenge of traffic forecasting and review the recent development and application of graph neural networks (GNN) to this problem. GNNs are a class of deep learning methods that directly process the input as graph data. This leverages more directly the spatial dependencies of traffic data and makes use of the advantages of deep learning producing state-of-the-art results. We introduce and review the emerging topic of GNNs, including their most common variants, with a focus on its application to traffic forecasting. We address the different ways of modelling traffic forecasting as a (temporal) graph, the different approaches developed so far to combine the graph and temporal learning components, as well as current limitations and research opportunities.\n",
      "From cutting costs to improving customer experience, forecasting is the crux of retail supply chain management (SCM) and the key to better supply chain performance. Several retailers are using AI/ML models to gather datasets and provide forecast guidance in applications such as Cognitive Demand Forecasting, Product End-of-Life, Forecasting, and Demand Integrated Product Flow. Early work in these areas looked at classical algorithms to improve on a gamut of challenges such as network flow and graphs. But the recent disruptions have made it critical for supply chains to have the resiliency to handle unexpected events. The biggest challenge lies in matching supply with demand.   Reinforcement Learning (RL) with its ability to train systems to respond to unforeseen environments, is being increasingly adopted in SCM to improve forecast accuracy, solve supply chain optimization challenges, and train systems to respond to unforeseen circumstances. Companies like UPS and Amazon have developed RL algorithms to define winning AI strategies and keep up with rising consumer delivery expectations. While there are many ways to build RL algorithms for supply chain use cases, the OpenAI Gym toolkit is becoming the preferred choice because of the robust framework for event-driven simulations.   This white paper explores the application of RL in supply chain forecasting and describes how to build suitable RL models and algorithms by using the OpenAI Gym toolkit.\n",
      "Federated learning involves a central processor that works with multiple agents to find a global model. The process consists of repeatedly exchanging estimates, which results in the diffusion of information pertaining to the local private data. Such a scheme can be inconvenient when dealing with sensitive data, and therefore, there is a need for the privatization of the algorithms. Furthermore, the current architecture of a server connected to multiple clients is highly sensitive to communication failures and computational overloads at the server. Thus in this work, we develop a private multi-server federated learning scheme, which we call graph federated learning. We use cryptographic and differential privacy concepts to privatize the federated learning algorithm that we extend to the graph structure. We study the effect of privatization on the performance of the learning algorithm for general private schemes that can be modeled as additive noise. We show under convexity and Lipschitz conditions, that the privatized process matches the performance of the non-private algorithm, even when we increase the noise variance.\n",
      "The latest Deep Learning (DL) models for detection and classification have achieved an unprecedented performance over classical machine learning algorithms. However, DL models are black-box methods hard to debug, interpret, and certify. DL alone cannot provide explanations that can be validated by a non technical audience. In contrast, symbolic AI systems that convert concepts into rules or symbols -- such as knowledge graphs -- are easier to explain. However, they present lower generalisation and scaling capabilities. A very important challenge is to fuse DL representations with expert knowledge. One way to address this challenge, as well as the performance-explainability trade-off is by leveraging the best of both streams without obviating domain expert knowledge. We tackle such problem by considering the symbolic knowledge is expressed in form of a domain expert knowledge graph. We present the eXplainable Neural-symbolic learning (X-NeSyL) methodology, designed to learn both symbolic and deep representations, together with an explainability metric to assess the level of alignment of machine and human expert explanations. The ultimate objective is to fuse DL representations with expert domain knowledge during the learning process to serve as a sound basis for explainability. X-NeSyL methodology involves the concrete use of two notions of explanation at inference and training time respectively: 1) EXPLANet: Expert-aligned eXplainable Part-based cLAssifier NETwork Architecture, a compositional CNN that makes use of symbolic representations, and 2) SHAP-Backprop, an explainable AI-informed training procedure that guides the DL process to align with such symbolic representations in form of knowledge graphs. We showcase X-NeSyL methodology using MonuMAI dataset for monument facade image classification, and demonstrate that our approach improves explainability and performance.\n",
      "With the overwhelming popularity of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), researchers have poured attention to link prediction to fill in missing facts for a long time. However, they mainly focus on link prediction on binary relational data, where facts are usually represented as triples in the form of (head entity, relation, tail entity). In practice, n-ary relational facts are also ubiquitous. When encountering such facts, existing studies usually decompose them into triples by introducing a multitude of auxiliary virtual entities and additional triples. These conversions result in the complexity of carrying out link prediction on n-ary relational data. It has even proven that they may cause loss of structure information. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we represent each n-ary relational fact as a set of its role and role-value pairs. We then propose a method called NaLP to conduct link prediction on n-ary relational data, which explicitly models the relatedness of all the role and role-value pairs in an n-ary relational fact. We further extend NaLP by introducing type constraints of roles and role-values without any external type-specific supervision, and proposing a more reasonable negative sampling mechanism. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods.\n",
      "In the last 20 years, terrorism has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and massive economic, political, and humanitarian crises in several regions of the world. Using real-world data on attacks occurred in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2001 to 2018, we propose the use of temporal meta-graphs and deep learning to forecast future terrorist targets. Focusing on three event dimensions, i.e., employed weapons, deployed tactics and chosen targets, meta-graphs map the connections among temporally close attacks, capturing their operational similarities and dependencies. From these temporal meta-graphs, we derive 2-day-based time series that measure the centrality of each feature within each dimension over time. Formulating the problem in the context of the strategic behavior of terrorist actors, these multivariate temporal sequences are then utilized to learn what target types are at the highest risk of being chosen. The paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates that engineering the feature space via temporal meta-graphs produces richer knowledge than shallow time-series that only rely on frequency of feature occurrences. Second, the performed experiments reveal that bi-directional LSTM networks achieve superior forecasting performance compared to other algorithms, calling for future research aiming at fully discovering the potential of artificial intelligence to counter terrorist violence.\n",
      "It's worth noting that the owner-member relationship between wheels and vehicles has an significant contribution to the 3D perception of vehicles, especially in the embedded environment. However, there are currently two main challenges about the above relationship prediction: i) The traditional heuristic methods based on IoU can hardly deal with the traffic jam scenarios for the occlusion. ii) It is difficult to establish an efficient applicable solution for the vehicle-mounted system. To address these issues, we propose an innovative relationship prediction method, namely DeepWORD, by designing a graph convolution network (GCN). Specifically, we utilize the feature maps with local correlation as the input of nodes to improve the information richness. Besides, we introduce the graph attention network (GAT) to dynamically amend the prior estimation deviation. Furthermore, we establish an annotated owner-member relationship dataset called WORD as a large-scale benchmark, which will be available soon. The experiments demonstrate that our solution achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time in practice.\n",
      "Conversion Rate (\\emph{CVR}) prediction in modern industrial e-commerce platforms is becoming increasingly important, which directly contributes to the final revenue. In order to address the well-known sample selection bias (\\emph{SSB}) and data sparsity (\\emph{DS}) issues encountered during CVR modeling, the abundant labeled macro behaviors ($i.e.$, user's interactions with items) are used. Nonetheless, we observe that several purchase-related micro behaviors ($i.e.$, user's interactions with specific components on the item detail page) can supplement fine-grained cues for \\emph{CVR} prediction. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel \\emph{CVR} prediction method by Hierarchically Modeling both Micro and Macro behaviors ($HM^3$). Specifically, we first construct a complete user sequential behavior graph to hierarchically represent micro behaviors and macro behaviors as one-hop and two-hop post-click nodes. Then, we embody $HM^3$ as a multi-head deep neural network, which predicts six probability variables corresponding to explicit sub-paths in the graph. They are further combined into the prediction targets of four auxiliary tasks as well as the final $CVR$ according to the conditional probability rule defined on the graph. By employing multi-task learning and leveraging the abundant supervisory labels from micro and macro behaviors, $HM^3$ can be trained end-to-end and address the \\emph{SSB} and \\emph{DS} issues. Extensive experiments on both offline and online settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed $HM^3$ over representative state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Real-time traffic prediction models play a pivotal role in smart mobility systems and have been widely used in route guidance, emerging mobility services, and advanced traffic management systems. With the availability of massive traffic data, neural network-based deep learning methods, especially the graph convolutional networks (GCN) have demonstrated outstanding performance in mining spatio-temporal information and achieving high prediction accuracy. Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of GCN under adversarial attacks, while there is a lack of studies to understand the vulnerability issues of the GCN-based traffic prediction models. Given this, this paper proposes a new task -- diffusion attack, to study the robustness of GCN-based traffic prediction models. The diffusion attack aims to select and attack a small set of nodes to degrade the performance of the entire prediction model. To conduct the diffusion attack, we propose a novel attack algorithm, which consists of two major components: 1) approximating the gradient of the black-box prediction model with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA); 2) adapting the knapsack greedy algorithm to select the attack nodes. The proposed algorithm is examined with three GCN-based traffic prediction models: St-Gcn, T-Gcn, and A3t-Gcn on two cities. The proposed algorithm demonstrates high efficiency in the adversarial attack tasks under various scenarios, and it can still generate adversarial samples under the drop regularization such as DropOut, DropNode, and DropEdge. The research outcomes could help to improve the robustness of the GCN-based traffic prediction models and better protect the smart mobility systems.

However, existing studies focus on improving the final model performance without acknowledging the computational cost of the proposed approaches, in terms of execution time and environmental impact. This paper proposes a simple yet effective KGE framework which can reduce the training time and carbon footprint by orders of magnitudes compared with state-of-the-art approaches, while producing competitive performance. We highlight three technical innovations: full batch learning via relational matrices, closed-form Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis for KGEs, and non-negative-sampling training. In addition, as the first KGE method whose entity embeddings also store full relation information, our trained models encode rich semantics and are highly interpretable. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies involving 13 strong baselines and two standard datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.\n",
      "Forecasting graph-based time-dependent data has many practical applications. This task is challenging as models need not only to capture spatial dependency and temporal dependency within the data, but also to leverage useful auxiliary information for accurate predictions. In this paper, we analyze limitations of state-of-the-art models on dealing with temporal dependency. To address this limitation, we propose GSA-Forecaster, a new deep learning model for forecasting graph-based time-dependent data. GSA-Forecaster leverages graph sequence attention (GSA), a new attention mechanism proposed in this paper, for effectively capturing temporal dependency. GSA-Forecaster embeds the graph structure of the data into its architecture to address spatial dependency. GSA-Forecaster also accounts for auxiliary information to further improve predictions. We evaluate GSA-Forecaster with large-scale real-world graph-based time-dependent data and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art models with 6.7% RMSE and 5.8% MAPE reduction.\n",
      "In this article we introduce the supervised machine learning tool called Feyn. The simulation engine that powers this tool is called the QLattice. The QLattice is a supervised machine learning tool inspired by Richard Feynman's path integral formulation, that explores many potential models that solves a given problem. It formulates these models as graphs that can be interpreted as mathematical equations, allowing the user to completely decide on the trade-off between interpretability, complexity and model performance.   We touch briefly upon the inner workings of the QLattice, and show how to apply the python package, Feyn, to scientific problems. We show how it differs from traditional machine learning approaches, what it has in common with them, as well as some of its commonalities with symbolic regression. We describe the benefits of this approach as opposed to black box models.   To illustrate this, we go through an investigative workflow using a basic data set and show how the QLattice can help you reason about the relationships between your features and do data discovery.\n",
      "In this paper, we focus on the unsupervised multi-view feature selection which tries to handle high dimensional data in the field of multi-view learning. Although some graph-based methods have achieved satisfactory performance, they ignore the underlying data structure across different views. Besides, their pre-defined laplacian graphs are sensitive to the noises in the original data space, and fail to get the optimal neighbor assignment. To address the above problems, we propose a novel unsupervised multi-view feature selection model based on graph learning, and the contributions are threefold: (1) during the feature selection procedure, the consensus similarity graph shared by different views is learned. Therefore, the proposed model can reveal the data relationship from the feature subset. (2) a reasonable rank constraint is added to optimize the similarity matrix to obtain more accurate information; (3) an auto-weighted framework is presented to assign view weights adaptively, and an effective alternative iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the problem. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "Disparate access to resources by different subpopulations is a prevalent issue in societal and sociotechnical networks. For example, urban infrastructure networks may enable certain racial groups to more easily access resources such as high-quality schools, grocery stores, and polling places. Similarly, social networks within universities and organizations may enable certain groups to more easily access people with valuable information or influence. Here we introduce a new class of problems, Graph Augmentation for Equitable Access (GAEA), to enhance equity in networked systems by editing graph edges under budget constraints. We prove such problems are NP-hard, and cannot be approximated within a factor of $(1-\\tfrac{1}{3e})$. We develop a principled, sample- and time- efficient Markov Reward Process (MRP)-based mechanism design framework for GAEA. Our algorithm outperforms baselines on a diverse set of synthetic graphs. We further demonstrate the method on real-world networks, by merging public census, school, and transportation datasets for the city of Chicago and applying our algorithm to find human-interpretable edits to the bus network that enhance equitable access to high-quality schools across racial groups. Further experiments on Facebook networks of universities yield sets of new social connections that would increase equitable access to certain attributed nodes across gender groups.\n",
      "Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.\n",
      "Auto-Encoder (AE)-based deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods have achieved impressive performance due to the powerful representation extracted using deep neural networks while prioritizing categorical separability. However, self-reconstruction loss of an AE ignores rich useful relation information and might lead to indiscriminative representation, which inevitably degrades the clustering performance. It is also challenging to learn high-level similarity without feeding semantic labels. Another unsolved problem facing DSC is the huge memory cost due to $n\\times n$ similarity matrix, which is incurred by the self-expression layer between an encoder and decoder. To tackle these problems, we use pairwise similarity to weigh the reconstruction loss to capture local structure information, while a similarity is learned by the self-expression layer. Pseudo-graphs and pseudo-labels, which allow benefiting from uncertain knowledge acquired during network training, are further employed to supervise similarity learning. Joint learning and iterative training facilitate to obtain an overall optimal solution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. By combining with the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm, we further show that our method can address the large-scale and out-of-sample problems.\n",
      "Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to design machine learning algorithms that can continually learn new concepts from a few data points, without forgetting knowledge of old classes. The difficulty lies in that limited data from new classes not only lead to significant overfitting issues but also exacerbate the notorious catastrophic forgetting problems. Moreover, as training data come in sequence in FSCIL, the learned classifier can only provide discriminative information in individual sessions, while FSCIL requires all classes to be involved for evaluation. In this paper, we address the FSCIL problem from two aspects. First, we adopt a simple but effective decoupled learning strategy of representations and classifiers that only the classifiers are updated in each incremental session, which avoids knowledge forgetting in the representations. By doing so, we demonstrate that a pre-trained backbone plus a non-parametric class mean classifier can beat state-of-the-art methods. Second, to make the classifiers learned on individual sessions applicable to all classes, we propose a Continually Evolved Classifier (CEC) that employs a graph model to propagate context information between classifiers for adaptation. To enable the learning of CEC, we design a pseudo incremental learning paradigm that episodically constructs a pseudo incremental learning task to optimize the graph parameters by sampling data from the base dataset. Experiments on three popular benchmark datasets, including CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and Caltech-USCD Birds-200-2011 (CUB200), show that our method significantly outperforms the baselines and sets new state-of-the-art results with remarkable advantages.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in graph mining. However, the inability of GNNs to model substructures in graphs remains a significant drawback. Specifically, message-passing GNNs (MPGNNs), as the prevailing type of GNNs, have been theoretically shown unable to distinguish, detect or count many graph substructures. While efforts have been paid to complement the inability, existing works either rely on pre-defined substructure sets, thus being less flexible, or are lacking in theoretical insights. In this paper, we propose GSKN, a GNN model with a theoretically stronger ability to distinguish graph structures. Specifically, we design GSKN based on anonymous walks (AWs), flexible substructure units, and derive it upon feature mappings of graph kernels (GKs). We theoretically show that GSKN provably extends the 1-WL test, and hence the maximally powerful MPGNNs from both graph-level and node-level viewpoints. Correspondingly, various experiments are leveraged to evaluate GSKN, where GSKN outperforms a wide range of baselines, endorsing the analysis.\n",
      "We consider the problem of estimating an object's physical properties such as mass, friction, and elasticity directly from video sequences. Such a system identification problem is fundamentally ill-posed due to the loss of information during image formation. Current solutions require precise 3D labels which are labor-intensive to gather, and infeasible to create for many systems such as deformable solids or cloth. We present gradSim, a framework that overcomes the dependence on 3D supervision by leveraging differentiable multiphysics simulation and differentiable rendering to jointly model the evolution of scene dynamics and image formation. This novel combination enables backpropagation from pixels in a video sequence through to the underlying physical attributes that generated them. Moreover, our unified computation graph -- spanning from the dynamics and through the rendering process -- enables learning in challenging visuomotor control tasks, without relying on state-based (3D) supervision, while obtaining performance competitive to or better than techniques that rely on precise 3D labels.\n",
      "Can we learn how to explore unknown spaces efficiently? To answer this question, we study the problem of Online Graph Exploration, the online version of the Traveling Salesperson Problem. We reformulate graph exploration as a reinforcement learning problem and apply Direct Future Prediction (Dosovitskiy and Koltun, 2017) to solve it. As the graph is discovered online, the corresponding Markov Decision Process entails a dynamic state space, namely the observable graph and a dynamic action space, namely the nodes forming the graph's frontier. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve online graph exploration in a data-driven way. We conduct experiments on six data sets of procedurally generated graphs and three real city road networks. We demonstrate that our agent can learn strategies superior to many well known graph traversal algorithms, confirming that exploration can be learned.\n",
      "Many interesting datasets ubiquitous in machine learning and deep learning can be described via graphs. As the scale and complexity of graph-structured datasets increase, such as in expansive social networks, protein folding, chemical interaction networks, and material phase transitions, improving the efficiency of the machine learning techniques applied to these is crucial. In this study, we focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that have found great success in tasks such as node or edge classification and link prediction. However, standard GNN models have scaling limits due to necessary recursive calculations performed through dense graph relationships that lead to memory and runtime bottlenecks. While new approaches for processing larger networks are needed to advance graph techniques, and several have been proposed, we study how GNNs could be parallelized using existing tools and frameworks that are known to be successful in the deep learning community. In particular, we investigate applying pipeline parallelism to GNN models with GPipe, introduced by Google in 2018.\n",
      "The graph data structure is a staple in mathematics, yet graph-based machine learning is a relatively green field within the domain of data science. Recent advances in graph-based ML and open source implementations of relevant algorithms are allowing researchers to apply methods created in academia to real-world datasets. The goal of this project was to utilize a popular graph machine learning framework, GraphSAGE, to predict mergers and acquisitions (M&A) of enterprise companies. The results were promising, as the model predicted with 81.79% accuracy on a validation dataset. Given the abundance of data sources and algorithmic decision making within financial data science, graph-based machine learning offers a performant, yet non-traditional approach to generating alpha.\n",
      "In graph neural networks (GNNs), message passing iteratively aggregates nodes' information from their direct neighbors while neglecting the sequential nature of multi-hop node connections. Such sequential node connections e.g., metapaths, capture critical insights for downstream tasks. Concretely, in recommender systems (RSs), disregarding these insights leads to inadequate distillation of collaborative signals. In this paper, we employ collaborative subgraphs (CSGs) and metapaths to form metapath-aware subgraphs, which explicitly capture sequential semantics in graph structures. We propose meta\\textbf{P}ath and \\textbf{E}ntity-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{N}etwork (PEAGNN), which trains multilayer GNNs to perform metapath-aware information aggregation on such subgraphs. This aggregated information from different metapaths is then fused using attention mechanism. Finally, PEAGNN gives us the representations for node and subgraph, which can be used to train MLP for predicting score for target user-item pairs. To leverage the local structure of CSGs, we present entity-awareness that acts as a contrastive regularizer on node embedding. Moreover, PEAGNN can be combined with prominent layers such as GAT, GCN and GraphSage. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposed technique outperforms competitive baselines on several datasets for recommendation tasks. Further analysis demonstrates that PEAGNN also learns meaningful metapath combinations from a given set of metapaths.\n",
      "Recently, adaptive graph convolutional network based traffic prediction methods, learning a latent graph structure from traffic data via various attention-based mechanisms, have achieved impressive performance. However, they are still limited to find a better description of spatial relationships between traffic conditions due to: (1) ignoring the prior of the observed topology of the road network; (2) neglecting the presence of negative spatial relationships; and (3) lacking investigation on uncertainty of the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Graph Convolutional Network (BGCN) framework to alleviate these issues. Under this framework, the graph structure is viewed as a random realization from a parametric generative model, and its posterior is inferred using the observed topology of the road network and traffic data. Specifically, the parametric generative model is comprised of two parts: (1) a constant adjacency matrix which discovers potential spatial relationships from the observed physical connections between roads using a Bayesian approach; (2) a learnable adjacency matrix that learns a global shared spatial correlations from traffic data in an end-to-end fashion and can model negative spatial correlations. The posterior of the graph structure is then approximated by performing Monte Carlo dropout on the parametric graph structure. We verify the effectiveness of our method on five real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that BGCN attains superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.\n",
      "We study the problem of dynamic visual reasoning on raw videos. This is a challenging problem; currently, state-of-the-art models often require dense supervision on physical object properties and events from simulation, which are impractical to obtain in real life. In this paper, we present the Dynamic Concept Learner (DCL), a unified framework that grounds physical objects and events from video and language. DCL first adopts a trajectory extractor to track each object over time and to represent it as a latent, object-centric feature vector. Building upon this object-centric representation, DCL learns to approximate the dynamic interaction among objects using graph networks. DCL further incorporates a semantic parser to parse questions into semantic programs and, finally, a program executor to run the program to answer the question, levering the learned dynamics model. After training, DCL can detect and associate objects across the frames, ground visual properties, and physical events, understand the causal relationship between events, make future and counterfactual predictions, and leverage these extracted presentations for answering queries. DCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on CLEVRER, a challenging causal video reasoning dataset, even without using ground-truth attributes and collision labels from simulations for training. We further test DCL on a newly proposed video-retrieval and event localization dataset derived from CLEVRER, showing its strong generalization capacity.\n",
      "We are interested in multilayer graph clustering, which aims at dividing the graph nodes into categories or communities. To do so, we propose to learn a clustering-friendly embedding of the graph nodes by solving an optimization problem that involves a fidelity term to the layers of a given multilayer graph, and a regularization on the (single-layer) graph induced by the embedding. The fidelity term uses the contrastive loss to properly aggregate the observed layers into a representative embedding. The regularization pushes for a sparse and community-aware graph, and it is based on a measure of graph sparsification called \"effective resistance\", coupled with a penalization of the first few eigenvalues of the representative graph Laplacian matrix to favor the formation of communities. The proposed optimization problem is nonconvex but fully differentiable, and thus can be solved via the descent gradient method. Experiments show that our method leads to a significant improvement w.r.t. state-of-the-art multilayer graph clustering algorithms.\n",
      "Given a stream of entries in a multi-aspect data setting i.e., entries having multiple dimensions, how can we detect anomalous activities in an unsupervised manner? For example, in the intrusion detection setting, existing work seeks to detect anomalous events or edges in dynamic graph streams, but this does not allow us to take into account additional attributes of each entry. Our work aims to define a streaming multi-aspect data anomaly detection framework, termed MSTREAM which can detect unusual group anomalies as they occur, in a dynamic manner. MSTREAM has the following properties: (a) it detects anomalies in multi-aspect data including both categorical and numeric attributes; (b) it is online, thus processing each record in constant time and constant memory; (c) it can capture the correlation between multiple aspects of the data. MSTREAM is evaluated over the KDDCUP99, CICIDS-DoS, UNSW-NB 15 and CICIDS-DDoS datasets, and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.\n",
      "A heterogeneous graph consists of different vertices and edges types. Learning on heterogeneous graphs typically employs meta-paths to deal with the heterogeneity by reducing the graph to a homogeneous network, guide random walks or capture semantics. These methods are however sensitive to the choice of meta-paths, with suboptimal paths leading to poor performance. In this paper, we propose an approach for learning on heterogeneous graphs without using meta-paths. Specifically, we decompose a heterogeneous graph into different homogeneous relation-type graphs, which are then combined to create higher-order relation-type representations. These representations preserve the heterogeneity of edges and retain their edge directions while capturing the interaction of different vertex types multiple hops apart. This is then complemented with attention mechanisms to distinguish the importance of the relation-type based neighbors and the relation-types themselves. Experiments demonstrate that our model generally outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in the vertex classification task on three commonly studied heterogeneous graph datasets.\n",
      "Indoor scene augmentation has become an emerging topic in the field of computer vision and graphics with applications in augmented and virtual reality. However, current state-of-the-art systems using deep neural networks require large datasets for training. In this paper we introduce GSACNet, a contextual scene augmentation system that can be trained with limited scene priors. GSACNet utilizes a novel parametric data augmentation method combined with a Graph Attention and Siamese network architecture followed by an Autoencoder network to facilitate training with small datasets. We show the effectiveness of our proposed system by conducting ablation and comparative studies with alternative systems on the Matterport3D dataset. Our results indicate that our scene augmentation outperforms prior art in scene synthesis with limited scene priors available.\n",
      "We study the problem of learning differentiable functions expressed as programs in a domain-specific language. Such programmatic models can offer benefits such as composability and interpretability; however, learning them requires optimizing over a combinatorial space of program \"architectures\". We frame this optimization problem as a search in a weighted graph whose paths encode top-down derivations of program syntax. Our key innovation is to view various classes of neural networks as continuous relaxations over the space of programs, which can then be used to complete any partial program. This relaxed program is differentiable and can be trained end-to-end, and the resulting training loss is an approximately admissible heuristic that can guide the combinatorial search. We instantiate our approach on top of the A-star algorithm and an iteratively deepened branch-and-bound search, and use these algorithms to learn programmatic classifiers in three sequence classification tasks. Our experiments show that the algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods for program learning, and that they discover programmatic classifiers that yield natural interpretations and achieve competitive accuracy.\n",
      "The right to be forgotten states that a data subject has the right to erase their data from an entity storing it. In the context of machine learning (ML), it requires the ML model provider to remove the data subject's data from the training set used to build the ML model, a process known as \\textit{machine unlearning}. While straightforward and legitimate, retraining the ML model from scratch upon receiving unlearning requests incurs high computational overhead when the training set is large. To address this issue, a number of approximate algorithms have been proposed in the domain of image and text data, among which SISA is the state-of-the-art solution. It randomly partitions the training set into multiple shards and trains a constituent model for each shard. However, directly applying SISA to the graph data can severely damage the graph structural information, and thereby the resulting ML model utility.   In this paper, we propose GraphEraser, a novel machine unlearning method tailored to graph data. Its contributions include two novel graph partition algorithms, and a learning-based aggregation method. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets to illustrate the unlearning efficiency and model utility of GraphEraser. We observe that GraphEraser achieves 2.06$\\times$ (small dataset) to 35.94$\\times$ (large dataset) unlearning time improvement compared to retraining from scratch. On the other hand, GraphEraser achieves up to $62.5\\%$ higher F1 score than that of random partitioning. In addition, our proposed learning-based aggregation method achieves up to $112\\%$ higher F1 score than that of the majority vote aggregation.\n",
      "Action segmentation refers to inferring boundaries of semantically consistent visual concepts in videos and is an important requirement for many video understanding tasks. For this and other video understanding tasks, supervised approaches have achieved encouraging performance but require a high volume of detailed frame-level annotations. We present a fully automatic and unsupervised approach for segmenting actions in a video that does not require any training. Our proposal is an effective temporally-weighted hierarchical clustering algorithm that can group semantically consistent frames of the video. Our main finding is that representing a video with a 1-nearest neighbor graph by taking into account the time progression is sufficient to form semantically and temporally consistent clusters of frames where each cluster may represent some action in the video. Additionally, we establish strong unsupervised baselines for action segmentation and show significant performance improvements over published unsupervised methods on five challenging action segmentation datasets.

      "Deep learning methods are achieving ever-increasing performance on many artificial intelligence tasks. A major limitation of deep models is that they are not amenable to interpretability. This limitation can be circumvented by developing post hoc techniques to explain the predictions, giving rise to the area of explainability. Recently, explainability of deep models on images and texts has achieved significant progress. In the area of graph data, graph neural networks (GNNs) and their explainability are experiencing rapid developments. However, there is neither a unified treatment of GNN explainability methods, nor a standard benchmark and testbed for evaluations. In this survey, we provide a unified and taxonomic view of current GNN explainability methods. Our unified and taxonomic treatments of this subject shed lights on the commonalities and differences of existing methods and set the stage for further methodological developments. To facilitate evaluations, we generate a set of benchmark graph datasets specifically for GNN explainability. We summarize current datasets and metrics for evaluating GNN explainability. Altogether, this work provides a unified methodological treatment of GNN explainability and a standardized testbed for evaluations.\n",

      "PanGEA, the Panoramic Graph Environment Annotation toolkit, is a lightweight toolkit for collecting speech and text annotations in photo-realistic 3D environments. PanGEA immerses annotators in a web-based simulation and allows them to move around easily as they speak and/or listen. It includes database and cloud storage integration, plus utilities for automatically aligning recorded speech with manual transcriptions and the virtual pose of the annotators. Out of the box, PanGEA supports two tasks -- collecting navigation instructions and navigation instruction following -- and it could be easily adapted for annotating walking tours, finding and labeling landmarks or objects, and similar tasks. We share best practices learned from using PanGEA in a 20,000 hour annotation effort to collect the Room-Across-Room dataset.

      "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted increasing attention due to its successful applications on various graph-structure data. However, recent studies have shown that adversarial attacks are threatening the functionality of GNNs. Although numerous works have been proposed to defend adversarial attacks from various perspectives, most of them can be robust against the attacks only on specific scenarios. To address this shortage of robust generalization, we propose to defend the adversarial attacks on GNN through applying the Spatio-Temporal sparsification (called ST-Sparse) on the GNN hidden node representation. ST-Sparse is similar to the Dropout regularization in spirit. Through intensive experiment evaluation with GCN as the target GNN model, we identify the benefits of ST-Sparse as follows: (1) ST-Sparse shows the defense performance improvement in most cases, as it can effectively increase the robust accuracy by up to 6\\% improvement; (2) ST-Sparse illustrates its robust generalization capability by integrating with the existing defense methods, similar to the integration of Dropout into various deep learning models as a standard regularization technique; (3) ST-Sparse also shows its ordinary generalization capability on clean datasets, in that ST-SparseGCN (the integration of ST-Sparse and the original GCN) even outperform the original GCN, while the other three representative defense methods are inferior to the original GCN.\n",
      "Knowledge graph (KG) embedding aims at embedding entities and relations in a KG into a lowdimensional latent representation space. Existing KG embedding approaches model entities andrelations in a KG by utilizing real-valued , complex-valued, or hypercomplex-valued (Quaternionor Octonion) representations, all of which are subsumed into a geometric algebra. In this work,we introduce a novel geometric algebra-based KG embedding framework, GeomE, which uti-lizes multivector representations and the geometric product to model entities and relations. Ourframework subsumes several state-of-the-art KG embedding approaches and is advantageouswith its ability of modeling various key relation patterns, including (anti-)symmetry, inversionand composition, rich expressiveness with higher degree of freedom as well as good general-ization capacity. Experimental results on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that theproposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models for link prediction.\n",
      "Most of existing outlier detection methods assume that the outlier factors (i.e., outlierness scoring measures) of data entities (e.g., feature values and data objects) are Independent and Identically Distributed (IID). This assumption does not hold in real-world applications where the outlierness of different entities is dependent on each other and/or taken from different probability distributions (non-IID). This may lead to the failure of detecting important outliers that are too subtle to be identified without considering the non-IID nature. The issue is even intensified in more challenging contexts, e.g., high-dimensional data with many noisy features. This work introduces a novel outlier detection framework and its two instances to identify outliers in categorical data by capturing non-IID outlier factors. Our approach first defines and incorporates distribution-sensitive outlier factors and their interdependence into a value-value graph-based representation. It then models an outlierness propagation process in the value graph to learn the outlierness of feature values. The learned value outlierness allows for either direct outlier detection or outlying feature selection. The graph representation and mining approach is employed here to well capture the rich non-IID characteristics. Our empirical results on 15 real-world data sets with different levels of data complexities show that (i) the proposed outlier detection methods significantly outperform five state-of-the-art methods at the 95%/99% confidence level, achieving 10%-28% AUC improvement on the 10 most complex data sets; and (ii) the proposed feature selection methods significantly outperform three competing methods in enabling subsequent outlier detection of two different existing detectors.\n",
      "The emergence of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has greatly boosted the progress of graph learning. However, two disturbing factors, noise and redundancy in graph data, and lack of interpretation for prediction results, impede further development of GCN. One solution is to recognize a predictive yet compressed subgraph to get rid of the noise and redundancy and obtain the interpretable part of the graph. This setting of subgraph is similar to the information bottleneck (IB) principle, which is less studied on graph-structured data and GCN. Inspired by the IB principle, we propose a novel subgraph information bottleneck (SIB) framework to recognize such subgraphs, named IB-subgraph. However, the intractability of mutual information and the discrete nature of graph data makes the objective of SIB notoriously hard to optimize. To this end, we introduce a bilevel optimization scheme coupled with a mutual information estimator for irregular graphs. Moreover, we propose a continuous relaxation for subgraph selection with a connectivity loss for stabilization. We further theoretically prove the error bound of our estimation scheme for mutual information and the noise-invariant nature of IB-subgraph. Extensive experiments on graph learning and large-scale point cloud tasks demonstrate the superior property of IB-subgraph.\n",
      "Neural link predictors are immensely useful for identifying missing edges in large scale Knowledge Graphs. However, it is still not clear how to use these models for answering more complex queries that arise in a number of domains, such as queries using logical conjunctions ($\\land$), disjunctions ($\\lor$) and existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), while accounting for missing edges. In this work, we propose a framework for efficiently answering complex queries on incomplete Knowledge Graphs. We translate each query into an end-to-end differentiable objective, where the truth value of each atom is computed by a pre-trained neural link predictor. We then analyse two solutions to the optimisation problem, including gradient-based and combinatorial search. In our experiments, the proposed approach produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods -- black-box neural models trained on millions of generated queries -- without the need of training on a large and diverse set of complex queries. Using orders of magnitude less training data, we obtain relative improvements ranging from 8% up to 40% in Hits@3 across different knowledge graphs containing factual information. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to explain the outcome of our model in terms of the intermediate solutions identified for each of the complex query atoms.

      "In this thesis, we develop various techniques for working with sets in machine learning. Each input or output is not an image or a sequence, but a set: an unordered collection of multiple objects, each object described by a feature vector. Their unordered nature makes them suitable for modeling a wide variety of data, ranging from objects in images to point clouds to graphs. Deep learning has recently shown great success on other types of structured data, so we aim to build the necessary structures for sets into deep neural networks.   The first focus of this thesis is the learning of better set representations (sets as input). Existing approaches have bottlenecks that prevent them from properly modeling relations between objects within the set. To address this issue, we develop a variety of techniques for different scenarios and show that alleviating the bottleneck leads to consistent improvements across many experiments.   The second focus of this thesis is the prediction of sets (sets as output). Current approaches do not take the unordered nature of sets into account properly. We determine that this results in a problem that causes discontinuity issues with many set prediction tasks and prevents them from learning some extremely simple datasets. To avoid this problem, we develop two models that properly take the structure of sets into account. Various experiments show that our set prediction techniques can significantly benefit over existing approaches.\n",
      "Understanding interactions between objects in an image is an important element for generating captions. In this paper, we propose a relationship-based neural baby talk (R-NBT) model to comprehensively investigate several types of pairwise object interactions by encoding each image via three different relationship-based graph attention networks (GATs). We study three main relationships: \\textit{spatial relationships} to explore geometric interactions, \\textit{semantic relationships} to extract semantic interactions, and \\textit{implicit relationships} to capture hidden information that could not be modelled explicitly as above. We construct three relationship graphs with the objects in an image as nodes, and the mutual relationships of pairwise objects as edges. By exploring features of neighbouring regions individually via GATs, we integrate different types of relationships into visual features of each node. Experiments on COCO dataset show that our proposed R-NBT model outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on COCO dataset in three image caption generation tasks.\n",

      "Spatial-temporal data forecasting of traffic flow is a challenging task because of complicated spatial dependencies and dynamical trends of temporal pattern between different roads. Existing frameworks typically utilize given spatial adjacency graph and sophisticated mechanisms for modeling spatial and temporal correlations. However, limited representations of given spatial graph structure with incomplete adjacent connections may restrict effective spatial-temporal dependencies learning of those models. To overcome those limitations, our paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph Neural Networks (STFGNN) for traffic flow forecasting. SFTGNN could effectively learn hidden spatial-temporal dependencies by a novel fusion operation of various spatial and temporal graphs, which is generated by a data-driven method. Meanwhile, by integrating this fusion graph module and a novel gated convolution module into a unified layer, SFTGNN could handle long sequences.

      "Scheduling computational tasks represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) is challenging because of its complexity. Conventional scheduling algorithms rely heavily on simple heuristics such as shortest job first (SJF) and critical path (CP), and are often lacking in scheduling quality. In this paper, we present a novel learning-based approach to scheduling DAG tasks. The algorithm employs a reinforcement learning agent to iteratively add directed edges to the DAG, one at a time, to enforce ordering (i.e., priorities of execution and resource allocation) of \"tricky\" job nodes. By doing so, the original DAG scheduling problem is dramatically reduced to a much simpler proxy problem, on which heuristic scheduling algorithms such as SJF and CP can be efficiently improved. Our approach can be easily applied to any existing heuristic scheduling algorithms. On the benchmark dataset of TPC-H, we show that our learning based approach can significantly improve over popular heuristic algorithms and consistently achieves the best performance among several methods under a variety of settings.\n",
      "Learning from source code usually requires a large amount of labeled data. Despite the possible scarcity of labeled data, the trained model is highly task-specific and lacks transferability to different tasks. In this work, we present effective pre-training strategies on top of a novel graph-based code representation, to produce universal representations for code. Specifically, our graph-based representation captures important semantics between code elements (e.g., control flow and data flow). We pre-train graph neural networks on the representation to extract universal code properties. The pre-trained model then enables the possibility of fine-tuning to support various downstream applications. We evaluate our model on two real-world datasets -- spanning over 30M Java methods and 770K Python methods. Through visualization, we reveal discriminative properties in our universal code representation. By comparing multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on method name prediction and code graph link prediction.\n",
      "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive empirical advancement across a wide variety of graph-related applications. Despite their great success, training GCNs on large graphs suffers from computational and memory issues. A potential path to circumvent these obstacles is sampling-based methods, where at each layer a subset of nodes is sampled. Although recent studies have empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of sampling-based methods, these works lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic settings and cannot fully leverage the information of evolving parameters during optimization. In this paper, we describe and analyze a general \\textbf{\\textit{doubly variance reduction}} schema that can accelerate any sampling method under the memory budget. The motivating impetus for the proposed schema is a careful analysis for the variance of sampling methods where it is shown that the induced variance can be decomposed into node embedding approximation variance (\\emph{zeroth-order variance}) during forward propagation and layerwise-gradient variance (\\emph{first-order variance}) during backward propagation. We theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed schema and show that it enjoys an $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate. We complement our theoretical results by integrating the proposed schema in different sampling methods and applying them to different large real-world graphs. Code is public available at~\\url{https://github.com/CongWeilin/SGCN.git}.\n",
      "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and their variants have achieved great success in dealing with graph-structured data. However, it is well known that deep GCNs will suffer from over-smoothing problem, where node representations tend to be indistinguishable as we stack up more layers. Although extensive research has confirmed this prevailing understanding, few theoretical analyses have been conducted to study the expressivity and trainability of deep GCNs. In this work, we demonstrate these characterizations by studying the Gaussian Process Kernel (GPK) and Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) of an infinitely-wide GCN, corresponding to the analysis on expressivity and trainability, respectively. We first prove the expressivity of infinitely-wide GCNs decaying at an exponential rate by applying the mean-field theory on GPK. Besides, we formulate the asymptotic behaviors of GNTK in the large depth, which enables us to reveal the dropping trainability of wide and deep GCNs at an exponential rate. Additionally, we extend our theoretical framework to analyze residual connection-resemble techniques. We found that these techniques can mildly mitigate exponential decay, but they failed to overcome it fundamentally. Finally, all theoretical results in this work are corroborated experimentally on a variety of graph-structured datasets.\n",
      "We study how neural networks trained by gradient descent extrapolate, i.e., what they learn outside the support of the training distribution. Previous works report mixed empirical results when extrapolating with neural networks: while feedforward neural networks, a.k.a. multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), do not extrapolate well in certain simple tasks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) -- structured networks with MLP modules -- have shown some success in more complex tasks. Working towards a theoretical explanation, we identify conditions under which MLPs and GNNs extrapolate well. First, we quantify the observation that ReLU MLPs quickly converge to linear functions along any direction from the origin, which implies that ReLU MLPs do not extrapolate most nonlinear functions. But, they can provably learn a linear target function when the training distribution is sufficiently \"diverse\". Second, in connection to analyzing the successes and limitations of GNNs, these results suggest a hypothesis for which we provide theoretical and empirical evidence: the success of GNNs in extrapolating algorithmic tasks to new data (e.g., larger graphs or edge weights) relies on encoding task-specific non-linearities in the architecture or features. Our theoretical analysis builds on a connection of over-parameterized networks to the neural tangent kernel. Empirically, our theory holds across different training settings.\n",
      "Spatiotemporal data can be represented as a process over a graph, which captures their spatial relationships either explicitly or implicitly. How to leverage such a structure for learning representations is one of the key challenges when working with graphs. In this paper, we represent the spatiotemporal relationships through product graphs and develop a first principle graph-time convolutional neural network (GTCNN). The GTCNN is a compositional architecture with each layer comprising a graph-time convolutional module, a graph-time pooling module, and a nonlinearity. We develop a graph-time convolutional filter by following the shift-and-sum principles of the convolutional operator to learn higher-level features over the product graph. The product graph itself is parametric so that we can learn also the spatiotemporal coupling from data. We develop a zero-pad pooling that preserves the spatial graph (the prior about the data) while reducing the number of active nodes and the parameters. Experimental results with synthetic and real data corroborate the different components and compare with baseline and state-of-the-art solutions.\n",
      "Recent years have seen a proliferation of new digital products for the efficient management of indoor spaces, with important applications like emergency management, virtual property showcasing and interior design. These products rely on accurate 3D models of the environments considered, including information on both architectural and non-permanent elements. These models must be created from measured data such as RGB-D images or 3D point clouds, whose capture and consolidation involves lengthy data workflows. This strongly limits the rate at which 3D models can be produced, preventing the adoption of many digital services for indoor space management. We provide an alternative to such data-intensive procedures by presenting Walk2Map, a data-driven approach to generate floor plans only from trajectories of a person walking inside the rooms. Thanks to recent advances in data-driven inertial odometry, such minimalistic input data can be acquired from the IMU readings of consumer-level smartphones, which allows for an effortless and scalable mapping of real-world indoor spaces. Our work is based on learning the latent relation between an indoor walk trajectory and the information represented in a floor plan: interior space footprint, portals, and furniture. We distinguish between recovering area-related (interior footprint, furniture) and wall-related (doors) information and use two different neural architectures for the two tasks: an image-based Encoder-Decoder and a Graph Convolutional Network, respectively. We train our networks using scanned 3D indoor models and apply them in a cascaded fashion on an indoor walk trajectory at inference time. We perform a qualitative and quantitative evaluation using both simulated and measured, real-world trajectories, and compare against a baseline method for image-to-image translation. The experiments confirm the feasibility of our approach.\n",
      "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are of great importance to many real world applications, but they generally suffer from incomplete information in the form of missing relations between entities. Knowledge graph completion (also known as relation prediction) is the task of inferring missing facts given existing ones. Most of the existing work is proposed by maximizing the likelihood of observed instance-level triples. Not much attention, however, is paid to the ontological information, such as type information of entities and relations. In this work, we propose a type-augmented relation prediction (TaRP) method, where we apply both the type information and instance-level information for relation prediction. In particular, type information and instance-level information are encoded as prior probabilities and likelihoods of relations respectively, and are combined by following Bayes' rule. Our proposed TaRP method achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets: FB15K, FB15K-237, YAGO26K-906, and DB111K-174. In addition, we show that TaRP achieves significantly improved data efficiency. More importantly, the type information extracted from a specific dataset can generalize well to other datasets through the proposed TaRP model.\n",
      "Access to quality travel time information for roads in a road network has become increasingly important with the rising demand for real-time travel time estimation for paths within road networks. In the context of the Danish road network (DRN) dataset used in this paper, the data coverage is sparse and skewed towards arterial roads, with a coverage of 23.88% across 850,980 road segments, which makes travel time estimation difficult. Existing solutions for graph-based data processing often neglect the size of the graph, which is an apparent problem for road networks with a large amount of connected road segments. To this end, we propose a framework for predicting road segment travel speed histograms for dataless edges, based on a latent representation generated by an adversarially regularized convolutional network. We apply a partitioning algorithm to divide the graph into dense subgraphs, and then train a model for each subgraph to predict speed histograms for the nodes. The framework achieves an accuracy of 71.5% intersection and 78.5% correlation on predicting travel speed histograms using the DRN dataset. Furthermore, experiments show that partitioning the dataset into clusters increases the performance of the framework. Specifically, partitioning the road network dataset into 100 clusters, with approximately 500 road segments in each cluster, achieves a better performance than when using 10 and 20 clusters.\n",
      "Many few-shot learning approaches have been designed under the meta-learning framework, which learns from a variety of learning tasks and generalizes to new tasks. These meta-learning approaches achieve the expected performance in the scenario where all samples are drawn from the same distributions (i.i.d. observations). However, in real-world applications, few-shot learning paradigm often suffers from data shift, i.e., samples in different tasks, even in the same task, could be drawn from various data distributions. Most existing few-shot learning approaches are not designed with the consideration of data shift, and thus show downgraded performance when data distribution shifts. However, it is non-trivial to address the data shift problem in few-shot learning, due to the limited number of labeled samples in each task. Targeting at addressing this problem, we propose a novel metric-based meta-learning framework to extract task-specific representations and task-shared representations with the help of knowledge graph. The data shift within/between tasks can thus be combated by the combination of task-shared and task-specific representations. The proposed model is evaluated on popular benchmarks and two constructed new challenging datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate its remarkable performance.\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) manifest pathologies including over-smoothing and limited discriminating power as a result of suboptimally expressive aggregating mechanisms. We herein present a unifying framework for stochastic aggregation (STAG) in GNNs, where noise is (adaptively) injected into the aggregation process from the neighborhood to form node embeddings. We provide theoretical arguments that STAG models, with little overhead, remedy both of the aforementioned problems. In addition to fixed-noise models, we also propose probabilistic versions of STAG models and a variational inference framework to learn the noise posterior. We conduct illustrative experiments clearly targeting oversmoothing and multiset aggregation limitations. Furthermore, STAG enhances general performance of GNNs demonstrated by competitive performance in common citation and molecule graph benchmark datasets.\n",
      "Objective: This paper presents an Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection method based on learning structural similarity between Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) and representing this similarity as a graph. Methods: We construct the similarity graph using embedded features of the input image (i.e., Non-Demented (ND), Very Mild Demented (VMD), Mild Demented (MD), and Moderated Demented (MDTD)). We experiment and compare different dimension-reduction and clustering algorithms to construct the best similarity graph to capture the similarity between the same class images using the cosine distance as a similarity measure. We utilize the similarity graph to present (sample) the training data to a convolutional neural network (CNN). We use the similarity graph as a regularizer in the loss function of a CNN model to minimize the distance between the input images and their k-nearest neighbours in the similarity graph while minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss between the training image predictions and the actual image class labels. Results: We conduct extensive experiments with several pre-trained CNN models and compare the results to other recent methods. Conclusion: Our method achieves superior performance on the testing dataset (accuracy = 0.986, area under receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.998, F1 measure = 0.987). Significance: The classification results show an improvement in the prediction accuracy compared to the other methods. We release all the code used in our experiments to encourage reproducible research in this area\n",
      "This paper introduces a procedure for testing the identifiability of Bayesian models for causal inference. Although the do-calculus is sound and complete given a causal graph, many practical assumptions cannot be expressed in terms of graph structure alone, such as the assumptions required by instrumental variable designs, regression discontinuity designs, and within-subjects designs. We present simulation-based identifiability (SBI), a fully automated identification test based on a particle optimization scheme with simulated observations. This approach expresses causal assumptions as priors over functions in a structural causal model, including flexible priors using Gaussian processes. We prove that SBI is asymptotically sound and complete, and produces practical finite-sample bounds. We also show empirically that SBI agrees with known results in graph-based identification as well as with widely-held intuitions for designs in which graph-based methods are inconclusive.\n",
      "Causal structure discovery from observational data is fundamental to the causal understanding of autonomous systems such as medical decision support systems, advertising campaigns and self-driving cars. This is essential to solve well-known causal decision making and prediction problems associated with those real-world applications. Recently, recursive causal discovery algorithms have gained particular attention among the research community due to their ability to provide good results by using Conditional Independent (CI) tests in smaller sub-problems. However, each of such algorithms needs a refinement function to remove undesired causal relations of the discovered graphs. Notably, with the increase of the problem size, the computation cost (i.e., the number of CI-tests) of the refinement function makes an algorithm expensive to deploy in practice. This paper proposes a generic causal structure refinement strategy that can locate the undesired relations with a small number of CI-tests, thus speeding up the algorithm for large and complex problems. We theoretically prove the correctness of our algorithm. We then empirically evaluate its performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality and completion time in synthetic and real datasets.\n",
      "Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on node embeddings, which represent a node as a vector by its identity, type, or content. However, graphs with unlabeled nodes widely exist in real-world applications (e.g., anonymized social networks). Previous GNNs either assign random labels to nodes (which introduces artefacts to the GNN) or assign one embedding to all nodes (which fails to distinguish one node from another). In this paper, we analyze the limitation of existing approaches in two types of classification tasks, graph classification and node classification. Inspired by our analysis, we propose two techniques, Dynamic Labeling and Preferential Dynamic Labeling, that satisfy desired properties statistically or asymptotically for each type of the task. Experimental results show that we achieve high performance in various graph-related tasks.\n",
      "Deep learning models suffer from opaqueness. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), current research strategies for explaining models focus on the target classes within the associated training dataset. As a result, the understanding of hidden feature map activations is limited by the discriminative knowledge gleaned during training. The aim of our work is to explain and expand CNNs models via the mirroring or alignment of CNN to an external knowledge base. This will allow us to give a semantic context or label for each visual feature. We can match CNN feature activations to nodes in our external knowledge base. This supports knowledge-based interpretation of the features associated with model decisions. To demonstrate our approach, we build two separate graphs. We use an entity alignment method to align the feature nodes in a CNN with the nodes in a ConceptNet based knowledge graph. We then measure the proximity of CNN graph nodes to semantically meaningful knowledge base nodes. Our results show that in the aligned embedding space, nodes from the knowledge graph are close to the CNN feature nodes that have similar meanings, indicating that nodes from an external knowledge base can act as explanatory semantic references for features in the model. We analyse a variety of graph building methods in order to improve the results from our embedding space. We further demonstrate that by using hierarchical relationships from our external knowledge base, we can locate new unseen classes outside the CNN training set in our embeddings space, based on visual feature activations. This suggests that we can adapt our approach to identify unseen classes based on CNN feature activations. Our demonstrated approach of aligning a CNN with an external knowledge base paves the way to reason about and beyond the trained model, with future adaptations to explainable models and zero-shot learning.\n",
      "An important problem in causal inference is to break down the total effect of treatment into different causal pathways and quantify the causal effect in each pathway. Causal mediation analysis (CMA) is a formal statistical approach for identifying and estimating these causal effects. Central to CMA is the sequential ignorability assumption that implies all pre-treatment confounders are measured and they can capture different types of confounding, e.g., post-treatment confounders and hidden confounders. Typically unverifiable in observational studies, this assumption restrains both the coverage and practicality of conventional methods. This work, therefore, aims to circumvent the stringent assumption by following a causal graph with a unified confounder and its proxy variables. Our core contribution is an algorithm that combines deep latent-variable models and proxy strategy to jointly infer a unified surrogate confounder and estimate different causal effects in CMA from observed variables. Empirical evaluations using both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",
      "Studies on public transportation in Europe suggest that European inhabitants use buses in ca. 56% of all public transport travels. One of the critical factors affecting such a percentage and more, in general, the demand for public transport services, with an increasing reluctance to use them, is their quality. End-users can perceive quality from various perspectives, including the availability of information, i.e., the access to details about the transit and the provided services. The approach proposed in this paper, using innovative methodologies resorting on data mining and machine learning techniques, aims to make available the unavailable data about public transport. In particular, by mining GPS traces, we manage to reconstruct the complete transit graph of public transport. The approach has been successfully validated on a real dataset collected from the local bus system of the city of L'Aquila (Italy). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach and implemented framework are both effective and efficient, thus being ready for deployment.\n",
      "Our interest is in scientific problems with the following characteristics: (1) Data are naturally represented as graphs; (2) The amount of data available is typically small; and (3) There is significant domain-knowledge, usually expressed in some symbolic form. These kinds of problems have been addressed effectively in the past by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), by virtue of 2 important characteristics: (a) The use of a representation language that easily captures the relation encoded in graph-structured data, and (b) The inclusion of prior information encoded as domain-specific relations, that can alleviate problems of data scarcity, and construct new relations. Recent advances have seen the emergence of deep neural networks specifically developed for graph-structured data (Graph-based Neural Networks, or GNNs). While GNNs have been shown to be able to handle graph-structured data, less has been done to investigate the inclusion of domain-knowledge. Here we investigate this aspect of GNNs empirically by employing an operation we term \"vertex-enrichment\" and denote the corresponding GNNs as \"VEGNNs\". Using over 70 real-world datasets and substantial amounts of symbolic domain-knowledge, we examine the result of vertex-enrichment across 5 different variants of GNNs. Our results provide support for the following: (a) Inclusion of domain-knowledge by vertex-enrichment can significantly improve the performance of a GNN. That is, the performance VEGNNs is significantly better than GNNs across all GNN variants; (b) The inclusion of domain-specific relations constructed using ILP improves the performance of VEGNNs, across all GNN variants. Taken together, the results provide evidence that it is possible to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge into a GNN, and that ILP can play an important role in providing high-level relationships that are not easily discovered by a GNN.\n",
      "An effective understanding of the environment and accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding dynamic obstacles are indispensable for intelligent mobile systems (e.g. autonomous vehicles and social robots) to achieve safe and high-quality planning when they navigate in highly interactive and crowded scenarios. Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative neural system (called STG-DAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction involving heterogeneous agents. The system takes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. We also employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction. The constraint not only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. Moreover, the proposed prediction model can be easily adopted by multi-target tracking frameworks. The tracking accuracy proves to be improved by empirical results. The proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than various baseline approaches in terms of prediction and tracking accuracy.\n",
      "In this work we propose Pathfinder Discovery Networks (PDNs), a method for jointly learning a message passing graph over a multiplex network with a downstream semi-supervised model. PDNs inductively learn an aggregated weight for each edge, optimized to produce the best outcome for the downstream learning task. PDNs are a generalization of attention mechanisms on graphs which allow flexible construction of similarity functions between nodes, edge convolutions, and cheap multiscale mixing layers. We show that PDNs overcome weaknesses of existing methods for graph attention (e.g. Graph Attention Networks), such as the diminishing weight problem. Our experimental results demonstrate competitive predictive performance on academic node classification tasks. Additional results from a challenging suite of node classification experiments show how PDNs can learn a wider class of functions than existing baselines. We analyze the relative computational complexity of PDNs, and show that PDN runtime is not considerably higher than static-graph models. Finally, we discuss how PDNs can be used to construct an easily interpretable attention mechanism that allows users to understand information propagation in the graph.\n",
      "Recurrent graph convolutional neural networks are highly effective machine learning techniques for spatiotemporal signal processing. Newly proposed graph neural network architectures are repetitively evaluated on standard tasks such as traffic or weather forecasting. In this paper, we propose the Chickenpox Cases in Hungary dataset as a new dataset for comparing graph neural network architectures. Our time series analysis and forecasting experiments demonstrate that the Chickenpox Cases in Hungary dataset is adequate for comparing the predictive performance and forecasting capabilities of novel recurrent graph neural network architectures.\n",
      "Graph-based subspace clustering methods have exhibited promising performance. However, they still suffer some of these drawbacks: encounter the expensive time overhead, fail in exploring the explicit clusters, and cannot generalize to unseen data points. In this work, we propose a scalable graph learning framework, seeking to address the above three challenges simultaneously. Specifically, it is based on the ideas of anchor points and bipartite graph. Rather than building a $n\\times n$ graph, where $n$ is the number of samples, we construct a bipartite graph to depict the relationship between samples and anchor points. Meanwhile, a connectivity constraint is employed to ensure that the connected components indicate clusters directly. We further establish the connection between our method and the K-means clustering. Moreover, a model to process multi-view data is also proposed, which is linear scaled with respect to $n$. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach with respect to many state-of-the-art clustering methods.\n",
      "Graphs are one of the most efficacious structures for representing datapoints and their relations, and they have been largely exploited for different applications. Previously, the higher-order relations between the nodes have been modeled by a generalization of graphs known as hypergraphs. In hypergraphs, the edges are defined by a set of nodes i.e., hyperedges to demonstrate the higher order relationships between the data. However, there is no explicit higher-order generalization for nodes themselves. In this work, we introduce a novel generalization of graphs i.e., K-Nearest Hyperplanes graph (KNH) where the nodes are defined by higher order Euclidean subspaces for multi-view modeling of the nodes. In fact, in KNH, nodes are hyperplanes or more precisely m-flats instead of datapoints. We experimentally evaluate the KNH graph on two multi-aspect datasets for misinformation detection. The experimental results suggest that multi-view modeling of articles using KNH graph outperforms the classic KNN graph in terms of classification performance.\n",
      "Traffic forecasting is important for the success of intelligent transportation systems. Deep learning models, including convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have been extensively applied in traffic forecasting problems to model spatial and temporal dependencies. In recent years, to model the graph structures in transportation systems as well as contextual information, graph neural networks have been introduced and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a series of traffic forecasting problems. In this survey, we review the rapidly growing body of research using different graph neural networks, e.g. graph convolutional and graph attention networks, in various traffic forecasting problems, e.g. road traffic flow and speed forecasting, passenger flow forecasting in urban rail transit systems, and demand forecasting in ride-hailing platforms. We also present a comprehensive list of open data and source resources for each problem and identify future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey that explores the application of graph neural networks for traffic forecasting problems. We have also created a public GitHub repository where the latest papers, open data, and source resources will be updated.\n",
      "Knowledge graph embedding methods learn embeddings of entities and relations in a low dimensional space which can be used for various downstream machine learning tasks such as link prediction and entity matching. Various graph convolutional network methods have been proposed which use different types of information to learn the features of entities and relations. However, these methods assign the same weight (importance) to the neighbors when aggregating the information, ignoring the role of different relations with the neighboring entities. To this end, we propose a relation-aware graph attention model that leverages relation information to compute different weights to the neighboring nodes for learning embeddings of entities and relations. We evaluate our proposed approach on link prediction and entity matching tasks. Our experimental results on link prediction on three datasets (one proprietary and two public) and results on unsupervised entity matching on one proprietary dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the relation-aware attention.\n",
      "Ubiquitous mobile computing have enabled ride-hailing services to collect vast amounts of behavioral data of riders and drivers and optimize supply and demand matching in real time. While these mobility service providers have some degree of control over the market by assigning vehicles to requests, they need to deal with the uncertainty arising from self-interested driver behavior since workers are usually free to drive when they are not assigned tasks. In this work, we formulate the problem of passenger-vehicle matching in a sparsely connected graph and proposed an algorithm to derive an equilibrium policy in a multi-agent environment. Our framework combines value iteration methods to estimate the optimal policy given expected state visitation and policy propagation to compute multi-agent state visitation frequencies. Furthermore, we developed a method to learn the driver's reward function transferable to an environment with significantly different dynamics from training data. We evaluated the robustness to changes in spatio-temporal supply-demand distributions and deterioration in data quality using a real-world taxi trajectory dataset; our approach significantly outperforms several baselines in terms of imitation accuracy. The computational time required to obtain an equilibrium policy shared by all vehicles does not depend on the number of agents, and even on the scale of real-world services, it takes only a few seconds on a single CPU.\n",
      "Adversarial Machine Learning has emerged as a substantial subfield of Computer Science due to a lack of robustness in the models we train along with crowdsourcing practices that enable attackers to tamper with data. In the last two years, interest has surged in adversarial attacks on graphs yet the Graph Classification setting remains nearly untouched. Since a Graph Classification dataset consists of discrete graphs with class labels, related work has forgone direct gradient optimization in favor of an indirect Reinforcement Learning approach. We will study the novel problem of Data Poisoning (training time) attack on Neural Networks for Graph Classification using Reinforcement Learning Agents.\n",
      "Current deep learning (DL) systems rely on a centralized computing paradigm which limits the amount of available training data, increases system latency, and adds privacy and security constraints. On-device learning, enabled by decentralized and distributed training of DL models over peer-to-peer wirelessly connected edge devices, not only alleviate the above limitations but also enable next-gen applications that need DL models to continuously interact and learn from their environment. However, this necessitates the development of novel training algorithms that train DL models over time-varying and directed peer-to-peer graph structures while minimizing the amount of communication between the devices and also being resilient to non-IID data distributions. In this work we propose, Sparse-Push, a communication efficient decentralized distributed training algorithm that supports training over peer-to-peer, directed, and time-varying graph topologies. The proposed algorithm enables 466x reduction in communication with only 1% degradation in performance when training various DL models such as ResNet-20 and VGG11 over the CIFAR-10 dataset. Further, we demonstrate how communication compression can lead to significant performance degradation in-case of non-IID datasets, and propose Skew-Compensated Sparse Push algorithm that recovers this performance drop while maintaining similar levels of communication compression.\n",
      "Bone age assessment is challenging in clinical practice due to the complicated bone age assessment process. Current automatic bone age assessment methods were designed with rare consideration of the diagnostic logistics and thus may yield certain uninterpretable hidden states and outputs. Consequently, doctors can find it hard to cooperate with such models harmoniously because it is difficult to check the correctness of the model predictions. In this work, we propose a new graph-based deep learning framework for bone age assessment with hand radiographs, called Doctor Imitator (DI). The architecture of DI is designed to learn the diagnostic logistics of doctors using the scoring methods (e.g., the Tanner-Whitehouse method) for bone age assessment. Specifically, the convolutions of DI capture the local features of the anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) on hand radiographs and predict the ROI scores by our proposed Anatomy-based Group Convolution, summing up for bone age prediction. Besides, we develop a novel Dual Graph-based Attention module to compute patient-specific attention for ROI features and context attention for ROI scores. As far as we know, DI is the first automatic bone age assessment framework following the scoring methods without fully supervised hand radiographs. Experiments on hand radiographs with only bone age supervision verify that DI can achieve excellent performance with sparse parameters and provide more interpretability.\n",
      "We consider the problem where $N$ agents collaboratively interact with an instance of a stochastic $K$ arm bandit problem for $K \\gg N$. The agents aim to simultaneously minimize the cumulative regret over all the agents for a total of $T$ time steps, the number of communication rounds, and the number of bits in each communication round. We present Limited Communication Collaboration - Upper Confidence Bound (LCC-UCB), a doubling-epoch based algorithm where each agent communicates only after the end of the epoch and shares the index of the best arm it knows. With our algorithm, LCC-UCB, each agent enjoys a regret of $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{({K/N}+ N)T}\\right)$, communicates for $O(\\log T)$ steps and broadcasts $O(\\log K)$ bits in each communication step. We extend the work to sparse graphs with maximum degree $K_G$, and diameter $D$ and propose LCC-UCB-GRAPH which enjoys a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}\\left(D\\sqrt{(K/N+ K_G)DT}\\right)$. Finally, we empirically show that the LCC-UCB and the LCC-UCB-GRAPH algorithm perform well and outperform strategies that communicate through a central node\n",
      "Graph neural networks (GNNs) work well when the graph structure is provided. However, this structure may not always be available in real-world applications. One solution to this problem is to infer a task-specific latent structure and then apply a GNN to the inferred graph. Unfortunately, the space of possible graph structures grows super-exponentially with the number of nodes and so the task-specific supervision may be insufficient for learning both the structure and the GNN parameters. In this work, we propose the Simultaneous Learning of Adjacency and GNN Parameters with Self-supervision, or SLAPS, a method that provides more supervision for inferring a graph structure through self-supervision. A comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that SLAPS scales to large graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes and outperforms several models that have been proposed to learn a task-specific graph structure on established benchmarks.\n",
      "Design of new drug compounds with target properties is a key area of research in generative modeling. We present a small drug molecule design pipeline based on graph-generative models and a comparison study of two state-of-the-art graph generative models for designing COVID-19 targeted drug candidates: 1) a variational autoencoder-based approach (VAE) that uses prior knowledge of molecules that have been shown to be effective for earlier coronavirus treatments and 2) a deep Q-learning method (DQN) that generates optimized molecules without any proximity constraints. We evaluate the novelty of the automated molecule generation approaches by validating the candidate molecules with drug-protein binding affinity models. The VAE method produced two novel molecules with similar structures to the antiretroviral protease inhibitor Indinavir that show potential binding affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 protein target 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL-protease).\n",
      "We build on the recently proposed EigenGame that views eigendecomposition as a competitive game. EigenGame's updates are biased if computed using minibatches of data, which hinders convergence and more sophisticated parallelism in the stochastic setting. In this work, we propose an unbiased stochastic update that is asymptotically equivalent to EigenGame, enjoys greater parallelism allowing computation on datasets of larger sample sizes, and outperforms EigenGame in experiments. We present applications to finding the principal components of massive datasets and performing spectral clustering of graphs. We analyze and discuss our proposed update in the context of EigenGame and the shift in perspective from optimization to games.\n",
      "We theoretically investigate the performance of $\\ell_{1}$-regularized linear regression ($\\ell_1$-LinR) for the problem of Ising model selection using the replica method from statistical mechanics.

Our results show that despite model misspecification, the $\\ell_1$-LinR estimator can successfully recover the graph structure of the Ising model with $N$ variables using $M=\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\log N\\right)$ samples, which is of the same order as that of $\\ell_{1}$-regularized logistic regression. Moreover, we provide a computationally efficient method to accurately predict the non-asymptotic performance of the $\\ell_1$-LinR estimator with moderate $M$ and $N$. Simulations show an excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results, which supports our findings.\n",
      "We consider convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble learning with the objective function inspired by least action principle; it includes resource consumption component. We teach an agent to perceive images through the set of pre-trained classifiers and want the resulting dynamically configured system to unfold the computational graph with the trajectory that refers to the minimal number of operations and maximal expected accuracy. The proposed agent's architecture implicitly approximates the required classifier selection function with the help of reinforcement learning. Our experimental results prove, that if the agent exploits the dynamic (and context-dependent) structure of computations, it outperforms conventional ensemble learning.\n",
      "Predicting (1) when the next hospital admission occurs and (2) what will happen in the next admission about a patient by mining electronic health record (EHR) data can provide granular readmission predictions to assist clinical decision making. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and point process models are usually employed in modelling temporal sequential data. Simple RNN models assume that sequences of hospital visits follow strict causal dependencies between consecutive visits. However, in the real-world, a patient may have multiple co-existing chronic medical conditions, i.e., multimorbidity, which results in a cascade of visits where a non-immediate historical visit can be most influential to the next visit. Although a point process (e.g., Hawkes process) is able to model a cascade temporal relationship, it strongly relies on a prior generative process assumption. We propose a novel model, MEDCAS, to address these challenges. MEDCAS combines the strengths of RNN-based models and point processes by integrating point processes in modelling visit types and time gaps into an attention-based sequence-to-sequence learning model, which is able to capture the temporal cascade relationships. To supplement the patients with short visit sequences, a structural modelling technique with graph-based methods is used to construct the markers of the point process in MEDCAS. Extensive experiments on three real-world EHR datasets have been performed and the results demonstrate that \\texttt{MEDCAS} outperforms state-of-the-art models in both tasks.\n",
      "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordination to efficiently solve certain tasks. Fully centralized control is often infeasible in such domains due to the size of joint action spaces. Coordination graph based formalization allows reasoning about the joint action based on the structure of interactions. However, they often require domain expertise in their design. This paper introduces the deep implicit coordination graph (DICG) architecture for such scenarios. DICG consists of a module for inferring the dynamic coordination graph structure which is then used by a graph neural network based module to learn to implicitly reason about the joint actions or values. DICG allows learning the tradeoff between full centralization and decentralization via standard actor-critic methods to significantly improve coordination for domains with large number of agents. We apply DICG to both centralized-training-centralized-execution and centralized-training-decentralized-execution regimes. We demonstrate that DICG solves the relative overgeneralization pathology in predatory-prey tasks as well as outperforms various MARL baselines on the challenging StarCraft II Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC) and traffic junction environments.\n",
      "The area of graph embeddings is currently dominated by contrastive learning methods, which demand formulation of an explicit objective function and sampling of positive and negative examples. This creates a conceptual and computational overhead. Simple, classic unsupervised approaches like Multidimensional Scaling (MSD) or the Laplacian eigenmap skip the necessity of tedious objective optimization, directly exploiting data geometry. Unfortunately, their reliance on very costly operations such as matrix eigendecomposition make them unable to scale to large graphs that are common in today's digital world. In this paper we present Cleora: an algorithm which gets the best of two worlds, being both unsupervised and highly scalable. We show that high quality embeddings can be produced without the popular step-wise learning framework with example sampling. An intuitive learning objective of our algorithm is that a node should be similar to its neighbors, without explicitly pushing disconnected nodes apart. The objective is achieved by iterative weighted averaging of node neigbors' embeddings, followed by normalization across dimensions. Thanks to the averaging operation the algorithm makes rapid strides across the embedding space and usually reaches optimal embeddings in just a few iterations. Cleora runs faster than other state-of-the-art CPU algorithms and produces embeddings of competitive quality as measured on downstream tasks: link prediction and node classification. We show that Cleora learns a data abstraction that is similar to contrastive methods, yet at much lower computational cost. We open-source Cleora under the MIT license allowing commercial use under https://github.com/Synerise/cleora.\n",
      "Process models generated through process mining depict the as-is state of a process. Through annotations with metrics such as the frequency or duration of activities, these models provide generic information to the process analyst. To improve business processes with respect to performance measures, process analysts require further guidance from the process model. In this study, we design Graph Relevance Miner (GRM), a technique based on graph neural networks, to determine the relevance scores for process activities with respect to performance measures. Annotating process models with such relevance scores facilitates a problem-focused analysis of the business process, placing these problems at the centre of the analysis. We quantitatively evaluate the predictive quality of our technique using four datasets from different domains, to demonstrate the faithfulness of the relevance scores. Furthermore, we present the results of a case study, which highlight the utility of the technique for organisations. Our work has important implications both for research and business applications, because process model-based analyses feature shortcomings that need to be urgently addressed to realise successful process mining at an enterprise level.\n",
      "Graph-structured data ubiquitously appears in science and engineering. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit the relational inductive bias exhibited in graphs; they have been shown to outperform other forms of neural networks in scenarios where structure information supplements node features. The most common GNN architecture aggregates information from neighborhoods based on message passing. Its generality has made it broadly applicable. In this paper, we focus on a special, yet widely used, type of graphs -- DAGs -- and inject a stronger inductive bias -- partial ordering -- into the neural network design. We propose the \\emph{directed acyclic graph neural network}, DAGNN, an architecture that processes information according to the flow defined by the partial order. DAGNN can be considered a framework that entails earlier works as special cases (e.g., models for trees and models updating node representations recurrently), but we identify several crucial components that prior architectures lack. We perform comprehensive experiments, including ablation studies, on representative DAG datasets (i.e., source code, neural architectures, and probabilistic graphical models) and demonstrate the superiority of DAGNN over simpler DAG architectures as well as general graph architectures.\n",
      "Most existing popular methods for learning graph embedding only consider fixed-order global structural features and lack structures hierarchical representation. To address this weakness, we propose a novel graph embedding algorithm named GraphCSC that realizes classification based on skeleton information using fixed-order structures learned in anonymous random walks manner, and component information using different size subgraphs. Two graphs are similar if their skeletons and components are both similar, thus in our model, we integrate both of them together into embeddings as graph homogeneity characterization. We demonstrate our model on different datasets in comparison with a comprehensive list of up-to-date state-of-the-art baselines, and experiments show that our work is superior in real-world graph classification tasks.\n",
      "As large-scale graphs become increasingly more prevalent, it poses significant computational challenges to process, extract and analyze large graph data. Graph coarsening is one popular technique to reduce the size of a graph while maintaining essential properties. Despite rich graph coarsening literature, there is only limited exploration of data-driven methods in the field. In this work, we leverage the recent progress of deep learning on graphs for graph coarsening. We first propose a framework for measuring the quality of coarsening algorithm and show that depending on the goal, we need to carefully choose the Laplace operator on the coarse graph and associated projection/lift operators. Motivated by the observation that the current choice of edge weight for the coarse graph may be sub-optimal, we parametrize the weight assignment map with graph neural networks and train it to improve the coarsening quality in an unsupervised way. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real networks, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves common graph coarsening methods under various metrics, reduction ratios, graph sizes, and graph types. It generalizes to graphs of larger size ($25\\times$ of training graphs), is adaptive to different losses (differentiable and non-differentiable), and scales to much larger graphs than previous work.\n",
      "Human actions involving hand manipulations are structured according to the making and breaking of hand-object contact, and human visual understanding of action is reliant on anticipation of contact as is demonstrated by pioneering work in cognitive science. Taking inspiration from this, we introduce representations and models centered on contact, which we then use in action prediction and anticipation. We annotate a subset of the EPIC Kitchens dataset to include time-to-contact between hands and objects, as well as segmentations of hands and objects. Using these annotations we train the Anticipation Module, a module producing Contact Anticipation Maps and Next Active Object Segmentations - novel low-level representations providing temporal and spatial characteristics of anticipated near future action. On top of the Anticipation Module we apply Egocentric Object Manipulation Graphs (Ego-OMG), a framework for action anticipation and prediction. Ego-OMG models longer term temporal semantic relations through the use of a graph modeling transitions between contact delineated action states. Use of the Anticipation Module within Ego-OMG produces state-of-the-art results, achieving 1st and 2nd place on the unseen and seen test sets, respectively, of the EPIC Kitchens Action Anticipation Challenge, and achieving state-of-the-art results on the tasks of action anticipation and action prediction over EPIC Kitchens. We perform ablation studies over characteristics of the Anticipation Module to evaluate their utility."

       "'Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts, and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of 90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream tasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.'"
